Nested track folders
To improve track organization, Cakewalk now supports nested track folders. A nested folder is a subfolder that is contained within
another parent folder. Nested subfolders allow you to organize tracks more logically. For example, you can have a “Guitar” parent
folder that contains “Electric” and “Acoustic” subfolders.

To only move tracks into another folder, drag one of the tracks or select Move To... from the context menu of one of the tracks.
To move the entire folder, drag the folder itself onto another folder, or select Move To... from the context menu of the folder.
If a track is in a folder, selecting Move To Folder > New Track Folder will create a new sub-folder at the same level of that track.

48

New features
Nested track folders

Note: As with the top level folders, any empty folders (i.e. specifically, folders containing no tracks) will ALWAYS appear below
those containing tracks.

Tip: When changing the color of a track folder, hold down the CTRL key to apply the same color to all child tracks within the folder.

New behavior when dragging tracks/folders:

 Dragging a track to the left side moves it out of the folder.
 Dragging to the right side moves it to the bottom of the existing folder at the target location (i.e. same level as the track above).

Tip: While dragging, look at the left edge of the drop indicator - it will be exactly at the folder depth the track will be placed at.

Expand/collapse track folder modifiers:

 SHIFT+click on folder +/- to expand/collapse the entire folder hierarchy of the folder you clicked on
 CTRL+SHIFT+click on folder +/- to expand/collapse all folders in the project
This is convenient if you want to quickly expand the hierarchy to search for a track, but then want to collapse it all.

Track templates and folders
The Save as Track Template context menu is only available on tracks, not on folders. If you want to save a track template with
folders, you must right-click on one of the tracks within the folder.
A track template cannot contain empty folders.
For details, see “Working with track templates” on page 486.
See:
“Track folders” on page 549

Misc. enhancements
Localization update
The French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese and Russian versions of Cakewalk have been updated.
To change the display language, go to Edit > Preferences > Customization - Display and select the desired language under
Language.
See:
“Customization - Display” on page 1710

Updated SDKs
 Upgrade to VST3 SDK 3.7.3
 Upgrade to ELASTIQUE SDK 3.3.9 (contains fixes for ELASTIQUE stretching)
 Upgrade to latest ARA 2.0 SDK
Behavior changes
 In order to accommodate screen readers, the TAB key is no longer bound to “Tab to transients” by default. You can re-enable this
function again in Edit > Preferences > Customization - Keyboard Shortcuts; bind the TAB key to AudioSnap Go To Next
Transient Marker and bind SHIFT+TAB to AudioSnap Go To Previous Transient Marker.

 The Archive button

is now a tri-state button in order to indicate if a track folder contains a mixture of archived and unarchived

tracks.

Note: If you use a custom user theme, you must update the theme in Theme Editor in order for the Archive button
to display
correctly. For details, see “UI themes” on page 270 and “Cakewalk Theme Editor” on page 272. In the meantime, switch to the
factory Tungsten or Mercury theme.

See:
“TAB to transients” on page 518
“Key bindings” on page 1261
“New features” on page 43

Solo, Exclusive Solo and Solo Override improvements
The internals for track and bus solo have been greatly improved to handle more complex routing scenarios with tracks and buses
outputting to aux tracks and sidechains.
Prior to the 2021.11 release, there were scenarios where soloing intermediate tracks or buses would not solo all the parts of the
signal flow.
Additionally, solo override now works consistently with aux tracks and tracks containing active sidechains. Dim solo has also been
made aware of the solo override state and works consistently.
See:
“Soloing tracks” on page 299
“Dim Solo mode” on page 300
“Exclusive Solo mode” on page 301
“Solo Override” on page 301

 An intuitive new UI with collapsible panels to make it easier to get to the most commonly used features. For details, see
“Redesigned Export Audio dialog” on page 53.

 Task queues for batch exporting. For details, see “Batch exporting audio files using task queues” on page 56.
 Complete control over output file names using tag based file name presets. Export presets can now also store a default filename.
For details, see “Using export filename tags and presets” on page 59.

 New additional export source categories:
 Tracks Through Entire Mix. For track stems, exports the audio from each chosen track as heard through the main output.
This is a useful way to create track stems as heard through master effects.

 Track Folders. For any non-empty track folders.
 Arranger sections. Allows you to export each individual arrangement section as a separate audio file.
 Improvements to handling of export for aux tracks and tracks with sidechains. For details, see “Improved handling of aux tracks
and sidechains when exporting or soloing tracks” on page 67.

 Export uses significantly less memory and runs faster by eliminating making an extra copy of the project in memory.
 Support for setting the export buffer size independently from the audio driver buffer size. Setting a higher export buffer size can
significantly speed up export operations. (Max size is 350 msec).

 Convenient access to track selection and mute/solo tracks directly from the Export Audio dialog box.
 Set export time ranges or export entire project directly from the Export Audio dialog box. Even use project landmarks like
markers and loop/punch regions to set the selection start/end locations.

 Automatic effects tail flushing is now part of export/bounce to prevent left over effects tails from leaking into exports or being
heard. For details, see “Automatic effects tails flushing during bounce” on page 68.

 New default Export Audio Files folder setting in Edit > Preferences > File - Folder Locations. For details, see “Default ‘Export
Audio Files’ folder” on page 66.

 Toast notification on export completion with link to the completed render. For details, see “Toast notification with link to open
export location” on page 69.

The Export Audio dialog box (File > Export > Audio) has been completely redesigned to streamline workflow and make it easier to
get to the most commonly used features. Related settings are organized into collapsible panels. The size, position and expanded
state of each section is remembered when you close the dialog box.
The Export Audio dialog box contains the following settings:

 Preset. You can create presets of export settings. A preset stores the following settings:
 Filename
 Format settings (except Bounce Buffer Size)
 What to Export source category
 Mix and Render settings

New features

53

 Filename and Location. Filename and location are shown as two separate fields. Filename is the name of the file you want
your exported audio to be called, and location is the directory where it should be saved.

 When you first open the dialog, the location will be set to the default location as specified in Edit > Preferences > File Folder Locations under Export Audio Files. The default is \Audio Exports under the current project directory, where the
current project folder is indicated by the %PROJECTFOLDER% environment variable.

 You can change the export directory by clicking on the browse location button, and this location will be remembered for the
duration of the project’s session. You can change the global export location for all projects with the Export Audio Files path in
Edit > Preferences > File - Folder Locations.

 Filename tokens. Filenames now support substitution tags for common project and export properties. You can type tags
directly into the filename edit box, or use the filename builder pop-up to add them for you. You can still type while this pop-up
is showing, so you can mix literal characters with tags, or use backspace to correct any mistakes. For details, see “Using
export filename tags and presets” on page 59.
• Filename presets let you save and recall custom filename formats.
• The filename itself now supports both literal characters and substitution tags (“tokens”). Substitution tags replace tags within
the filename with common project and export properties. Each tag is contained within curly brackets.
• You can type in the tags directly into the filename edit box, or use the filename builder pop-up to add them for you. It’s worth
mentioning that you can still type while this pop-up is showing, so you can mix literal characters with tags, or use backspace
to correct any mistakes.
• A preview of the first audio export filename is shown below the filename edit box.

 Format. Specify the file type, channel format, sample rate, bit depth, and dithering method.
 The Bounce Buffer Size (ms) setting controls the buffer size for export independently of the playback latency buffer size
when Render in Real-time is disabled. The default settings uses the current playback buffer size (max size is 200 msec). A
larger buffer size can speed up the export process in large projects by allowing the CPU to process data more efficiently, but
will use more memory. The playback latency buffer size is used when Render in Real-time is enabled.

 What to Export. Specify which audio sources to export.
 The following source categories have been added:
• Tracks Through Entire Mix. Exports individual tracks, including all downstream bus effects and automation, as heard
through the main output. The result is the same as if you solo one track at a time during export.
• Track Folders. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each track
folder that you select in the Sources list, as heard through the main output. The result is the same as if you solo one track
folder at a time during export.
• Arranger Sections. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each
Arranger section that you select in the Sources list, as heard through the main output.

 Tracks/Buses in Project. Export works on the current project selection. You can modify the current track selection and the
mute and solo status of each track and bus, without exiting the Export Audio dialog box. This is especially convenient if you
if you want to create several tasks, each with a different selection, or if you want to export multiple stems. Simply solo the
tracks that you want to include in the stem, then add as a new task.
• A track that is checked means it’s included in the selection. If all the tracks are unchecked, that means there is no selection,
and all tracks will be available.
• Changing the project selection changes which source items are available.

 Search. The search filter lets you search for a particular source should you have a large number of sources to search
through. The search filter is available for all source categories except Hardware Outputs, Entire Mix, and Clips.

 Mix and Render. When all Mix and Render options are selected, the export will sound the same as playback. You can check or
uncheck each of the options to include or exclude them from the exported audio file(s).

54

New features
Export enhancements

 Range. Specify the time range to be exported:
 Entire Project. The entire length of the project.
 Time Selection. A specified time selection. The Start and End edit boxes allow you to manually enter the start and end
times of the export range. Click the

/

button to toggle between musical (Measures:Beats:Ticks)

and absolute

(Hours:Minutes:Seconds:Frames)
time. Click the
buttons to choose a time based on defined project landmarks, such
as the beginning of the project, the now time, or marker locations.
• Set Time Selection to Loop Range. Set the selection start and end times to the Loop From and Loop Thru times.
• Set Time Selection to Punch Range. Set the selection start and end times to the Punch In and Punch Out times.

 Add Task to Queue

. Create a new task from the current export settings and add it to the queue. For details, see “Batch
exporting audio files using task queues” on page 56.

 Task Queue. The task queue allows you to create multiple export tasks and run them all as a batch. A task in the export queue
contains the set of export settings including the mix settings, export file name, selection, location, and the time range. The export
queue is saved in the project and can be recalled and re-executed. Any prompts appear at the time of adding the task, so you can
run the whole queue without any user intervention.

 Run Tasks. Batch export all selected tasks in the task queue
 Export. Export a single job with the current export settings. Upon completion, a toast notification appears with a link to open the
export location.
For details, see “Export Audio dialog” on page 1614.

Batch exporting audio files using task queues
Using the Export button is fine if you have a single export. But what if you want to tweak your project and export again, or you want
several different types of exports? You may want a task for exporting your stems, another task for exporting individual tracks, and
another for exporting your final mix as a stereo file.
You can create multiple export tasks, such as stems or different file formats, and add them to an export queue. A task in the export
queue contains the set of export settings including the mix settings, filename, location, selection, and the time range. You can add as
many export tasks as you like, and run all export tasks as a batch without any user intervention.
The task queue is per project and is saved with the project.

Adding a task to the queue
1. To create a task, simply go through the normal process of defining your export, then instead of clicking the Export button, click
the Add Task to Queue button

. This adds a task with the current settings to the task queue.

If you are exporting multiple files as part of a task, a list of the filenames will be shown in a confirmation prompt. Any further
prompts required for additional format settings will also be shown at this time, and … that way, you won’t get any prompts when
you actually run the task.
2. Once you’ve confirmed any prompts, enter a name for your new task. Simply type the name of the task in, and press ENTER.
Tip: The name of the task can also be used in your filename by using the {taskname} tag.

3. Repeat the above steps for any additional tasks you need.
To the right of the task name you’ll see the number of files to be exported by each task, an estimated size (if it’s a wave file), and
a summary of the file format.

Editing tasks in the task queue
You can update tasks that you already added to a task queue. To update an existing task:
1. Do one of the following:

 Double-click on the task within the task list.
 Click the task’s menu button

, then select Recall Task Settings.

The task’s settings are recalled in the Export Audio dialog box.
2. Make any desired edits to the current export settings.
3. Click the task’s menu button

, then select Open Export Location.

Using export filename tags and presets
You can use “tokens” to define filenames for exported audio files. Tokens allow you to use placeholder tags that automatically extract
the corresponding information (such as the project name, artist, sample rate, bit depth, current date or time, etc.) from a project and
adds it to the resulting filename.
For example, instead of manually typing the project name and date into the filename edit box, you can enter the following:
{projectname}_{d}
This will automatically use the project’s name and the current date. Each token is enclosed by curly brackets (aka braces), e.g. {d}.

Adding filename tags
To enter a tag, do one of the following:

 Click the Build File Name Using Tags button

to open the Tags panel, then click a tag. You can still type while this pop-up is
showing, so you can mix literal characters with tags, or use backspace to correct any mistakes.

 Type in the tags directly into the filename edit box. Be sure to enclose each token by curly brackets (aka braces), e.g. {d}.
Tokens are case sensitive.
Tip: Use separator characters like space, dash or underscore if you wish to visually separate the tags.

Note: Most tags have a long token and a short token. For example, the project name token can be {projectname} or {P}.
Each tag’s tooltip shows its full and abbreviated tokens. To always use abbreviated tokens when you click a tag, select Use
Abbreviated Tokens in the filename tags panel. You can freely use either format.

Improved handling of aux tracks and sidechains when exporting or soloing
tracks
When exporting with Source Category set to Tracks, sidechain or aux track sends or outputs are now properly included in the
export for the track containing the sidechain. The same applies to aux tracks. Please note that it is still necessary for the sending
tracks to be included in the tracks exported. This limitation may be removed in the future.
When soloing a track that contains a sidechain plugin, any sends from other tracks in the project are now automatically included,
similarly to how it behaves with sends to aux tracks.

Automatic effects tails flushing during bounce
Many VST plug-ins do not properly flush their effects tails via reset state transitions. In some cases, exporting multiple clips or
arrangements could result in tails unexpectedly appearing in the export/bounce.
To address this, Cakewalk now automatically flushes effects tails during export/bounce operations to prevent left over effects tails
from leaking into exports or being heard.
By default, tails are flushed until a threshold of -70dB is reached or 20 seconds of silence is detected, whichever occurs first. The dB
threshold and max duration can be specified via the following Aud.ini variables that can be set in Edit > Preferences > Audio Configuration File:
BounceFlushTailsMaxDurationSec=n (0 to 60; default is 20; set to 0 to disable tails flushing) Effects tails maximum flush
length while bouncing (seconds).
BounceFlushTailsThresholdDb=n (-120 to -40; default is -70) Effects tails flush gain threshold while bouncing (dB).
On export, the audio engine will first hard flush any effects tails from all active plug-ins referenced in the project, including track/bus
effects, clip effects, effects chains, ProChannel as well as instruments. Flushing tails is done both pre and post bounce/export in
order to prevent unwanted tails from sounding after a bounce or appearing in exports after playing a project.
Effects tails flushing is done in efficiently using parallel processing when the multi processing engine is enabled and is normally very
fast. Flushing progress is shown on the toolbar during the bounce. If you wish to disable this, set
BounceFlushTailsMaxDurationSec to zero.
See:

Improved AudioSnap transient detection

New default AudioSnap transient detection algorithm
The transient detection algorithm has been greatly improved to more accurately detect audio transients in a variety of source
material.
Transients are useful when using AudioSnap and are also used for time stretching as well as when snapping to the transient pool.
The AudioSnap transient detection method can now be specified in Edit > Preferences > Project - AudioSnap under Transient
Detection. There are three methods:

 Magnitude
 Spectral (default for legacy projects)
 Multi-Resolution (default for new projects)
Multi-Resolution is the new default transient detection method for new projects, and Spectral and Magnitude are the older legacy
modes. The Multi-Resolution transient detection algorithm provides improved transient analysis that works well with most audio
source material.
The detection mode is stored in the project and older projects will continue to use Spectral until changed via Edit > Preferences >
Project - AudioSnap.

Note: The new transient analysis will not be used by default on previously saved projects. You must explicitly pick the MultiResolution algorithm from Edit > Preferences > Project - AudioSnap before this will take effect for that project. Once you
resave the project with this change it will continue to use the new algorithm for all audio.

70

New features
Improved AudioSnap transient detection

When the detection method is changed, you will be prompted that project audio waveforms will be recomputed. After regeneration of
the waveforms are complete, the new transients will be visible when switching the edit filter to Transients. The default transient
threshold (available in the AudioSnap palette) is different for each transient detector mode. Note that any edited transients are
retained when switching the transient detector mode.

Mackie Control revspread VPot DataType

On the Mackie Control surface, a VPot’s datatype defines the type of control being edited and how it should be displayed on the
VPot LED halo.
Currently, the Mackie Control surface supports a spread DataType for the LEDs that surround the VPots. The LEDs start in the
middle for small values, then "spread" around the VPot for larger values.
With certain parameter types, such as an equalizer "Q" setting, where a small Q value means a large spread, and a large Q value
means a narrow spread, the VPots show the opposite in the LED spread, which is confusing.
To address this, the Mackie Control surface now supports a new revspread VPot DataType that can be assigned in
MackieControl.ini (C:\Program Files\Cakewalk\Shared Surfaces). With the revspread VPot DataType, high values
show a narrow LED spread, and low values show a wide LED spread. This doesn't affect the actual numerical value being shown,
just the way the LEDs spread around the VPot.
For details, see the instructions in MackieControl.ini.

Allow multiple MIDI files to be dragged into a project simultaneously
You can now import multiple MIDI files into a project by dragging from Windows or the Media Browser.
By default, multiple tracks are created. To import back-to-back instead, hold down CTRL+SHIFT when dragging the MIDI files into a
project.
See:
“Adding Browser objects to your project” on page 723

ASIO driver compatibility checking
Some ASIO drivers, such as Realtek ASIO, ASIO4All and Generic Low Latency ASIO Driver, are know to be incompatible with
Cakewalk and can lead to instability or crashes. If an incompatible ASIO driver is detected, Cakewalk will offer to switch the driver
mode to WASAPI Shared.

Note: This warning does not prevent you from using these drivers. If you need to use them for some reason, you can still select
and use them.

Improved input/output port naming for hardware and software ports
In Cakewalk, all ports are grouped into stereo pairs of channels. In order to make it easier to associate these pairs with the physical
channels exposed by the hardware or virtual instrument, the port naming conventions have been improved as follows:

 Audio and soft synth input and output ports now include a channel number prefix before the port name (prefixes are not shown in
port names when using friendly driver names).

 Port names now always show the actual names of the referenced channels (previously, only the first channel name was shown).
Since many instruments have different names for channels or even dynamic names, the channel index can be used to identify a
specific instrument output more easily.

 When using user defined device names (select Use Friendly Names to Represent Audio Drivers in Edit > Preferences >
Audio - Devices) you can now specify both the left and right channels in the stereo pair by using the vertical bar symbol “|” to
delimit the channel names. For example, entering a friendly name of “Guitar|Voice” may show 1: Guitar, 2: Voice, 1+2: Guitar +
Voice in the menus.

 Input/output prefixes are not shown in port names when using friendly driver names.
 Port names have been shortened to skip the device vendor name for greater legibility in the Track view, Console view and
Inspector. The tooltip for the name shows the full name.

 Port names are no longer compacted. With the smarter port naming, in most cases there should be no need to use friendly names
to shorten the strings, unless you wish to use instrument names for the ports.

 Edit Filter values and MIDI channels are no longer compacted, which makes it easier to read parameter names in most cases.
 In the Console view’s Hardware Outs section, hardware out names now show channel indexes as well as channel names in ASIO
mode.

 Sends now show shortened port names and use port numbering when applicable.

Improved dropout management
In version 2019.09 we introduced Dropout Analytics to allow diagnosing and resolving common causes of audio dropouts. While
dropout messages may be useful to diagnose the cause of problems, they can be intrusive to workflow when small audio
interruptions are inconsequential, such as when editing projects, loading and saving sessions, etc.
Cakewalk now manages dropouts more intelligently by masking certain categories of dropout notifications when they are less
important. The following dropout codes are considered maskable since they are caused by CPU load issues, while other dropouts
are caused by system events that cannot be resumed from easily:

 Dropout code 1: Audio processing took longer than the buffers allotted time slice.
 Dropout code 3: Driver did not request audio buffers for over DropoutMsec milliseconds. Possible driver overload.
Dropouts are masked in the following scenarios:

 The application is idling (transport is not running)
 Performing various editing operations
 Performing real time bounce/export/freeze (rendered data will be free of glitches even if the audio playback contains glitches, as
long as you are not rendering external hardware inserts)

 Playing back using the Play List view
 Opening and closing views
 Opening and closing documents
 Operating screen sets
 Mix Recall
Handling dropouts during playback and recording
Under normal conditions, Cakewalk always stops playback or recording if too many late buffers are encountered while playing.
However there may be circumstances where a dropout that stops playback is disruptive, such as when doing an unattended
recording or playing back in a live scenario.
To handle these cases, a new MaskDropoutDetection option in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Configuration File can be used
to suppress dropouts.

Setting this value to True will activate dropout masking during playback and recording.

New features
Improved dropout management

75

When activated, Cakewalk will continue playback and recording after it encounters a maskable dropout. This can prevent unwanted
interruption of playback or a lost take while recording.

Note:
• If the dropouts are extreme, recorded audio may contain glitches. Please follow the normal dropout diagnosis procedure for
minimizing dropouts.
• The Play List view will always ignore dropouts irrespective of this setting.
• Only CPU load related dropouts are masked. Other dropouts such as driver requested stops or disk underruns will still cause
playback to stop.

Integrated BandLab library access

The 2021.04 release introduces a major update to BandLab integration, with support for downloads and uploads and tracking
revision state directly from within Cakewalk. Subsequent uploads to BandLab of a modified project are automatically tracked as
revisions to the parent project. There is also support for importing clips and MIDI tracks from BandLab projects. The brand new
Library view (File > Browse BandLab Projects) now allows you to navigate your projects on BandLab and set revision and song
properties directly from within Cakewalk.
Here are some of the benefits of BandLab library integration in Cakewalk:

 Easily publish Cakewalk projects, stems and mixes to your BandLab library
 Quickly open BandLab projects in Cakewalk
 Collaborate easily by sharing audio tracks via the BandLab cloud
 Bring projects started on mobile into Cakewalk for VST effects and advanced editing
 Fly in vocals or other parts for a Cakewalk project from iOS and Android
 Curate your music as playlists that you can play anywhere from your mobile device
To publish the current project to your BandLab library, select File > Publish to BandLab or choose Export > BandLab from the
export module on the toolbar.
When publishing to BandLab, a project can be uploaded as a new project, or as a revision to an existing BandLab project.
Use the Upload Settings to pick the combination of project assets you wish to upload to the BandLab project. Tracks and buses are
mixed down prior to uploading to BandLab.

To open a BandLab project, select File > Browse BandLab Projects. You may open as a new Cakewalk project or import into an
existing project. Note that revisions are only tracked if you open as a new Cakewalk project. Use the Download Settings options to
select the types of assets from the BandLab project you wish to download and open.

Tempo track and Tempo Inspector
Figure 3.

Tempo track.

The Tempo track replaces the Tempo view and provides an overview of the project tempo. It allows you to create and edit tempo
changes within a project.
Every project has a tempo, which is expressed in beats per minute (BPM). You can set the tempo in the Transport module, Tempo
track, or Tempo inspector. A project can have a single static tempo, or a tempo map that changes over time.
A tempo map is simply the complete set of all tempo changes in a project. These changes are displayed as an envelope in the
Tempo track, and as a list in the Tempo Inspector (see “Tempo Inspector” on page 85).
In the Tempo track, tempo changes are represented by envelope shapes. You edit the project’s tempo map the same way you edit
automation envelopes. If a project has a single fixed tempo, the Tempo track shows a straight horizontal line. You create tempo
changes by adding envelope nodes and editing their values. You can expand the Tempo track to give yourself more room to work,
and adjust the range of values for the Tempo track.

Showing the Tempo track
The Tempo track resides between the Clips pane and time ruler.
To show the Tempo track, do one of the following:

 Click the Track view View menu and select Tempo Track Show/Hide
 Press ATL+T
 Select Views > Tempo or press ALT+SHIFT+5 (this also opens the Tempo Inspector)

Tip: You can show/hide the Tempo track with the assignable Show/Hide Tempo Track global key binding. For details, see “Key
bindings” on page 1261.
Cakewalk also includes a workspace named Tempo that configures the layout for tempo editing. For details, see “Workspaces” on

PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier ProChannel module
Figure 6.

PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier.

PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier is an audio processing module for the ProChannel channel strip in Cakewalk.
PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier is meticulously modeled after a legendary vintage electro-optical tube compressor. This
compressor, known for its automatic gain control characteristics, delivers vintage sound with incredibly warm and rich compression.
It is revered by audio engineers worldwide for its trademark sound, and has been used on countless hit records since the late 1960s.
It is one of the true classics in the audio recording industry.
The purpose of PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier is to limit the dynamic range of a signal by reducing the amplitude of its transient
peaks. PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier varies its gain in response to the level of the input signal. Large input signals result in less
gain, thus reducing or “compressing” the dynamic range of the signal.
For details, see “PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier” on page 1105, or give focus to the PC2A module and press F1.

Optimizations
High resolution plug-in automation improvements
Plug-in automation envelopes were previously being decimated at a uniform 50 msec interval. The automation rendering process
has been redesigned to render at a much higher resolution (default = 5 msec) and also make automation sample accurate for VST3
plug-ins. For VST2, or VST3 plug-ins that do not support sample accurate automation, the rendering will be buffer accurate.
These improvements allow for much tighter sync when automating plug-in parameters synced to rhythm even at higher latencies.
The higher resolution rendering also makes automating filter sweeps audibly smoother and without aliasing artifacts. The decimation
interval can be changed via the audio configuration property AutomationDecimationMsec (2-30) in Edit > Preferences > Audio
- Configuration File.

Windows 10 high DPI rendering option (experimental feature)

Note: This feature is experimental, so please report back if you notice any improvements or problems when using it.
This feature will only benefit users with high DPI displays such as 4K monitors, and may not be noticeable unless your Windows
display scaling setting is > 100%.
Cakewalk 2021.04 introduces a new experimental Cakewalk.ini variable that enables improved high DPI rendering on Windows
10 build 1809 (October 2018) and above.
When enabled, the rendering quality of text and other GDI-based primitives automatically improve when the window is displayed on
a high-DPI monitor. All Cakewalk UI is potentially affected, including menus and dialogs, but plug-in windows are created without
high DPI rendering improvements to avoid UI issues.
To enable Windows 10 DPI awareness, add the following variable in Cakewalk.ini (Edit > Preferences > File - Initialization
File):
EnableWin10DPIAwareness=1
To disable again, set the variable to EnableWin10DPIAwareness=0.

Plug-in menu improvements
Plug-in menus have been greatly enhanced to make it easier and faster to find and select plug-ins:

 Plug-in menus show color coded plug-in types (DX/VST2/VST3/32 bit)
 Large plug-in menus can now show over 1,000 plug-ins
 Multiple columns appear when applicable
 Clearer fonts
 Supports mouse wheel scrolling
 Supports keyboard navigation:
 HOME / END
 PAGE UP / PAGE DOWN
 Press any alpha-numeric key to go to the first plug-in beginning with that character; press the same character again to go to
the next plug-in, etc.

Track Manager preset support
The Track Manager dialog box now has support for per-project presets.
This is useful if you have a large project and you want to hide all other tracks apart from a certain group of tracks. For example, on a
rock project you could have a “Drums only” or “Guitars” preset; on an orchestral project, you may wish to have a “Strings Section”
preset that hides all tracks apart from your strings tracks.

To open the Track Manager, click the Track view Tracks menu and select Track Manager or press the H key.

Note: Tracks within the Tracks Manager presets are “opted-out” - i.e. it remembers which tracks you want to hide, rather than
which tracks you want to show (to avoid not being able to see newly created tracks).

UI theme compatibility checker
When you select a theme in Edit > Preferences > Customization - Themes, or launch Cakewalk with an old custom user theme
active, Cakewalk checks to make sure the custom theme is compatible with the current version of Cakewalk.
A user theme is considered incompatible if Cakewalk contains new or resized UI elements that have not been updated in the theme.
If the selected theme needs to be updated, Cakewalk will show a Custom Theme Incompatibility warning, and ask if you want to
continue to use the theme:

 If you click Yes, some UI elements might be corrupted until the theme is updated and resaved in Theme Editor.
 If you click No, Cakewalk will revert to the factory Mercury theme.

Improved plug-in exception handling / crash reporting

Note: Plug-in crashes should always be first reported to the manufacturer's support channels to allow them to diagnose these
issues.
There are several improvements to error reporting to help diagnose plug-in or application crashes:

 Cakewalk now distinguishes between plug-in and application crashes and will list the plug-in name where available in the crash
dialog.

 For easier reporting, the crash dump file when generated is now displayed as a hyperlink allowing you to click to open the location
of the file.

 The application also intercepts and reports errors that would previously result in the application silently shutting down. You will
now get a dump file where possible and the ability to save your current work in these scenarios.

Additionally, when applicable, the crash dialog allows you to continue after a crash. Please note that the behavior after resuming is
not guaranteed and is provided as a last resort to access project information when a crash occurs. It should only be used in cases
where the crash is known to be continuable.
To specify the error detection sensitivity, add the following variable in Cakewalk.ini (Edit > Preferences > File - Initialization
File):
ExceptionHandlingSeverity=<value>
Valid values for this setting are:
1 = Unhandled errors are caught (default)
3 = All access violations are detected and unhandled exceptions are caught
5 = Unhandled errors and heap corruption is detected
7 = Unhandled errors, all access violations and heap corruption errors are caught (this is the strictest error detection mode)
As of 2021.01 Update 1, we have dialed back the default error sensitivity to 1, since a few plug-ins were preventing projects from
loading. The sensitivity value defaults to 1 but can changed to 7 make it catch even more plug-in errors.
To revert to the default value, delete the ExceptionHandlingSeverity variable.

Arranger section inclusion of outlying MIDI notes
When dragging sections or committing arrangements, Cakewalk has logic for dealing with leading/trailing MIDI notes that overlap
section boundaries.
In the following example, section 2 is selected. The underlying MIDI clip contains note events that start slightly before section 2 and
end slightly after section 2. By default, selecting section 2 will ignore the portions of overlapping note events that fall outside the
section boundaries. Cakewalk now lets you optionally include the full duration of overlapping note events.

A
A. Notes that overlap section boundaries

Leading/trailing notes are often created in the following scenarios:

 The recorded performance is unquantized and notes appear slightly earlier than the section start.
 When using a sound with a slow attack, and the notes have to be played early to make up for the attack time.
 Leading notes as part of a lead-in phrase, or droned notes that overlap with the section boundaries.
You can specify the threshold that determines which overlapping note events are included when moving sections.
To do so, click the Track view MIDI menu and point to Arranger Section Event Overlap Threshold, then select one of the following
options:

 Off. Ignore overlapping notes.
 Note value (Whole – 1/256 Triplet). Only include notes that overhang by a duration equal to or less than the selected value.
 Any Overlap. Include notes that overhang by any duration.
When overlapping notes fall within the threshold set, those notes are included in the section move/copy and the clip start/end is
automatically resized (slip-edited) to accommodate the notes. The moved notes are also removed from the neighboring sections.
This requires Non-destructive Editing to be enabled, and works best with Split MIDI Note enabled.
The Arranger Section Event Overlap Threshold setting affects all arranger drag operations, delete, commit arrangement, and
Duplicate from the section context menu.

Absolute time in Arranger tracks
The time base format for each Arranger track can be set to either Musical or Absolute. The time base format determines what
happens to sections when you change the project tempo.
To toggle between musical and absolute time, click the icon to the left of the Arranger track name in the Track view:

 Musical

.

A section’s M:B:T position stays constant, and its absolute position shifts.

 Absolute

When committing an arrangement, the following rules apply:

 If all the sections came from absolute time Arranger tracks, the committed arrangement track will be absolute.
 If the sections came from musical Arranger tracks (or a mixture of musical/absolute), the committed arrangement track will be
musical.

SSO (Single Sign-On) for Cakewalk activation
Cakewalk supports SSO (Single Sign-On) for activation, which allows you to log in via any service supported by BandLab as your
sign-in authority. Google, Facebook, Apple ID, mobile phone and BandLab user/password credentials are currently supported.
SSO is only used for Cakewalk activation, and under normal circumstances you will only need to sign in once. Cakewalk will attempt
to refresh your activation status silently and automatically on occasion during start up. Use the SSO login as you have done with
your BandLab account in the past.
This feature replaces the previous user name / password dialog and deprecates the requirement to use BandLab Assistant for
Cakewalk activation. However, BandLab Assistant is still required for requesting offline activation of Cakewalk on computers that
don’t have an Internet connection.

Optimizations
Dynamic plug-in parameter optimizations
Cakewalk 2021.01 introduces improvements in responsiveness and memory footprint when loading and editing projects with lots of
tracks and high parameter count plug-ins. In previous versions of Cakewalk, plug-in automation parameters for all listed plug-ins
were always created up front. This could result in a significant performance and memory hit when using plug-ins that expose
hundreds or thousands of parameters, especially in projects that contain many tracks.
Internal parameter objects are now created on demand when a parameter is actually used, either by modifying a parameter or by
creating an automation envelope for it. A track’s Edit Filter menu no longer lists hundreds of parameters for plug-ins but instead only
shows in-use parameters. To select other parameters in the Edit Filter menu, point to the plug-in name and select Choose
Parameter to open the Choose Plug-in Parameter dialog box.
The following areas are impacted by these changes:

 Edit Filter track/bus/clip automation menus show the Choose Parameter
 Reassign envelope
 FX Chain menus in track/bus/clips and ProChannel
 Parameter assignment menus in FX Chain editor
 Project load and save
 Envelope persistence
 Track and effect creation and deletion

Improved handling of ProChannel automation
Automating the ProChannel Enable parameter would previously only work if the ProChannel UI was visible. ProChannel bypass
automation is now UI independent and also buffer accurate. ProChannel bypass will also properly enable/disable with automation
during fast bounce and freeze operations.

Insert Instrument track behavior
When selected from the track context menu, the Insert Instrument command now inserts the instrument before the current track
rather than after the last track. The Add Track button and Insert > Soft Synth command will continue to append after the last track.
Similarly, the Append Instrument Track command in the track context menu will append the new per-output instrument track
directly below the current track. Selecting Append Instrument Track from the Synth Rack context menu will continue to append
after the last track.

Option to only use external MIDI inputs
MIDI track’s that have their Input control assigned to All Inputs receive MIDI data from both external (i.e. hardware) inputs and any
soft synth outputs from other tracks.
When inserting a soft synth, Cakewalk defaults to enabling MIDI output if it is supported by the synth. As a result, MIDI output from
Instrument tracks may be inadvertently played/recorded on all other MIDI tracks if the tracks are armed for recording or have MIDI
Input Echo enabled.
To address this, MIDI tracks now have a new All External Inputs input option, which only appears when at least one soft synth with
a MIDI output is present in the project. All External Inputs means any MIDI input that isn’t an output from a soft synth, such as
hardware MIDI ports and virtual controllers.
In earlier versions, switching the active MIDI track would normally select All Inputs. This behavior has changed to:

 If the track previously included soft synth outputs in its inputs, then it will show as All Inputs.
 If the track previously only had hardware inputs, then it will show as All External Inputs.
See:
“Choosing an input” on page 353

Export to Standard MIDI File respects selection
Export to Standard MIDI File (File > Export > Standard MIDI File) now respects the selection. If there is no selection, the whole
project is exported.
See:
“MIDI files, projects, tracks, and clips” on page 224

Updated LAME MP3 encoder
The integrated LAME MP3 encoder has been updated to version 3.100. This includes bug fixes and stability improvements to MP3
encoding and also speeds up the encoding process. Additionally, Cakewalk has been updated to now handle discarding padding
samples when importing MP3 files. i.e imported MP files will not contain extra data at the beginning of the file.
See:
“To export a project in MP3 format” on page 1145

Updated libsndfile encoders
The libsndfile library used for import and export of various audio formats has been updated to version 1.0.30. This fixes numerous
issues with handling BWF, Wave64, AIFF, FLAC and Ogg files.

Articulation Maps

Articulation maps are a universal way to deal with expressions/articulations in VST instruments or hardware MIDI instruments that
may be controlled by various methods including:

 Note “key switches”
 The velocity of a note
 Control change events
 Grouping of patches across different MIDI channels (e.g. legato strings patch on ch 1, pizzicato patch on ch 2, etc.)
If you work with sample libraries and virtual instruments, articulation maps are sure to improve your MIDI and articulation/keyswitch
workflow.
Recreating a convincing performance with sample libraries and virtual instruments can be a difficult task. The process is made
somewhat easier if the sampled instrument includes a range of performance articulations, which is commonly controlled via
“keyswitches”. These are used to trigger different sample layers that contain the various performance options. Cakewalk's support
for articulation maps make it easy to work with articulations and keyswitches.
Articulation maps provide a much simpler way of switching articulations, without having to manually edit MIDI events in the track. All
articulations appear neatly at the top of the Piano Roll view instead of spread across the Notes pane, which helps you to better
visualize and edit the articulations and keyswitches.
When recording, you can focus on the actual performance — getting the right notes, rather than building expression into the
performance — then use articulations to add expression after the basic performance has been recorded. Adding articulations as part
of the editing process is often easier than trying to play keyswitches in live via your keyboard.
Articulations do either, or both, of the following:

 Trigger new MIDI events (Generate New MIDI Events in the Articulation Map Editor)
 Alter existing MIDI events (Transform Existing MIDI Events in the Articulation Map Editor)
Articulations that are added to MIDI and Instrument tracks are automatically applied during playback.
An Articulation map is a collection of up to 255 articulations, normally associated with a single VSTi or sample library. Each
articulation has a collection of MIDI Events to send out and/or a collection MIDI Transforms to apply to existing MIDI data.
Cakewalk includes a few general-purpose articulation maps that let you experiment with the feature. You can create your own
articulation maps, or download maps for orchestra libraries and virtual instruments.
Cakewalk can import Cubase expression maps, so you can get started quickly by downloading maps for popular instrument libraries
such as Vienna Symphonic Library, Garritan, Kontakt, etc. See “Importing articulation maps” on page 903.

In-app activation/refresh
You can now activate Cakewalk directly from within the app, without requiring BandLab Assistant. Cakewalk must be activate once
every 6 months.
When starting Cakewalk for the first time, if the app has not yet been activated via BandLab assistant, you will be presented with a
BandLab sign-in dialog box. After signing in, Cakewalk will automatically activate itself. If you do not have your BandLab username
and password, please use BandLab Assistant to perform activation.
Activation will occur automatically when launching the app if it is in the “grace period”, the period that begins when you see the
timeout toast notification asking you to sign in to BandLab to activate soon.
Under normal circumstances, activation will require no manual user intervention going forward, beyond the initial sign-in.
Note that an Internet connection is required for performing activation as described above but not required for general Cakewalk
usage. Offline activation is also an option, which requires use of BandLab Assistant to submit an offline activation request (see
“Offline activation” on page 137).
You can force an activation refresh with the Help > Refresh Activation command.

VST instruments can use custom instrument definitions
Some VST instruments do not expose their patch list, either because they are emulating a hardware device and solely rely on MIDI
bank select/program changes, or in the case of library hosts such as Kontakt, they have no fixed list of instruments - in other words
its up to the user to choose their instrument mapping.
You can now assign any instrument definition to a VSTi from a new drop-down menu in the Patch Browser dialog box (click Patch
Browser in the Inspector).
If < default for instrument > is selected, then the patches are retrieved from the VSTi as normal, otherwise the patch list is taken
from the selected instrument definition.

Misc. enhancements
Application memory footprint has been reduced (dynamic VST Plug-in Buffer sizes)
In prior versions of Cakewalk, cached plug-in buffers would be allocated at a size of 32K samples irrespective of the audio buffer
size. This gets quite expensive when you have a project with hundreds of plug-ins, especially with plug-ins that have multiple inputs
and outputs.
Plug-in buffer sizes are now dynamically adjusted to be based on the audio buffer size rather than an arbitrary max limit. This makes
a big difference especially in projects running at low latency buffers.

Support for mono only ASIO input devices
Cakewalk now supports ASIO devices with a single mono input, such as the iRig Pro.

Resize selected tracks relatively
You can resize all selected tracks to the same size, or by a relative amount, by using the following modifiers:

 SHIFT+drag resizes all selected tracks to the same size
 CTRL+drag resizes all selected tracks by the same amount relative to their current size
ARA updates
Cakewalk supports the latest ARA SDK from Celemony.

Adjust split point on a single Take lane
If you have several clips in a track with a common split point, the Move Split Point tool always moves all the split points together.
To move only the split point on a single lane, hold down the ALT key when using the Move Split Point tool.

CTRL-click Duplicate Track button to specify settings
To specify settings when duplicating a track, hold down the CTRL key and click the Duplicate Track button

.

Allow track FX bin to be bypassed via control surfaces rather than just individual FX
In addition to individual effects, entire track FX Racks can now be bypassed via control surfaces.
Passing an FX index of -1 (65535) will bypass the entire track FX Rack.
The Mackie Control surface has been updated to use M1+Select button to toggle track FX Rack bypass.

Update installer has option to launch Cakewalk
When installing an update from within Cakewalk (see “In-app updater” on page 110), you can now choose to automatically relaunch
Cakewalk after the installation completes.

Multiple Arranger tracks
A project can contain multiple Arranger tracks, with each track containing its own set of sections.Multiple Arranger tracks provides
many benefits, including:

 Simultaneously declare multiple sections intersecting within a given range of time.
 Define and organize sub-sections within a larger section. For example, if you have a live recording of multiple songs, you can use
one Arranger track to mark out each song, and another to mark out the verses and choruses within each song.

 Use multiple sections for generic annotation within a project.
Arrangements are not tied to a specific Arranger track, and can contain sections from different Arranger tracks. In the Arranger
Inspector, the tooltip indicates a section's parent Arranger track.
There's no limit to the number of Arranger tracks you can create, but only 8 can be visible at once. To hide an Arranger track, right

 Ripple Edit All affects sections in all Arranger tracks.
 The Cut Special, Copy Special, and Delete Special commands provide the option to include sections from only the active
Arranger track, or from all Arranger tracks.

Section operation behaviors
Each Arranger track acts completely separately from one another, so section operations in one Arranger track will not affect other
Arranger tracks. For example:

 Section Move/Copy/Swap operations does not affect sections in other Arranger tracks
 Moving sections between tracks does not affect clips
There are three exceptions:

 Using Delete when Ripple Edit All in enabled
 Using Project > Insert Time/Measures

Arranger section types
Arranger sections can be assigned to an optional section type attribute, such as Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc. Cakewalk includes
many common section types, and you can create your own custom section type presets (see “To create a new section type preset”
on page 117).
Section types provide the following benefits:

 By tagging sections with type attributes, you can use Arranger templates (see “Arranger templates” on page 122) to instantly
create new arrangements from your existing sections (see “To create a new arrangement from an Arranger template” on page
123).

 Quickly assign consistent names and colors to sections that serve specific musical functions in a song.
 Directly insert new sections that automatically use appropriate names and colors.

To assign a section type to a section
Right-click a section in the Arranger track or Arranger Inspector, point to Section Type, and select the desired section type.
The section inherits the name and color from the section type preset.
When a section is assigned to a type, the type abbreviation is shown in the top right corner of the section. This serves as a visual
aide to help you identify which sections have been assigned to a type.

Note: If you have previously given the section a custom name, the original name is retained after assigning a section type. If
you want to use the default style name, clear the current section name via the Rename command. A blank name will
automatically use the stored style name. Should you want to use a blank section name, simply use a single space character as
the name.

Arranger templates
Arranger templates are pre-defined song forms that store the order in which sections are arranged. You can think of an Arranger
template as a map of an entire song.
Arranger templates are global and can be used in several ways:

 Create a new Arranger track from a template. The template is applied to the Arranger track, which creates new sections. This
is useful when starting a new song and you want to quickly create all Arranger sections for a typical song form that you can fill in
with music.

 Insert sections in an existing Arranger track. Drag Arranger templates from the Media Browser and drop them in existing
Arranger tracks. Sections in the template are inserted into the target track.

 Create a new arrangement. If your project already contains existing sections, you can use Arranger templates to create new
arrangements from the existing sections. This allows you to preview your existing sections with different song forms. Sections that
exist in the template but not in the project can be optionally created at the end of the project in the active Arranger track.
Arranger templates store the following information:

 Section order
 Section types
 Section names
 Section durations
 Section colors
Cakewalk includes many common Arranger templates, and you can create your own custom templates that can be used in any
project. Arranger templates can be created from an existing Arranger track or from an existing arrangement.
Arranger templates can be found in the Media Browser under Arranger Templates.

[Optional] To get the most benefit from Arranger templates, assign a section type to each section (see “To assign a section type
to a section” on page 116). This will allow templates to map their saved sections to existing sections.
2. Do one of the following:

 In the Arranger Inspector, click the Sections menu and select Save as Arranger Template.
 In the Track view, right-click the Arranger track name and select Save as Arranger Template.
Note: Gaps between sections are not saved in Arranger templates.

To save an arrangement as a template
1. In the Arranger Inspector’s Arrangements list, arrange sections in the desired order.
2. Click the Arrangements menu and select Save as Arranger Template.

To create a new Arranger track from a template
To create a new Arranger track from an Arranger template, do one of the following:

 In the Arranger Inspector, click the Sections menu and select New Arranger Track from Template.

 In the Media Browser, select the Arranger Templates content location preset, and do one of the following:
 Drag a template (.arr file) to the Arranger Inspector’s Sections area.
 Drag a template (.arr file) to the Track view Arranger track header area.
 Hold down the ALT key and double-click a template (.arr file).
Cakewalk creates a new Arranger track containing sections from the template.

Note: Only 8 Arranger tracks can be shown simultaneously. If 8 Arranger tracks are already visible, you must first hide at least
one track before you can create a new Arranger track.

Tip: The Arranger workspace is configured to show the Arranger Templates folder in the Media Browser. For details about using
Workspaces, see “Workspaces” on page 745.

To insert a template into an existing Arranger track

content location preset, then do one of the following:

 Drag a template (.arr file) to the target Arranger track timeline.
 Double-click a template (.arr file) to insert at the Now Time in the active Arranger track.
To create a new arrangement from an Arranger template
To create a new arrangement from an Arranger template, do one of the following:

 In the Arranger Inspector, click the Arrangements menu and select New Arrangement from Template.
 In the Media Browser, select the Arranger Templates content location preset, and do one of the following:
 Drag a template (.arr file) to the Arranger Inspector’s Arrangements area.
 Hold down ALT+SHIFT and double-click a template (.arr file).
Cakewalk will try to match the sections in the project with the types specified within the template, and create a new arrangement
from them.

New features
Arranger templates

123

Note: When creating a new arrangement from a template, Cakewalk attempts to automatically map sections that are stored in
the template to sections that already exist in the project. The mapping is based on section names and types.
If the template contains types that don't exist in the project, it will try to find a section with the same name as that type. If there is no
match, you will have the option of creating new blank sections of that type in the active Arranger track, or simply skipping sections of
that type.

Deleting Arranger templates
To delete an Arranger template, do one of the following:

 In the Media Browser, select the Arranger Templates content location preset, then right-click the template you want to delete and
select Delete.

 In Windows Explorer, navigate to C:\Cakewalk Content\Cakewalk Core\Arranger Templates and delete the desired
Arranger template (.arr) file.

Arranger template location and naming convention
Cakewalk includes many Arranger templates that are based on common song forms such as AB, AABA, ABC, etc., where A
typically refers to the Verse, B refers to the Chorus, and C refers to the Bridge.
By default, Arranger templates are stored in C:\Cakewalk Content\Cakewalk Core\Arranger Templates. The folder
location can be specified in Edit > Preferences > File - Folder Locations under Arranger Templates.
The Media Browser also has an Arranger Templates content location preset that points to C:\Cakewalk Content\Cakewalk
Core\Arranger Templates.

Enhanced ‘Instrument Track Per Audio Output’
When inserting a multi-timbral soft synth, you can use the Instrument Track Per Output option in the Add Track menu and Insert
Soft Synth Options dialog box to specify how many Instrument tracks to create. This allows you to have multiple Instrument tracks
for a single instance of a synth.
However, if you specify more output tracks than the synth supports, Cakewalk will now create additional synth instances as required.
For example, adding 16 TTS-1 tracks will create 4 TTS-1 instances as the TTS-1 supports 4 audio outs per instance.

Classic Creative Suite audio effects
The Classic Creative Suite is made up of powerful and easy to use Cakewalk effects including Alias Factor, Classic Phaser,
Compressor/Gate, HF Exciter, Modfilter, Multivoice Chorus/Flanger, Para-Q, and Tempo Delay.
For more information about each plug-in, open a plug-in and press F1 to access its online Help.

Alias Factor
Figure 22.

Alias Factor.

Alias Factor combines bit crushing and low pass filtering in a unique way, allowing you to decimate your audio to create tones as
varied as vintage samplers, cell phones, or old video games. Decimator effects are nothing new, but Alias Factor generates this
effect using a special technique that generates aliasing without the unwanted harsh effects provided by other options, offering
sounds that are grainy in a “smooth” and organic way. Alias Factor also allows for further creation of attention grabbing new timbres
by linking a low pass resonant filter to the decimator for a new means of tweaking your sound.

Classic Phaser
Figure 23.

Classic Phaser.

This is a classic phaser effect that uses a modulating notch filter with a feedback loop. The “Quadra” mode provides extra wide
imaging and animation.

Compressor/Gate
Figure 24.

Stereo Compressor/Gate.

Stereo Compressor/Gate combines a compressor and a gate into a single effect, so you can increase the overall dynamic level of an
audio signal, without distorting the loud parts, and without excessively boosting low-level noise. You can manually trigger the gate
via MIDI, which makes it simple to produce stuttering effects.

HF Exciter
Figure 25.

HF Exciter.

HF Exciter lets you enhance the higher end of the frequency spectrum. This produces the psycho-acoustic affect that the signal is
brighter and clearer. This is done by adding harmonic content that is not present in the original signal.

New features
Classic Creative Suite audio effects

129

Modfilter
Figure 26.

Mod Filter.

Mod Filter produces a dynamic filtering effect, in that the actual filter can respond to incoming signal or follow the cycle of a temposynchronized LFO. The filter itself is a low-pass filter type, which filters out higher frequencies.

Multivoice Chorus/Flanger
Figure 27.

Multivoice Chorus/Flanger.

Chorus/Flanger lets you add depth and thickness to the signal. The EQ section in the feedback path allows you to create some truly
unique sounds.

Para-Q
Figure 28.

Para-Q.

Para-Q is a two-band true parametric EQ that can be used to boost or attenuate generally high or low bands of the signal. It
consumes very little processing power, which allows you to use it on many tracks simultaneously.

Tempo Delay
Figure 29.

Tempo Delay.

Stereo Delay produces a tempo-synchronized echo on whichever channel it is patched to. The three-band EQ section in the
feedback path allows you to create some truly unique sounds.

Improved handling of temporary removal of control surfaces
Cakewalk now better handles the temporary removal of devices related to connected/configured control surfaces.
If the MIDI input or output ports are not available, the control surface is now disabled. The control surface name will be shown in
parentheses and any missing ports will be shown as -- None --.
Regardless of whether MIDI ports have been remapped or not as a result of adding or removing MIDI devices, only user changes to
the control surface setup will be saved. Unchanged control surfaces will retain their original settings. Therefore, if a MIDI port is
unavailable and the ports are shown as -- None --, as long as this surface is left unchanged, it will automatically restore its previous
settings the next time Cakewalk is restarted with the MIDI device available.
See:
“MIDI - Control Surfaces” on page 1680

ALT+drag in time ruler to select both tracks and buses
By default, making a time selection by dragging in the time ruler only selects tracks. To select both tracks and buses, hold down the

‘Split MIDI Notes’ and ‘Non-Destructive MIDI Editing’ options in MIDI menu
The Non-Destructive MIDI Editing and Split MIDI Notes options that are found in the Edit > Preferences > Customization Editing dialog box impact Arranger track editing, so we have made them more accessible by also adding them to the Track view
MIDI menu:

 Non-Destructive MIDI Editing. Select this option to make all MIDI editing non-destructive. When toggled on, this option forces
deleted data to be retained even though it is not visible.

 When you split or crop clips, the old MIDI events are still there but they're hidden. So you can extend the ends of the clips to
reveal the MIDI events again. If this is turned off, you lose those events when you split. In most cases you should leave this
option enabled.

 Split MIDI Notes. Select this option to split any underlying MIDI notes when you split clips, and insert MIDI chase events (such
as continuous controllers, Pitch Wheel, and Patch Change) at the split position.

 The advantage of this is that you don’t get lost notes when copy/pasting or cut/pasting notes that start just before the split
point.

 The disadvantage of this is that if you extend the clip ends, as the note has now been split, it will be retriggered at the split
point.
The menu commands are also available as key bindings. You can assign the key binding in Edit > Preferences > Customization Keyboard Shortcuts (under Area: Track View).

Add Track menu now supports plug-in layouts
The Add Track window’s menu now supports the use of plug-in layouts. The Plug-in Browser and Add Track menu display the same

Dynamic waveform scaling when changing clip automation

When Display Clip Fade/Envelope Attenuation is enabled in Edit > Preferences > Customization - Display, Cakewalk
dynamically updates the waveform amplitude when changing clip fades, clip gain automation and clip pan automation.
The waveform display is pre clip FX Rack and only applies to clip automation, not track automation. Additionally, clip gain and pan
envelopes are not applied to active Region FX clips. i.e. If you have a clip gain envelope on a Region FX clip, it will be ignored unless
the effect is bypassed.
The Display Clip Fade/Envelope Attenuation option is now also available as a key binding in Edit > Preferences >
Customization - Keyboard Shortcuts (under Area: Track View).

Offline activation
Activation is the process by which Cakewalk validates that your software is genuine and being used in accordance with the license
agreement. Cakewalk can be activated by an online or offline process.
Saving and exporting are disabled until Cakewalk is activated.
A toast notification appears at the bottom of the screen to inform you if Cakewalk has not been activated yet. If your computer is
connected to the internet, click the toast notification to open BandLab Assistant and activate Cakewalk.
If Cakewalk is installed on a computer that is not connected to the internet, you can use offline activation as long as you have access
to another computer that is connected to the internet.

To use offline activation
1. In Cakewalk, go to Help > Offline Activation > Export Activation Request to open the Save activation request dialog box.
2. Select the folder you want to save the activation request file to, then click Save.
Cakewalk saves a Activation request.crq file. This file is encrypted and machine-specific, and can only be used to
activate Cakewalk on the machine that was originally used to create the Activation request.crq file.
By default, Cakewalk appends a timestamp to the file name, using the following format:
<Month><Day><Year>_<Hour><Minute>. For example: 032820_1157Activation request.crq.
3. Copy the Activation request.crq file to removable media, such as a USB flash drive, that you can transfer to another
computer that is connected to the internet.
4. Using an online computer, open BandLab Assistant and sign in with your BandLab ID and password.
5. Click the Apps tab.
6. Under Cakewalk by BandLab, click the drop-down arrow next to the Open button, then click Process Offline Activation
Request.
If activation is granted, BandLab Assistant generates a Activation response.dat file.
7. Copy the Activation response.dat file to removable media that you can transfer back to your offline Cakewalk computer.
8. In Cakewalk, go to Help > Offline Activation > Import Activation Response to open the Import activation response dialog
box.
9. Select the Activation response.dat file and click Open.

Mono plug-in support changes
This release greatly improves the FX Rack handling with respect to mixing and matching mono/stereo plug-ins. These
improvements are across the board and work in track/bus/clip FX Racks, FX chains and the ProChannel.

 Bypassing or removing plug-ins in an FX Rack, Rack bypass or global FX bypass operations will now revert any mono/stereo
interleave changes caused by the plug-in, and recalculate delay compensation properly.

 Changing the mono/stereo interleave from the track strip button now updates the FX Rack routing correctly (Note: this is
dependent on whether the ProChannel bin is pre FX Rack and if it contains mono plug-ins).

 Pitch shifted audio and distortion were symptoms of issues that are fixed in this release. This could occur under multiple
scenarios, such as moving plug-ins, bypassing, deleting or undoing.

Improved mouse wheel handling
 Console view vertical scrolling via mouse wheel is less prone to inadvertently adjusting parameter values if there is a brief pause
during the scroll gesture (for example, while vertically scrolling with the mouse wheel, suddenly it starts scrolling the volume slider
instead). The internal timer that waits for inactivity before treating the next mouse wheel movement as a new operation has been
increased from 500ms to 1,000ms. This ensures that the current scroll operation doesn't change mid-gesture.

 In the Console view, tooltips dynamically show values when changing parameters via mouse wheel.
 FX Racks for tracks, buses and clips can be scrolled via mouse wheel.
See:
“New features” on page 43

Misc. UI enhancements
Increased contrast of ghosted envelopes
The color contrast of ghosted automation envelopes has been increased, making them easier to see against the dark Clips pane
background when Automation Lanes are collapsed.

Clicking on the Bus pane now automatically sets the bus focus strip
This facilitates copying and pasting bus envelopes by clicking and pasting.

Scrollable Clip FX Rack in Inspector
FX Racks in Clip Properties Inspector now display up to 10 plug-ins and are scrollable using both mouse wheel and the scroll bar.

Improved support for recording automation via numeric input
 When recording automation, envelope nodes can now be recorded by typing a value in the pop-up edit controls in the Inspector,
Console view, Track view, ProChannel EQ, and EQ fly-out module. The numeric input will be recorded as a Jump during
automation recording.

 To show the numeric input pop-up, give focus to a control or its value display, then press F2 or double-click the value display.
Improved recording automation of synth parameters
Multiple synth parameters can be recorded in a single record pass and all envelopes are now retained. While loop recording, in order
to avoid clutter, the automation preview only shows the last loop record pass. All recording envelopes will be displayed when you
stop playback.

Improved support for copying and pasting automation envelopes
 Automation envelopes can now be easily copied and pasted from tracks to buses and vice versa. To copy track automation to a
bus, first select and copy the envelope from the track, then click on the target bus or lane and paste. You can also copy and paste
bus automation to tracks the same way.

 Moving or copying arrangement sections now properly manages copying and pasting the associated bus and synth automation
envelopes.

Bus delete stability improvements
Bus deletion can now be performed while the transport is rolling without stopping the audio engine. Also an intermittent crash and
app shutdown on undoing bus deletion has been fixed.

Rename Clip key binding
The Rename Clip command is now available as a key binding in Edit > Preferences > Customization - Keyboard Shortcuts
(under Area: Track View).

Arranger track

The Arranger track is an arrangement tool that provides several workflow benefits:

 Easily rearrange sections of the entire project as one unit instead of moving individual clips. For example, instantly swap the
positions of the first and second chorus for all tracks, or copy the first verse in order to double its duration.

 Experiment with different song structures in a non-destructive and non-linear manner. For example, does your song work best in
AABA, ABAB, or ABAC song form? Define time range sections and sequence them in any order without destructively moving any
clip data. You can even save multiple arrangements within each project.

 Create a color coded overview of the song structure, and use the Arranger Inspector to quickly navigate around the project and
jump to song sections.

 Create arbitrary song sections anywhere on the project timeline, then later string them together for seamless playback.
 Sections provide an additional way to perform time based selections and edits of the project.
 Create an unlimited number of arrangements per project, which can all be exported simultaneously.
Arranger functionality is distributed across two views:

 Arranger track (see “Arranger tracks” on page 441)
 Arranger Inspector (see “Arranger Inspector” on page 448)
For details, see “Arranger tracks” on page 438.

Multi-timbral soft synth enhancements
Instrument Track Per Audio Output
In Cakewalk 2019.11 and earlier, Simple Instrument Tracks are limited to one track per instance of a VSTi, and a single stereo audio
out.
Cakewalk 2020.01 has a new Instrument Track Per Output option in the Add Track menu and Insert Soft Synth Options dialog
box for multi-timbral soft synths that support multiple outputs. It pairs a MIDI track with a separate audio output track (mono or
stereo) for each synth output, assigning sequential MIDI channels. This allows you to have multiple Instrument tracks for a single
instance of a synth.
The Instrument Track Per Output option is similar to the All Synth Audio Outputs: Stereo and All Synth Audio Outputs: Mono
options, except Instrument tracks are created instead of Audio tracks.

CPU metrics in Performance module
Diagnosing glitches in audio playback is now easier with the new Engine Load and Late Buffers metrics in the Control Bar's
Performance module tooltip. To view these new metrics, hover the mouse over the Performance module. Note: you must have
Show Tooltips enabled in Preferences > Customization - Display to see this.
The Engine Load value is a percentage of the total time the engine took to process an audio buffer. If it takes 100% or more of the
allotted time, the buffer is processed too late and it will result in audio glitches/distortion. The value in parenthesis represents the
max engine load since the time the engine started.
Engine load is a better metric to help troubleshoot audio glitches during playback since it accounts for other delays in synchronizing
and processing audio workloads beyond what the CPU meters report. It's normal for engine load to be higher than the average CPU
meter value shown.
The Late Buffers count indicates the total number of buffers that took too long to process since the time the engine started. Too
many late buffers will result in audible glitches or distortion in playback due to the audio device not receiving buffers in time.

Note: It's OK to have a few sporadic late buffers during playback since it will not result in audible glitches.

ASIO improvements

Automatic Dropout Restart behavior
The most common reason for audio dropouts is ASIO device state changes. This dropout is most commonly triggered if you change
latency or sample rate in the ASIO panel.
By default, Cakewalk will now automatically restart the audio engine when certain kinds of benign dropouts are detected. If playback
is underway, the dropout is handled and playback resumes automatically from where it left off. This behavior can be changed in
Preferences > Audio - Configuration File by setting the RestartEngineAfterDropout flag. Set to False to revert to the prior
behavior of displaying a dropout toast notification.

Note: If recording is underway when this happens, you will get a dropout notification as before.

Latency updates from ASIO driver panel are reflected in Cakewalk
In prior Cakewalk versions, changes to the ASIO driver panel were not always reflected in Cakewalk until closing and reopening the
Preferences dialog box.

ASIO latency can be set from Preferences dialog box
For supported audio devices, the latency slider in Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings can now be used to change the audio
buffer size without the need to open the manufacturer’s ASIO panel. For this to work, the driver has to support reporting its latency
metrics to the host and respond to preferred buffer size requests. If supported, you will see a latency slider with the min/max latency
as recommended by the driver. If unsupported, the slider will be disabled.

Note: The Buffer Size slider will move in steps as suggested by the ASIO driver. One of the advantages of this feature is that
you may have access to more granular buffer sizes than the driver panel offers. It is not guaranteed that every latency value
supplied by Cakewalk will be acknowledged by the driver.

StopEngineOnASIOPanelOpen Aud.ini variable
A few ASIO devices require that the host should not use the device while making changes to device settings. Some devices may
display an error or gray out the controls in the ASIO panel while others may silently ignore changes. In prior versions of Cakewalk,
the only solution was to exit the app for such devices. In version 2019.11, you can set the variable StopEngineOnPanelOpen in
Edit > Preferences > Audio - Configuration File. Setting it to True (default value) will automatically stop and release the ASIO
interface allowing you to change settings in Cakewalk.

Change preferences while audio is playing
You are now able to open the Preferences dialog box and change settings even while a project is playing. If a change is made that
requires the engine to restart, you will hear a small interruption in the audio while the changes are committed and playback will
continue after the change. This has the following benefits:

 Inspect or make changes to preferences without needing to stop playback or input monitoring.
 Make changes to audio latency while playing audio to adjust audio processing load dynamically. Note: This only works with ASIO
devices that can handle real time buffer configuration changes.

Instrument support for Mackie Control surface
Control of Synth Rack synths
Cakewalk Mackie Control support now allows control of the synth parameters of all synths in your Synth Rack.
Cakewalk exposes the Synth Rack as an additional strip, just like tracks, buses and hardware outputs are seen as strips. In the case
of the Synth Rack, however, there is only one channel, and each synth is seen as a separate entry in its FX Rack.

To access the Synth Rack
 On the Mackie Control MCU. Hold down M1 and press Plugin
 On the Mackie C4. Hold down Track button and select SynthR from the menu
 On other surfaces. Hold down Cycle or Scrub* and press Channel 4 Solo button
While in Synth Rack mode, the Mackie MCU/C4 cursor keys allow navigation through the synths within the rack, and their
parameters. The up/down cursor keys navigate through each instrument in the Synth Rack; the left/right cursor keys navigate
between through the banks of parameters.
On surfaces without cursor keys, pressing the Mute keys and Record Arm keys while holding down the “Cycle” (loop on/loop off) or
the Scrub button will allow you to select which synth to control and its bank of parameters. For example:

 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 1 Mute. Selects the first synth in the Synth Rack.
 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 2 Mute. Selects the second synth in the Synth Rack.
 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 1 Rec (arm). Selects parameters 1-8 of the currently selected synth.
 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 2 Rec (arm). Selects parameters 9-16 of the currently selected synth.
The channel V-Pots (i.e. pan controls) are used to alter the parameter values.

Note: On the Korg nanoKONTROL Studio, you must use the Scrub button (labeled as Scene), having first used the Korg
KONTROL editor software to configure the Scene button as Scrub.

Improved mode switching for Mackie compatible surfaces
For surfaces which lack the buttons for accessing many of the MCU functions, the following key combinations can be used when the
Cycle (loop on/off) or Scrub* button is held down:

 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 1 Solo. Control tracks.
 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 2 Solo. Control buses.
 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 3 Solo. Control hardware outputs.
 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 4 Solo. Control Synth Rack.
 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 7 Solo. Channel Parameter Mode (also toggles between single/multi channel).
 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 8 Solo. Plug-in Parameter Mode (also toggles between single/multi channel).

Improved plug-in effects navigation on MCU / compatibles
While controlling plug-ins on the MCU, the cursor keys now navigate through the plug-ins and their parameters rather than
controlling the cursor keys within Cakewalk. Note that Edit mode on the MCU must still be engaged to navigate through the banks of
parameters*
On surfaces without cursor keys, pressing the mute keys and record arm keys while holding down the “cycle” (loop on/loop off) or
Scrub button will allow you to select the parameter bank or effect.
For example:

 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 1 Mute. Selects the first effect in the FX Rack. **
 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 2 Mute. Selects the second effect in the FX Rack. **
…

 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 2 Mute. Selects the eighth effect in the FX Rack. **
 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 1 Rec-arm. Selects parameters 1-8 of the currently selected synth.
 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 2 Rec-arm. Selects parameters 9-16 of the currently selected synth.
…

 Cycle/Scrub + Channel 2 Rec-arm. Selects parameters 57-64 of the currently selected synth.
The channel V-Pots (i.e. pan controls) are used to alter the parameter values.
* Using Cycle/Scrub + Ch.4 Solo to enter synth mode, or Cycle/Scrub + Ch.8 Solo to engage Plug-in Parameter mode will also
automatically invoke edit mode. Pressing Cycle/Scrub + Ch.7 to engage Channel Parameter mode will also leave edit mode.
** The Pro Channel EQ and Pro Channel Compressor will appear before any effects in the FX Rack.

You can quickly duplicate the selected clip(s) with any of the following gestures:

 Press CTRL+D
 Click the Track view Clips menu and select Duplicate Selected Clip(s)
 Right-click in the Clips pane and select Duplicate Selected Clip(s) on the pop-up menu

The following rules apply when duplicating clips:

 Only events and clip automation are copied.
 The new clip(s) will be pasted immediately after the existing clip(s), respecting the current Ripple Edit settings.
 To respect the current Snap to Grid settings, go to Edit > Preferences > Customization - Editing and select Use Current Snap
Settings on Duplicate Selected Clip(s).

 After duplication, the Now time is forwarded to the end of the duplicate (with the duplicate selected), so you can press CTRL+D
again to make multiple duplicates

 Unlike a normal paste, the current track will have no bearing on where the duplicates are pasted. Duplicates will always appear on
the same tracks/lanes as the source selection.

Tip: If you want to quickly create many repetitions, use the Edit > Copy and Edit > Paste Special commands.

Tip: Duplicate Selected Clip(s) (CTRL+D) also works on Note events in the Piano Roll view.

In the previous versions of Cakewalk, settings in the Paste Special dialog box (Edit > Paste Special or CTRL+ALT+V) would
persist for the remainder of the Cakewalk session and apply when you used the regular Edit > Paste (or CTRL+V) command. As a
result, normal paste could potentially create multiple repetitions inadvertently. By default, normal paste no longer remembers the
settings from the Paste Special dialog box, so you will only get one copy. To remember the Paste Special settings, go to Edit >
Preferences > Customization - Editing and select Use Paste Special Options on Paste.

Use ripple edit for copy/paste/cut
Cakewalk now uses ripple editing (Ripple Edit Selection) during Edit > Paste Special when Slide Over Old to Make Room is
selected, and during Edit > Cut Special when Delete Hole is selected.

SHIFT+double-clicking a clip no longer hides other tracks
SHIFT+double-clicking a clip maximizes the clip, but no longer hides other tracks. This allows you to still show other tracks by
scrolling or zooming the Track view vertically.

Plug-in enhancements
Improvements to plug-in state loading and presets
Saving and loading plug-in states and presets has been streamlined and greatly improved and simplified to prevent unexpected
interactions with some 3rd party plug-ins. By preventing redundant plug-in parameter updates, plug-ins and synths now load faster
when opening project files.

Support for VST3 Program Changes
 Cakewalk now supports changing programs for VST3 plug-ins via a new Program change parameter. There is now a Preset value
at the end of the automation parameter list that will change plug-in preset values for plug-ins that support it. NOTE: This Preset
parameter is only displayed for plug-ins that expose VST3 program changes to the host. (It may not always be named “Preset”).

 Waves plug-ins support the new program change parameter.
 The new Preset parameter can be automated via envelopes.
 For supported VST3 plug-ins, program changes can be done during playback via MIDI messages. To do that you must enable
Translate Program Changes in the plug-in properties first and then restart the app.

 For some plug-ins, program changes can be expensive. Don’t use sweeps to automate the program change parameter. Instead
use jump events or linear sections.

Overhaul of plug-in time sync in engine
There has been an overhaul of the engine to improve and optimize time sync with plug-ins. The changes improve the accuracy of
time synchronization while seeking on the timeline during playback and while looping. We also addressed known problems with time
sync with Melodyne and other time dependent plug-ins that have an internal timeline.

Support for VST2 plug-ins without binary block persistence
There are a few VST2 plug-ins that do not support binary block persistence. E.g. VCV Rack. Cakewalk now properly restores
parameters for such plug-ins when loading projects.

Optimizations
 The overhaul of plug-in time sync in the engine improved the efficiency when playing back or looping projects with lots of plug-ins,
by eliminating many unnecessary and costly time unrolling conversions. This should yield moderate CPU gains while playing or
looping projects at low latency with lots of plug-ins, since the plug-in time conversions are now optimized.

 By preventing redundant plug-in parameter updates, plug-ins and synths now load faster when opening project files.
 Faster loading of project files containing many plug-ins and synths.
 Switching plug-in presets are now faster since there are fewer parameter updates.

Improved Reset/Panic
The Reset button

in the Transport Control Bar module now clears stuck MIDI notes on virtual instruments more reliably.

In previous versions of Cakewalk, both hardware MIDI outputs and virtual instruments shared the same reset method, which used
controller 123 (all notes off) by default. VST3 as well as some VST2 soft synths don’t respond to controller 123, and instead require
individual note off messages in order to clear stuck notes.
The Reset button
now sends both controller 123 and individual note off messages to soft synths. For hardware MIDI outs, if
necessary you can use the PanicStrength Cakewalk.ini variable to specify the default behavior:
PanicStrength=0 (controller 123; default)
PanicStrength=1 (individual note off; slower)

Force a reload of the audio and MIDI engine
To force a restart of the audio and MIDI engine (only if the transport is not playing/recording), including a reset of ASIO, hold down
the CTRL key and click the Reset button

in the Transport Control Bar module.

This release features many significant enhancements to the Mackie Control surface, including:

 ProChannel EQ, Track Compressor & Bus Compressor support
 Korg nanoKONTROL Studio support for Select button, Buses/Track selection
 HUI Protocol support
 Disable Handshake option for surfaces which only support the newer MCU protocol
 Automatic Fader assignment based on order added within preferences
 Key press support for function buttons / footswitches
 Added button mappings
 Updated command list to match Cakewalk internal list
Support for alternative parameter labels
You can now specify alternative label names for your parameters within MackieControl.ini (located in C:\Program
Files\Cakewalk\Shared Surfaces). This may be useful if the automatic abbreviated 6 character label isn’t as readable as
you’d like.
The alternative labels are still limited to 6 characters (as this is the limit of characters for each strip on the Mackie devices), but you
can now specify your own by adding them to the bottom of each plug-in section in the following format:
VPotLabeln=p,name
Where:
n = the number of the vpot
p = the number of the VST parameter whose label you which to override
name = the new label
e.g.
VPotLabel0=17,HiGain
VPotLabel1=18,HiFreq
M1VPotLabel2=19,Hi Q

Improved audio dropout diagnosis
When a dropout occurs, playback stops and a toast notification shows the detected dropout reason code. This code can be useful in
tracking down the cause of dropouts.

The following table lists the dropout reason codes and, when applicable, potential preventative action that may be taken.

Note: The dropout reason codes are primarily intended for use by Cakewalk Support as a diagnostic tool. Please contact
Cakewalk Support if you are experiencing persistent audio engine dropouts that you are unable to remedy on your own.

Play List enhancements
The Play List contains several enhancements that can be helpful when using Cakewalk in a live performance. The various Play List
buttons and menu commands now also show descriptive information in the Help Module.

Option for Play List to close projects regardless of project changes
When using the Play List, the new File > Discard Project Changes During Playback option allows the Play List to automatically
discard any changes before loading the next song. This lets you make minor temporary changes during playback, such as adjusting
levels, without being prompted to save the changes before loading the next song. During playback, the Play List will ignore a
project's modified state and close without saving. This option is enabled by default.

Note: The Discard Project Changes During Playback option is only active during (Play List) playback. Cakewalk will always
prompt to save a modified project if playback is stopped.

172

New features
Play List enhancements

Option for Play List to preload the next song during playback
By default, the Play List loads the next song while the current song is playing. While this can save time before the next project starts
playing, it may cause glitches when loading large complex projects projects during playback.
To defer loading the next song until playback of the current song has finished, disable the File > Preload Next Song During
Playback option.

Automatically stop/pause playback with MCI MIDI events
You can instruct Cakewalk to stop or pause playback at a defined moment, so you can start playback again manually. This can be
very useful in a live setting.
This is done by inserting an MCI Command event in a MIDI track’s Event List view (ALT+8), and assigning the MCI command’s value
to either stop or pause:

 stop. Stops the transport and returns to zero
 pause. Pauses the transport allowing you to manually continue playback from where you left off
Press Play (SPACEBAR) manually to resume playback.

Comping and Take lane enhancements
Comping and take management has undergone a massive overhaul for this release with many workflow improvements,
optimizations and bug fixes. A few highlights:

Freely assemble clips in Take lanes
Take lanes are now equally suited for both assembling clips and comping. Freely assemble clips in Take lanes either by recording or
dragging and dropping from different sources.

Optionally disable Smart tool comping behavior
If you are not creating a comp track, but simply assembling clips in Take lanes, you might find that the Smart tool’s
comping
behavior produce unintended results in certain situations, such as inadvertently isolating clips in when clicking the bottom half of
clips.
You can configure the Smart tool to disable comping features while editing clips in Take lanes and re-enable it when you are ready to
start building a comp track. For details, see “To customize the Smart tool” on page 577.

Copy/paste and drag drop enhancements
There have been numerous improvements and bug fixes with selection and copy paste:

 Inter project drag and drop and copy/paste support for Take lanes and Automation lanes.
 Improved drag drop preview to visually represent the final data.
 Full support for drag and drop of Take lanes between tracks.
 New lanes are auto appended to tracks when dropping/pasting clips from multiple Take lanes.
 Lane order is retained when dropping/pasting clips from multiple lanes.
 Improved support for pasting track and clip envelopes in lanes.
 Ability to drag multiple audio files from Browser to Take lanes.
Behavior changes
In order to improve workflow, a few default behaviors have changed:

 Editing clips in Take lanes no longer modifies track automation. If you want track automation to follow when you drag a clip in a
Take lane, drop the clip on the parent track (comp clip) instead of a Take lane.

 When isolating clips in Take lanes during playback, the Now time no longer automatically jumps to the beginning of the isolated
clip. To jump to the clip start when isolating clips, hold down the SHIFT key. You can also audition the selected clip by pressing
SHIFT+SPACEBAR.

Note: The Delete Muted Takes composite clip context menu command has been renamed to Delete Muted Clips to better
reflect its function. The command does not delete muted Take lanes, but rather deletes muted clips in the current track that span
the composite clip duration.

Intuitive mouse cursors
The time ruler now uses more intuitive mouse cursors for selection, loop, punch and marker drag bars and handles.
The mouse cursor shows a letter to indicates which marker will be modified before you actually click the marker: S (Selection), L
(Loop), P (Punch), and M (Marker). This is helpful when different marker types overlap.
Whether you point to a marker, click, or drag, Cakewalk now uses a single consistent mouse cursor for all gestures.

Improved range dragging behavior
Loop and Punch region markers always appear as interconnected pairs (Start and End). You can now drag a Loop or Punch marker
past its paired sibling marker in order to flip the range in the opposite direction. For example, you can drag the Loop End marker
earlier than the Loop Start marker.
Loop and Punch markers now also preview while dragging.

Tip: If multiple markers overlap, you can click any of the overlapping markers and keep the mouse button down, then press TAB to
cycle through to the marker you want to move. For example, if a selection, loop, and punch marker are all at measure 5, pressing TAB

Cakewalk now supports version 2 of the ARA (Audio Random Access) plug-in extension, and is compatible with ARA 2 plug-ins such
as Melodyne 4 and Synchro Arts Revoice Pro, as well as all future ARA 2 compatible plug-ins. ARA 2 provides tighter, more efficient
app integration of next generation ARA plug-ins, including sharing tracks, regions, selection, as well as other project attributes.
Cakewalk continues to support ARA 1 plug-ins as well.

Note: While Cakewalk has implemented support for most of the ARA 2 standard, the availability of these features is plug-in
dependent. For example, some ARA 2 plug-ins such as Melodyne may show explicit track or clip selection feedback, while other
plug-ins may not expose this in the user interface.

Shared view for all ARA plug-in instances
A single plug-in view is now used to show all ARA 2 plug-in instances of the same type in the project. Clicking or double-clicking on
any ARA 2 plug-in region will reuse the same view. This makes working with multiple ARA clips in a project much quicker, such as
when comping, since plug-in views no longer need to open and close for each clip.

Track and clip selection
The selection state for tracks and clips in Cakewalk are automatically sent to ARA plug-ins. If supported by the plug-in, selection may
be shown in the plug-in view. For example, blobs for selected tracks and clips in Cakewalk are automatically highlighted in
Melodyne.

Track/Clip color
Plug-ins may colorize their UI based on Cakewalk track and clip colors.

Track/Region/Project names
Plug-ins can access the descriptive names for tracks, clips and the project itself.

Multi-clip slip stretching
You can now slip stretch multiple selected audio and MIDI clips simultaneously.

To slip stretch multiple clips
1. Set the track’s Edit Filter control to Clips.
2. Select the clips you want to stretch. Note: Slip stretching is not allowed on Groove clips, and only available for ARA Region FX
clips that explicitly support slip stretching (including Melodyne).
3. Do one of the following on any selected clip:

 With the Smart tool

, hold down CTRL+SHIFT and position the pointer over the clip’s first half and drag to stretch the
beginning, or position the pointer over the clip’s second half and drag to stretch the end.

 With the Stretch tool

, position the pointer over the clip’s first half and drag to stretch the beginning, or position the pointer
over the clip’s second half and drag to stretch the end. Tip: The Stretch tool now supports lasso selection and time selection.

 With the Edit tool

, hold down CTRL+SHIFT and position the pointer over the clip’s first half and drag to stretch the
beginning, or position the pointer over the clip’s second half and drag to stretch the end.

The selected clips are stretched or compressed by the same absolute duration, gated by a stretch range of 25–400%.

Instrument track Input Gain parameter
You can now control both audio input gain and MIDI velocity offset on Instrument tracks. The pre-fader Input Gain parameter allows
you to fine tune the track’s volume, while the Velocity Offset parameter lets you apply a velocity offset to note events.
Instrument tracks can show either audio or MIDI controls by selecting the Audio tab or MIDI tab at the bottom of the Inspector.
In previous versions of Cakewalk, the Gain knob in the Inspector always controlled velocity offset. The Gain knob now controls
audio input gain if the Audio tab is selected, or velocity offset if the MIDI tab is selected.

zplane élastique audio stretching and pitch shifting

Cakewalk now supports industry standard élastique Pro V3 by zplane.development as a time stretching engine, for both online and
offline rendering. élastique is deeply integrated into Cakewalk across the entire ecosystem of AudioSnap and time/pitch processing
operations. Two new stretch methods, Elastique Efficient and Elastique Pro, are now available as new stretch methods throughout
the application (Elastique Efficient is now the default online stretch method instead of Groove stretching).

Benefits
élastique has several advantages over other stretch methods, including:

 Real-time stretching has much higher quality than Groove or Percussion stretching algorithms.
 Transparent, high quality pitch shifting and time stretching.
 More efficient memory use.
 Very fast and efficient processing for both Elastique Efficient and Elastique Pro algorithms.
 Transient preservation without phasing artifacts.
 Formant preserving pitch shifting for both monophonic and polyphonic material.
Use cases
élastique is integrated across the entire ecosystem of AudioSnap and time/pitch processing operations. It is available for use in the
following use cases:

 Slip stretching regular audio clips (see “Slip-stretching audio” on page 792 and “To stretch an audio clip” on page 632).
 Using AudioSnap clips (see “AudioSnap” on page 751).
 Stretching audio clips to automatically follow the project tempo (see “To sync an audio clip to the project tempo” on page 770 and
“Clip follows project tempo” on page 1572).

 Using the Process > Transpose command (see “Process > Transpose” on page 1520).
 Using the Process > Quantize and Process > Groove Quantize commands to quantize AudioSnap beats (see “To quantize
audio to the project’s Time Ruler” on page 780 and “To Groove Quantize an audio clip” on page 780).

 Using the Process > Length command (see “Process > Length” on page 1522 and “Stretching and shrinking events” on page
866).

 Using the Process > Fit to Time command (see “Process > Fit to Time” on page 1523 and “Stretching and shrinking events” on
page 866).

 Using VocalSync clips (see “VocalSync automatic audio alignment” on page 1188 and “To specify default render modes for new
VocalSync clips” on page 1195).

Online Render and Offline Render modes under Stretch Methods. The online render mode is used for real-time playback, and the
offline render mode is used for export, freeze, and bounce. For details, see “Algorithms and rendering” on page 795.

New features
zplane élastique audio stretching and pitch shifting

199

There are two new stretch methods:

 Elastique Pro is a general purpose high quality time-stretching engine that fulfills the demands of professional productions and
broadcast applications. It minimizes stretching artifacts, offers stable timing, inter-channel phase coherence and sample accurate
stretching which allows for sharp transients and crystal clear vocals.

 Elastique Efficient gives you similar time-stretching quality as Elastique Pro, but with a lower CPU hit. The algorithm is targeted
at complex polyphonic signals like complete mixes and offers the same transient preservation as Elastique Pro.

Note: You can override the default stretch method at the track and clip level by selecting a different Online Render or Offline
Render setting in the Clip Properties Inspector, Track Properties Inspector, or AudioSnap palette.

200

New features
zplane élastique audio stretching and pitch shifting

Backward compatibility
élastique is only available in Cakewalk release 2018.09 and higher. Because prior versions of Cakewalk (or SONAR) do not support
this feature, projects utilizing élastique as a stretch method will not render properly in prior versions. A warning message will be
displayed when you open a new Cakewalk project in an older version of the software.
If you need to share project files with a prior version of Cakewalk, select one of the older stretch methods before saving the project.
Alternatively, you can reset the stretch method in the earlier version of Cakewalk.

Specify default stretch methods in Preferences dialog
You can now specify the default global online and offline stretch methods in the Preferences dialog box, for both regular audio clips
and VocalSync clips.
The stretch method determines which algorithm Cakewalk uses for AudioSnap, stretching, pitch shifting, and bouncing audio clips.
For details, see “Algorithms and rendering” on page 795.
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording.
2. Under Stretch Methods, select the desired default Online Render and Offline Render modes. The online render mode is used
for real-time playback, and the offline render mode is used for export, freeze, and bounce.

Cakewalk uses the default stretch methods whenever the Online Render or Offline Render mode is set to Default in the Track
Properties Inspector or Clip Properties Inspector (the inherited stretch method name is shown in parenthesis), but you can override
the default render modes at the track and clip level.
The following diagram shows how the default stretch methods propagate to tracks and clips.

Tracks
Audio tracks inherit the default global stretch
method unless overridden in the Track Properties
Inspector (under Stretch Methods).

Clips
Individual clips inherit their parent track’s stretch

Improved continuous controller drawing
It is now easier to draw new controller data with the Smart Tool
of data present.
In previous versions of Cakewalk, the default Smart tool

in the Piano Roll view Controller pane when there is already lots

behavior was to always allow moving/resizing of individual data points

when the mouse hovered over them, which made it impossible to draw new data without switching to the Draw tool
Figure 58.

.

The Smart tool lets you draw new controller events even when lots of existing events are present.

If you want to move controller events instead of draw new events, do one of the following:

 Zoom in horizontally until you are able to grab individual controller events. The Smart Tool

allows moving/resizing of individual

controller events if they are more than 8 pixels wide.

 Temporarily switch to the Move tool

VST Scan enhancements

The VST scanner is now more robust and able to handle badly behaved plug-ins that might otherwise corrupt or stop the scanning
process.
There are two new VST scan options under Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings:

Scan in Sandbox
The Scan in Sandbox option allows the VST scanner to scan each plug-in within a private scanner process, which isolates the plugins from critical system resources. While this is slightly slower, it is more robust and prevents plug-ins from corrupting or stopping the
scanning process.

Generate Scan Log
When the Generate Scan Log option is enabled, the VST scanner logs the VST scanning progress to
%APPDATA%\Cakewalk\Logs\VstScan.log. This can be useful to troubleshoot problems when plug-ins fail to scan properly.

Note: Logging is intended for diagnostic purposes, and can have overhead. Generate Scan Log should only be enabled if
instructed by BandLab technical support.

4. Do one of the following:

 To move notes to the active track. Hold down the ALT key and right-click any selected note.
 To move notes to a different position in the active track. Hold down the ALT key a drag any selected note with the right
mouse button. Tip: Hold down ALT+SHIFT to restrict vertical or horizontal movement.

 To copy notes to the active track. Hold down CTRL+ALT and right-click any selected note.
 To copy notes to a different position in the active track. Hold down CTRL+ALT a drag any selected note with the right
mouse button. Tip: Hold down CTRL+ALT+SHIFT to restrict vertical or horizontal movement.

Tip: If you prefer to always paste copied notes into the active track, click the Piano Roll view Notes menu and select Always Paste
Copied Notes into Active Track. This allows you to copy notes to the active track without having to the use the ALT key and right
mouse button.

Tip: When Auto Lock is disabled and using the Smart tool
to lasso select notes, you can temporarily limit selection to the active
track only. This prevents unintended selection of notes in other tracks. To do so, hold down the SHIFT key while dragging with the right
mouse button. Only notes in the active track will be selected.

Note: Previously, ALT+Right-click would mute notes. This is now accomplished with SHIFT+Right-click.

Clean Audio Folder enhancements
The Clean Audio Folder utility lets you free up disk space by deleting obsolete audio files that are no longer used by a project.
In previous versions of Cakewalk, Clean Audio Folder would always search the entire computer, which could take a long time. You
can now choose to only scan the current project folder, which only takes a few seconds.

To scan the current project only
1. Open the project you want to scan.
2. Go to Utilities > Clean Audio Folder.
3. Make sure the Project/Audio Folder field is set to the root folder the project lives in.
4. Make sure Search entire PC is not selected.
5. Click Find. Cakewalk recursively searches the selected folder for audio files that are unused by the current project, and displays
the names of these files in the list.

Note: Select Search entire PC if you have backup versions of the current project file saved in another location.

Tip: If you save multiple copies of a project in subfolders, set Project/Audio Folder to the root folder that contains the projects. This
ensures that all the projects will be scanned.

To scan all projects
1. Make sure that all of your important project (.cwp) files are stored on your local hard disk(s). If your project files are stored
elsewhere (removable media, etc.), then you risk accidentally deleting important audio files that are associated with your
projects.
2. Close all projects.
3. Go to Utilities > Clean Audio Folder.
4. Make sure the Project/Audio Folder field is set to the global audio folder (default when no project is loaded). Search entire PC
is automatically enabled.
5. Click Find. Cakewalk searches the entire system for project files, and lists any audio files in the Project/Audio Folder that do
not belong to projects on your system. If any corrupted or unreadable project files exist on your system, the Unreadable Files
dialog box appears. It is very important that you restore any unreadable files from a backup before continuing, otherwise you risk
data loss.

Note: If you manually set Project/Audio Folder to an audio-only folder, all audio files will be shown as orphaned unless you
select Search entire PC.

Tip: If you have a single folder that contains all your projects, point Project/Audio Folder to this folder to scan all the projects.

Beginner’s guide to Cakewalk software

If you have little or no experience using music software to play and record music, this guide is for you. This guide explains the terms
and concepts you need to know to use music software. You can get much more help by using the Help menu, or by pressing F1
when you have any view or dialog box open.
Note: The graphics in this document are from different varieties of Cakewalk software, including older versions.

The basic way that you use a computer to record and play sound is this: your computer has a circuit board in it called a sound card,
which converts the sound from an electric instrument or microphone into a long string of numbers, which a computer stores and then
converts back into sound when you want to play the recording. Almost every computer comes with a sound card which is good
enough to make very good, but not fully professional-level recordings.
The sound card has inputs and outputs on it, which you can see by looking at the back of your computer.

A
B
A. Inputs and outputs B. Joystick port

To record, for example, an electric guitar into the computer, you plug one end of your guitar cable into your guitar, and plug the other
end into the Line input of your sound card. Then you would click the Record button in your Cakewalk software, start playing your
instrument, and then click the Stop button (or press the SPACEBAR). The Line input has a little icon next to it, which is very hard to
recognize, so it usually helps to look at the documentation that came with your sound card or computer. A guitar cable has a plug on
it that is 1/4 inch wide (diameter), and the Line input on low-priced sound cards is 1/8 inch wide. You need to connect your guitar
cable to a 1/8 inch adapter in order to plug it into most sound cards. These adapters are inexpensive and are available at most
electronics supply stores.

1/4 inch to 1/8 inch adapter

If you want to record an acoustic instrument or vocal, you would use a microphone. You connect the microphone’s cable to the
adapter and plug the adapter into the Mic input of the sound card. You can get a better sound, however, by plugging the microphone
cable into a preamp, or a mixer with a preamp, and plugging the outputs of the mixer or preamp into the Line input of the sound card,
instead of the Mic input. You would then need an adapter to connect the two outputs (left and right) of the mixer or preamp to the 1/8
inch Line input. Ask the store where you buy your preamp or mixer what kind of adapter you need to connect to a sound card that
has 1/8 inch inputs.
Professional-quality sound cards do not use 1/8 inch inputs, so you do not need one of these adapters to use a professional-grade
sound card.

Beginner’s guide to Cakewalk software

221

To play back the music, you need to connect powered speakers or headphones to the output of the sound card, which on new
computers is usually color coded green. Then you click the Rewind button (or press w) in your Cakewalk software, and then click
the Play button (or press the SPACEBAR) to play back what you recorded.
Music software uses two different formats to play and record sound—“MIDI” on page 222 and “Audio” on page 227. Knowing the
differences between the two formats is essential for using most music software.
For more information, see:
“MIDI” on page 222
“Audio” on page 227
“Audio hardware (sound cards) and drivers” on page 237

MIDI
Besides introducing MIDI in this section, we’ll explain the following MIDI topics:

 “MIDI channels, interfaces, inputs, and outputs” on page 223
 “MIDI drivers” on page 224
 “MIDI files, projects, tracks, and clips” on page 224
 “Controlling which sounds you hear” on page 226
Short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, MIDI is a system that lets an electronic instrument or computer control other
instruments. MIDI is largely a set of commands, called MIDI messages, that cause an electronic instrument to play specific sounds
at specific times, and also to play those sounds in the style that you dictate. A MIDI instrument functions very much like a player
piano, only instead of using a roll of paper with holes punched in it, a MIDI instrument needs a software program or other MIDI
instrument to turn its notes on and off. When you record MIDI, you don’t record the sound of the instrument you’re recording—you
record the commands that play that instrument in the way you want it to be played. For example, when you press a key on a MIDI
keyboard while your Cakewalk software is recording, the software just records the fact that a certain note was pressed and then
released—the software doesn’t record the actual sound of the note. When you play back the recording, the software takes control of
your MIDI instrument and turns the note on and then off at the same time in the song that you did. MIDI notes can be read and
displayed by a music notation program. Digital audio, the sound format used by CDs, Wave files, and MP3s, can not. After you
record your MIDI data you can use Cakewalk to convert the MIDI data into digital audio so that you can create CDs, MP3s, or
Windows Media files.
MIDI has advantages and disadvantages when compared to digital audio. MIDI files are much smaller than audio files, since MIDI
data is only made up of the commands to play instruments, instead of the actual sound of the instruments themselves. You can
easily email MIDI files. You can save a MIDI file in a format called a Standard MIDI File, and then open it and use it in many different
programs. You can record MIDI music as slowly as you want, and then change the tempo in your software to play it back at any
tempo you want. Audio files, however, can only play back at approximately the same tempo they were recorded at without drastically
altering the sound quality. It’s easy to edit and transpose MIDI files, since they are so small and you’re just editing commands, not
actual sound. MIDI files can be printed out as standard musical notation or lead sheets. It can be harder to make MIDI music sound
as natural as audio. If you don’t record MIDI music in real time, it can sound mechanical. Some MIDI instruments, especially some of
the acoustic-sounding instruments such as brass, strings, and guitars that you find on the built-in synthesizers of low-priced sound
cards, sound artificial. However, percussive sounds usually sound quite good on MIDI instruments, and are much easier to record
than a real drum set. You can also play back MIDI data through any number of hardware or software samplers that use recordings
(samples) of any instrument you can imagine as sound sources.

Beginner’s guide to Cakewalk software
MIDI

MIDI channels, interfaces, inputs, and outputs
Most MIDI instruments can play at least 16 different sounds at the same time—instruments that can play more than one sound at a
time are called multi-timbral (pronounced multi-tambral). In order to control which sounds respond to which commands, MIDI
messages are marked with a channel number from 1 to 16. That way a MIDI sound module, such as a drum machine, can tell which
messages are meant for which of the sounds it is capable of playing. Each instrument has a limit to the number of notes it can play
at one time, counting all the notes it is playing on all the sounds it is using combined. That number is usually between 32 and 128,
and is called polyphony.
You need some way to get MIDI messages into and out of your computer, so a MIDI system needs a piece of hardware called a MIDI
interface, which can be a stand-alone module connected to your computer’s parallel, serial, or USB port; an internal module
installed in a slot inside your computer; or can be part of your sound card. Your computer sends MIDI messages to your MIDI
interface, which then sends them on to your MIDI instruments. That’s how MIDI software plays MIDI instruments. A MIDI interface
contains inputs and outputs, labeled MIDI IN and MIDI OUT, which you connect MIDI cables to so you can send MIDI messages to
and from MIDI instruments. MIDI instruments can be stand-alone synthesizers or can be built into your sound card. Most
inexpensive sound cards have internal synthesizers that can make at least 128 different sounds (if you’re using a synthesizer that’s
built into your sound card, you don’t have to connect that to the sound card, since the connections are internal to the sound card).
Figure 63.

B

A. Connect one end to an OUT on your MIDI interface B. Connect the other end to an IN on your MIDI instrument

MIDI instruments have inputs and outputs labeled MIDI IN and MIDI OUT. You connect a MIDI cable from one of your MIDI
interface’s MIDI OUTs to a MIDI IN on an instrument. You also connect a MIDI cable from the MIDI OUT on one of your MIDI
instruments to the MIDI IN on your MIDI interface. The instrument that you connect to the MIDI IN of your interface is called a
controller, and typically has a piano-style keyboard for sending note on/off messages, pitch and modulation wheels, and perhaps
some sliders on it for sending other MIDI messages to the interface. You can also get MIDI converter modules that turn guitars,
drums, and other instruments into controllers. You can use a controller to record yourself playing in real time. When you play your
controller, the MIDI messages go to the interface, then into your computer, and then back to the interface and to a specific MIDI
instrument that’s connected to the interface. You choose what instrument the messages come back to by using the software. This
process of a computer sending back out the MIDI messages that it just received is called echoing. By using echoing, you can play
one MIDI instrument, but cause other MIDI instruments to play. Your controller usually has a setting on it called Local On/Off. When
your controller is connected to your interface, you need to set the Local On/Off setting to Local Off. That’s because if your software is
set to send MIDI messages back to your controller, when you play a note on your controller, it is sent to the computer, and then back
to the controller again through its MIDI IN, causing it to play two notes every time you play one note on it. When your controller is
set to Local Off, it won’t play a note on the controller when you press a key, but only when the Note On message comes back from
the computer, which happens instantaneously. Remember to set it back to Local On if you’re going to use the controller separate
from the computer.
MIDI instruments have a third port called a MIDI THRU port. This port passes through MIDI messages without changing them in any
way. You can chain MIDI instruments together by connecting the MIDI THRU port on one MIDI instrument to the MIDI IN port on
another instrument, with several instruments chained together that way. If you had a MIDI interface that had 8 outputs, and you
chained 3 instruments together on each of those outputs by using the MIDI THRU ports, you would be able to play 24 instruments at
one time.

MIDI drivers
Your MIDI interface needs a driver to function. A driver is a small software program that controls input and output for a peripheral
device. To use a MIDI interface in Cakewalk, you need to make sure that your interface’s driver is installed, and that you have told
Cakewalk to use it. That way, Cakewalk knows to use the driver and to list all of your interface’s inputs and outputs in the proper
menus. If your MIDI interface is part of your sound card, you probably installed its driver when you installed the sound card. You can
check this in Cakewalk in Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices. In the Outputs list, see if the name of your MIDI interface is listed.
It should be called something like SB Live MIDI Out. Make sure it is highlighted. In the Inputs list, you should see something like SB
Live MIDI In. Make sure this is highlighted and click OK. If you don’t see the name of your interface listed, you need to install its
driver from the CD/DVD or website that your interface’s documentation recommends.
After you have installed the driver and restarted your computer, you need to tell Cakewalk to use this particular driver. Go to Edit >
Preferences > MIDI - Devices. In the Outputs list, make sure that the name of your interface’s driver is selected. If it isn’t, click it to
select it. If your interface has more than one output, make sure you select the names of all the outputs. The order of the outputs in
the list determines what output numbers Cakewalk gives to each output. So even if an output on your interface has a label that says
1 or A, if it is not first in the list in the Outputs list, it will not be labeled 1 in Cakewalk. You can change the order in the list by
temporarily deselecting all the outputs except the one you want to move to the top, and then clicking the Move Selected Devices To
Top button that’s at the bottom of the dialog box. Then make sure you reselect the other outputs you want to use.
For more information, see:
“MIDI files, projects, tracks, and clips” on page 224

“MIDI channels, interfaces, inputs, and outputs” on page 223
“MIDI drivers” on page 224

MIDI files, projects, tracks, and clips
In Cakewalk programs, the file that you use to store usually a single song’s data is called a project. This is the file you use to record,
play back, and edit your song. The file extension for a project is .wrk in older Cakewalk programs and .cwp in newer ones. Projects
that use only the MIDI format (no digital audio) can be saved in a format called a Standard MIDI File, and can then be played back
in any program or machine that plays MIDI files. These files have the extension .mid.
The MIDI messages within a project are usually separated into smaller containers called tracks, and even smaller containers called
clips, which are sections of a track. You usually use tracks to separate the MIDI messages that are intended to play one kind of
sound from the MIDI messages that play other sounds. You usually assign each track to its own MIDI channel. A typical MIDI project
might have separate tracks for drums, bass, and piano. In this example, you might assign the bass track to Channel 2, and the piano
track to Channel 5. Then you would set your MIDI sound module to play a bass sound on Channel 2, and a piano sound on Channel
5. Instead of manually setting your MIDI modules to play these sounds, you can send Program Change messages to tell your sound
module what sounds to play on what channels (see “Controlling which sounds you hear” on page 226). You usually assign drum
tracks to Channel 10. Because you stored the MIDI messages that are assigned to each sound on separate tracks, you can then
control and edit the stored MIDI messages that go to one sound without changing the messages that are sent to other sounds.

pane. In the above picture, Tracks 1, 2, and 6 are still empty, while Tracks 3, 4, and 5 contain recorded data. Also notice that Track 3
is a different color from the other tracks, meaning that it has the focus, and will make the bass sound when you play your MIDI
keyboard (controller). If you click one of the other MIDI tracks to change the focus, the sound that’s selected for that track will sound
when you play your controller.
Figure 65.

Track 3 zoomed in to expose track property fields.

In the above picture, we zoomed in far enough by dragging the Vertical Zoom fader (see previous picture) to expose the track
property fields for each track. Use these to choose what MIDI channel each track is sending its messages out on, what sound
(patch) the track is sending the messages to, how loud the overall track volume is, what MIDI instrument you’re sending the track’s
data to, and several other property choices. Notice that the track’s number and its MIDI channel are not the same. Track numbers
and MIDI channels have nothing to do with each other, although you may want to keep them the same in a small project to make
remembering them easier. We could have sent Track 3’s MIDI messages out on any channel we wanted, just by selecting a different
number in the Ch field. Notice the MIDI cable logo just in front of the track name; the audio track above it has a different logo to
identify it as an audio track. The audio track has different track property fields from the MIDI track (notice there’s no Ch field).

Controlling which sounds you hear
Because each MIDI instrument can probably play many different sounds at the same time, you need a way to tell each instrument
which tracks are meant for which sounds. You do this by assigning a MIDI channel to each track, and by assigning a specific sound,
called a patch or program, to each track.
Because there are only 16 MIDI channels, and each instrument can probably play 16 different sounds at the same time, you need a
way to create more MIDI channels to make sure that instruments play only the notes that are specifically meant for them. The way
a MIDI program gets around this limitation is by assigning an output number to each group of 16 MIDI channels. For example, if
your MIDI interface has 8 outputs, you might set your first 16 tracks to use output 1, the next 16 tracks to use output 2, and so on.
The MIDI messages on the first 16 tracks would only be sent out through the cable that comes out of the first output port, the
messages from the next 16 tracks would only come out of output 2, and so on. So if your MIDI interface has 8 outputs, you effectively
have 128 MIDI channels to work with. Of course, the way you choose what output you want to send a track’s data out of is
determined by what instrument is connected to that output. So, even if you only had a keyboard track and a drum track in your
project, and your favorite keyboard instrument was connected to output 1 of your MIDI interface and your drum machine was
connected to output 2, you would assign the keyboard track to use output 1 and the drum track to use output 2.
In the following figure, notice that the two tracks both use Channel 2. But these are not the same channel! The tracks are assigned
to different outputs, so the MIDI messages in these two tracks will be sent to different instruments. The bass track will send its data
out on Channel 2 of Output 2. The piano track will send its data out on Channel 2 of Output 1.

A. Output B. MIDI channel

If your interface only has one output, and you chain several instruments to that output by using the MIDI THRU ports on the
instruments, you can use the individual instruments’ own control panels to choose what MIDI channels they will respond to. That
way, an instrument can ignore any notes or other messages that are meant for a different instrument on the chain. This setting is
usually called MIDI Receive, and might be abbreviated on an instrument’s control panel as MIDI RX.
Since most projects have several tracks in them, and each track is usually assigned to a different sound, how do you control what
sound you hear when you press a key on your MIDI controller? In Cakewalk programs, one of your tracks is always highlighted,
because it has the focus. Whatever track you click grabs the focus, and the sound that’s selected for that track will sound when you
play your keyboard.

Audio
The audio format works by converting any sound that’s recorded into a long series of numbers, storing and usually editing the
numbers, and then converting the numbers back into sound.
When you record sound using this format, the microphone you use causes the voltage in its cable to change rapidly as the mic’s
diaphragm vibrates. These rapid changes in voltage are measured and recorded by an analog-to-digital converter, and these
measurements make up what we call digital audio. To convert digital audio back into sound, a digital-to-analog converter uses the
stored numbers to cause the voltage in a cable to change rapidly, and this voltage then moves the diaphragm in a loudspeaker in a
similar way to the way that the microphone’s diaphragm moved originally (unless the numbers have been edited to produce a more
desirable sound). These converters, commonly referred to as A to D or A/D, and D to A or D/A, are part of your computer’s sound
card. Better sound cards usually keep their converters in a separate box that’s not in the computer itself, because the computer’s fan
and disk drives add noise to the sound card’s signal.
Digital audio works like motion picture animation. In a motion picture, a series of still photographs is displayed rapidly in sequence to
make it look as if the objects in the photographs are moving. When digital audio is converted back into sound, the voltage is changed
at regular intervals to simulate continuous sound. To make high-quality sound, the original voltage during recording has to be
measured, or “sampled,” at rapid enough intervals to fool your ears into hearing continuous sound. Audio CDs use a sampling rate
of 44,100 per second. To store and edit so many numbers places a big load on most PCs, much bigger than the processing of MIDI
data causes.

Audio playback in Cakewalk
To use digital audio in Cakewalk, you first have to make sure that your sound card and its driver are properly installed. For
information about sound card and driver installation, see your sound card’s documentation, and also “Audio hardware (sound cards)
and drivers” on page 237.
After you’ve successfully tested your sound card and driver, you should play back one of the sample files that came with your
Cakewalk software.
To play back a sample file, use the File > Open command, navigate to a folder that has bundle files in it (they have the extension
.bun or .cwb), select a bundle file, and click Open. After the file loads, make sure that your speakers are turned on, and play the file
by pressing the SPACEBAR. You also can stop the file’s playback by pressing the SPACEBAR again. You should hear something.
You can rewind the file by pressing W, or by clicking the Rewind button

in the Control Bar.

If you don’t hear anything, here are several steps to take:

Playback troubleshooting table

Possible problem

What to do

The volume setting is turned down on your software
mixer, or wave playback is muted.

If your sound card only has one stereo output, your sound card probably responds to
the Windows Volume Mixer. If your sound card has more than one stereo output, it
might not respond to the Volume Mixer—launch your sound card’s own mixer software
if it has it, and make sure all volume settings are turned up and nothing is muted.
To open the Volume Mixer—right-click the Speaker icon
that’s on your Windows
taskbar and select Open Volume mixer to open the Volume Mixer dialog box. Make
sure that your audio device’s slider is turned up, and that none of the Mute buttons at
the bottom of the dialog box are enabled.

Your speakers aren't connected properly, or the volume is
turned down.

Make sure your speakers are on and the volume is turned up.

Your sound card isn't hooked up correctly.

Run the Microsoft Voice Recorder (Start > Voice Recorder). Record audio and see if it
plays back correctly through your speakers. If not, check your sound card
documentation to make sure it is properly installed and configured.

Your tracks’ initial volume settings are too low, or the
tracks are muted.

See “Track-by-track playback” on page 231.

Your audio tracks are assigned to the wrong playback
device.

Check the playback device assignment for an audio track by clicking the track’s Output
button or Out field. If the name of your sound card (the one you have connected to an
amp and speakers) is not selected on the pop-up menu, select it. If it’s not listed, go to
Edit > Preferences > Audio - Devices and make sure the name of your sound card is
selected in the Output Drivers list. Next, go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver
Settings and make sure the sound card is selected in the Playback Timing Master
list.
If you don’t see anything resembling the name of your sound card, anywhere, see the
next step.

Cakewalk doesn't recognize your sound card.

Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings and click the Wave Profiler
button to test your audio hardware. Then try playing the file again.
Note: It is not necessary to run the Wave Profiler for a sound card using an ASIO
driver.

Tracks
A track is represented by a horizontal strip in the Track view that has a name and number on the left side (each track is also
represented by a vertical module in the Console view). A track is a container you usually use to keep the sound from each
instrument separate from the others—you usually keep the sound from each instrument on a separate track.
In the following picture, you can see the visual results of recording the first 3 notes of “Three Blind Mice” as audio in Track 1, and as
MIDI in Track 2.

A. Name of Track 1 B. Three C. Blind C. Mice

Notice that the graph (or picture, Cakewalk stores these picture files in the Picture Cache folder in the Cakewalk Projects folder) of
the audio data follows the natural decay in loudness of a sound after each note is struck. This is as expected since the pictures
represent the actual sound that is recorded. The MIDI track’s graph is much simpler, since it only represents commands to turn a
certain note on for a certain time period, then turn another note on, etc. We zoomed in on these two tracks far enough to expose all
the track property fields, such as Volume, Pan, Input, Output, etc. Notice the different logos left of the track names that distinguish
audio tracks from MIDI tracks. Notice the data in the audio track’s Out field: A. This is the name of the output driver that this
particular sound card uses. If your sound card only has one pair of outputs (or one stereo output), you don’t have to change anything
in the Out field. Cakewalk fills it in automatically as soon as Cakewalk finishes running the Wave Profiler. If your sound card has
more than one pair of outputs, or you have more than one sound card installed and enabled on your computer, you can use this field
to choose what pair of outputs you want to hear a specific track played back through.
Note: It is not necessary to run the Wave Profiler for a sound card using an ASIO driver.

Clips
A clip is a portion of the audio or MIDI data in a track that is bounded by a vertical line on each end of the clip. You can click a clip to
select it—a selected clip becomes highlighted. After you select a clip, you can copy it, drag it to a new location, delete it, or use any
command in the Edit menu to alter it. A clip can be any size. A clip that is an exact number of beats or measures and is suitable for
repetition, such as a drum pattern, is frequently called a loop. Clips are also sometimes called events. A track can have no clips (no
data at all), one clip (all the track’s data is in one clip), or many clips. Having lots of clips in a track increases processing time for your
computer.
In the following picture, the Split tool was used to separate the audio in Track 1 into three clips. You can activate the Split tool by
pressing F8 on your keyboard, at which time the cursor turns into a small scissors icon. After you activate the Split tool, you can click
the track data at the points where you want to split it into clips.

A. Clips

You can rearrange the sound in both audio and MIDI tracks by dragging and/or copying clips. The precision of the clips’ movement is
governed by the Snap to Grid button
, which you can configure in the Control Bar’s Snap module. Additional snap settings are
available in Edit > Preferences > Customization - Snap to Grid. In the following picture, the clips in Track 1 have been moved
around to reverse their order, so instead of the first three notes of Three Blind Mice, we now have Mice Blind Three.

Track-by-track playback
You can change a track’s volume by dragging its volume fader (see the following figure). You can silence a track by clicking its Mute
button

(any button you click lights up when it’s enabled). You can also silence all other tracks besides one if you click a track’s

Solo button
. You can click either of these buttons while a project is playing, and you can mute or solo as many tracks as you
want. You can also silence a track by archiving it, but you have to stop playback to archive or un-archive a track. To archive or unarchive a track, click the track’s Archive button
. Archiving a track removes its data from your computer’s memory (RAM), freeing
up more memory for other tracks that you may be working on.

What it means

Normal

The track plays unless one or more of your other tracks is soloed.

Muted

The track is not played, but you can turn it on while playback is in progress.

Archived

The track is not played, and you must stop playback to re-enable it. Archived tracks do not tax your CPU during
playback so they can be used to store alternate takes.

Soloed

Only those tracks that are designated as solo tracks are played; all others are muted.

If a track is both muted and soloed, it does not play. Mute has precedence.

Audio recording
If your sound card and driver are properly installed, recording audio data is mostly a matter of accomplishing two tasks:

 Connecting an instrument, home stereo, or microphone to an input on your sound card
 Choosing that same input in Cakewalk, your sound card’s software, and/or Windows
For more information, see:
“Connecting an instrument, home stereo, or microphone to your sound card” on page 232
“Choosing inputs” on page 236
“Audio recording” on page 232
“Audio hardware (sound cards) and drivers” on page 237
“MIDI” on page 222

Connecting an instrument, home stereo, or microphone to your sound card
You need a cable with the correct plug on the end of it to connect an instrument or mic to your sound card. Low-priced sound cards
usually have 1/8 inch analog jacks (inputs) marked Mic and Line, and might have a digital input marked S/PDIF. The Line input is the
correct one for most electronic instruments such as electric guitars. The Mic input is calibrated to accept the input from microphones
(however, you can usually get a better recorded sound by plugging a mic into a preamp or mixer with preamp, and plugging the
preamp or mixer into the Line input). The S/PDIF input is the one to use for digital audio sources such as samplers and some CD
players. Guitar cables usually have a 1/4 inch plug on the end, so to connect an electric guitar to a 1/8 inch jack, you need a 1/4 inchto-1/8 inch adapter, which is readily available at electronics supply stores. If you’re not sure what kind of inputs your sound card has,
you can actually measure their width (diameter).
If you have a more professional-grade sound card, the input jacks will probably be 1/4 inch, and you might also have some XLR
inputs for low-impedance microphones, and S/PDIF and possibly AES/EBU connections for digital input and output. If your
microphone cable has an XLR plug on the end of it (an XLR plug has 3 pins sticking out of it), and your sound card only has 1/4 inch
input jacks, you need to put an XLR-to-1/4 inch adapter on the end of your microphone cable.
The following table summarizes the possible sound card inputs, types of cables required, and the inputs to plug into.

use standard stereo component cables.

Connect your digital source (probably a sampler or CD
player with digital outputs) to your sound card’s S/PDIF input
using a 75 ohm coaxial video cable, or special S/PDIF cable.

Inputs to plug into

Electric guitar direct-in
You can connect an electric guitar directly to your sound card using a 1/4 inch mono to 1/8 inch stereo adapter. The following
diagram shows this setup:
Figure 66.

Electric guitar direct in.

To sound card microphone input (mono)
1/4 inch instrument
cable
1/4 inch to 1/8 inch adapter

The 1/8 inch plug should be plugged into the sound card’s Line input, although plugging into the Mic input will also work.

Electric guitar through effects rack
You can also plug an electric guitar into an effects rack, then send the output of the rack to the sound card’s input, as shown in the
following diagram:
Figure 67.

Electric guitar through effects rack.

Rack effects units

This diagram assumes that the output of the rack is at line level (consult your rack’s documentation). If it is at pro level instead (+4
dB), and your sound card does not accept a +4 db input, you will need to attenuate (lower) the F/X rack’s signal. To do this, use a
mixer between the rack’s output and the Y-adapter. If the rack has only a mono output, a 1/4 inch mono to 1/8 inch stereo adapter
should be used instead of a Y-adapter.
If you want to connect a guitar amplifier’s direct output to the sound card, you should base your setup on this example.

Microphone direct-in
Microphones can be plugged into the sound card’s Mic input. Some inexpensive microphones are made especially for use with
sound cards and come equipped with 1/8 inch plugs. However, better quality microphones take better quality cables, which do not
terminate in 1/8 inch plugs. The following figure illustrates how to connect a microphone that terminates in a 1/4 inch plug to a 1/8
inch input:
Figure 68.

Home stereo, CD player, radio tuner, preamp output
The output of a stereo component can be connected to the sound card’s Line input, using a dual RCA to 1/8 inch stereo mini Yadapter. Many portable cassette players come with this kind of adapter, or even with a single cable with all the necessary plugs. In
the following diagram, a stereo component is connected to the Y-adapter using standard RCA cables:

If you are using your computer’s internal CD player, and it does not have its audio output cable connected internally to the sound
card, run a cable from the CD player’s Headphone jack to the card’s Line input. If there is no Headphone jack, you’ll need to use an
external CD player.

Beginner’s guide to Cakewalk software
Audio

Mixer
You can connect a mixer to the sound card with a setup of the following kind:
Figure 70.

Mixer.

From sound card line output
to inputs #1 & 2
From Aux Bus #1 & 2
to sound card line
input
Stereo Amplifier
Main mixer outs to power amp

1/4 inch instrument cable to input #3

Let’s trace the signal flow in the above picture:
1. Your pre-recorded tracks flow out of the sound card’s outputs into mixer inputs #1 and 2.
2. Both the pre-recorded tracks and the live guitar’s sound flow into the main mixer outs, where you can hear them (monitor them)
through the stereo amplifier and speakers.
3. If you turn up the bus send #1 on the guitar input (mixer input #3), the guitar sound flows into a sound card line input out of bus
#1. You could turn up the bus send #2 control on the guitar input if you wanted to use that instead, since both buses #1 and #2
are patched into the sound card’s line input. You could also use both bus sends at the same time to double the guitar’s mono
signal if you wanted (not the usual way to record).
4. Since you’re already hearing the guitar through the main outputs, you probably don’t want to hear its signal again coming back
through the sound card’s outputs, so mute the sound card’s line-in on its Play Control page of its mixer software (not its Record
Control page—you want to record the line-in, but not play it back).
5. If you plug other instruments into other inputs, you can send them into your sound card’s line input by turning up bus send #1
and/or #2 on each of the mixer’s channels.
6. If the guitar in the above picture had a stereo pickup and stereo cable, you could plug the left plug on the cable into input #3 and
turn up bus send #1, and plug the right plug into input #4, and turn up bus send #2 on that input. You would then be sending a
stereo signal from the guitar through buses #1 and #2 to the sound card’s line input.
7. In the above setup, do not turn up the bus sends on inputs #1 or #2 (where the sound card’s line outputs connect to the mixer)—
this creates a feedback loop, feeding the sound card’s outputs back into its inputs through the buses.

235

Choosing inputs
After you’ve connected your instrument or other sound source to your sound card, you need to tell your sound card’s software,
Cakewalk, and possibly the Windows Mixer which input you’re recording through. If you’re recording through the S/PDIF input, the
procedure is a little different (see “To record through the S/PDIF input” on page 237).
If your sound card only has one pair of inputs (one stereo Line input, usually, or Line and Mic inputs that can’t be used
simultaneously), then your sound card probably responds to the Windows Mixer.
Use the following procedure to record a track using the Windows Mixer.

To record with Cakewalk and the Windows Mixer
1. Open the Windows Mixer—double-click the Speaker icon that’s on your Windows taskbar to open the Play Control dialog box.
If you don’t see the Speaker icon on your taskbar, you can open the Windows Mixer by using the following command:

 Windows 7: Start > Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Volume Control
2. In the Play Control dialog box, use the Options > Properties command, and select Recording (under Adjust Volume For).
3. Under Adjust Volume For, make sure Line-In and Microphone are checked, and click OK.
The Record Control dialog box appears.
4. If you’re recording through the Line input, click the Select check box that’s at the bottom of the Line-In column, and make sure
that the volume slider in that column is in the upper half of its range (if you’re recording through the Mic input, do the same
actions in the Microphone column). Minimize the Windows Mixer window.
5. In Cakewalk’s Track view, use the In field in a track you want to record in to select the input you’re using—select either the Left
input of your sound card to record in mono or the Stereo input to record in stereo.
6. Arm the track for recording (click its R button so that it’s red), and play your instrument. You should see the Record Meter at the
bottom of the track’s property fields light up. If the meter doesn’t move, see the table immediately following this procedure.
7. Adjust your instrument’s volume, and/or the volume slider in the Record Control dialog box so that the level in the Record meter
almost reaches the red zone when you play your loudest notes.
8. Record some sound by pressing r to start recording, and pressing the SPACEBAR when you’re finished. You can rewind by
pressing w.
After you stop recording, you should see a picture of your audio data in the Clips pane of the track you’re recording in. Don’t forget to
disarm the track and save your project if you want to keep what you recorded.
If you don’t see any movement in the track’s record meter when you play your instrument, try some of the following:
Possible problem

Solution

You have chosen a Right input of your sound card as an input, but your
instrument is plugged into a Left input.

Click the armed track’s Input button and choose the opposite input from
the currently selected one. If that doesn’t help, try selecting the Stereo
input.

Your instrument is plugged into a different-numbered input from the one
you selected as an input.

Try choosing different-numbered Inputs until the meter starts to move.

Your instrument is not turned up or its cable is bad.

Turn up the instrument and try different cables.

You’re using an adapter that doesn’t quite fit the sound card input.

Try moving the adapter in or out slightly, and make sure the cable is
plugged all the way into it.

If your sound card has multiple inputs and has its own mixer software, you probably don’t need to select inputs in the Windows Mixer.
To record through the analog inputs on your sound card, you probably only need to set your sound card’s clock to internal, and in
Cakewalk’s Track view, choose the correct number of the inputs you’re connected to in the In field of the track you’re recording.
To record through the digital input (S/PDIF), see the following procedure.

236

Beginner’s guide to Cakewalk software
Audio

To record through the S/PDIF input
1. Connect the instrument or CD player you want to record from to your sound card’s S/PDIF input using a 75 ohm coaxial video
cable or special S/PDIF cable. You may need to turn off the power on your computer, sound card, and sound source first. See
your sound card’s documentation.
2. Use your sound card’s mixer software to set its clock to external or S/PDIF.
3. Leave Cakewalk’s clock setting at the default choice, which is Audio. You can choose clock settings in Edit > Preferences >
Project - Clock or in the Control Bar’s Sync module.
4. Arm a track, test the input level and adjust input volume, and record your track.
5. When you’re finished recording, set your sound card’s clock back to internal, and listen to your recording.
There’s one more type of audio connection you may find on occasion called AES/EBU, which stands for Audio Engineering Society/
European Broadcasting Union, and is the highest bandwidth digital audio connection. An AES/EBU connection can use cables
longer than 33 feet, which is the limit for S/PDIF cables. If your sound source has an AES/EBU connection, you can use your sound
card’s S/PDIF jacks to send data to and from the AES/EBU jacks by purchasing an inexpensive converter, such as the Hosa CDL313 (www.hosatech.com).

Audio hardware (sound cards) and drivers
There are many different brands of sound cards on the market today. This section aims to help you get the best out of yours.
See:
“Consumer and professional” on page 237

Consumer and professional
There are many sound cards to choose from. Nearly every computer comes with one. Some are nationally known brands and others
are proprietary sound cards that are made specifically for a single manufacturer. These sound cards are called “consumer” cards.
They are designed to handle the general multimedia tasks most computer users have, like playing CDs or MP3s, using your
computer as a telephone, or playing computer games. Most consumer sound cards fit the bill nicely for the average computer user.
They can play and record both audio and MIDI, but there are certain limitations which are relevant for Cakewalk users. The following
list covers the characteristics of most consumer sound cards. This list is very general and does not necessarily reflect every sound
card that comes bundled with a computer.
Consumer grade sound card characteristics:

 Number of inputs and outputs. Consumer cards nearly always have two inputs, mic and line in, and one output. Usually, these
inputs and outputs are stereo, meaning there is a left and right channel.

 Type of inputs and outputs. Consumer cards almost always have eighth inch jacks, requiring an adapter to use with standard
quarter inch cables (guitar cables, patch cables, etc.).

 Simultaneous recording and playback. Some older consumer sound cards aren’t capable of simultaneous recording and
playback. These cards are called half-duplex. Cards that are capable of simultaneous recording a playback are called full-duplex.

 16-bit, 44100 resolution. Consumer cards are only capable of 16-bit audio and a sampling rate of 44.1 KHz. While these
settings are at CD quality, Cakewalk software is capable of 32-bit audio at a sampling rate of up to 192 KHz.

 Internal. Consumer sound cards are installed in PCI slots (or ISA for older sound cards) on your computer’s motherboard.
While professional sound cards are also frequently installed in PCI slots, some provide a “breakout box” which houses the analog
to digital (A to D) and digital to analog (D to A) converters, keeping them away from the internal noise a computer generates (fans,
hard drives, etc.).

Professional sound card characteristics:

 Multiple inputs and outputs. Many professional sound cards have multiple inputs and/or outputs. Some have analog and
digital inputs or outputs for use with ADATs and digital mixers.

 Type of inputs and outputs. Professional sound cards use quarter inch (mono or TRS), XLR or RCA inputs rather than the
eighth inch jacks found on consumer grade sound cards. Some cards also have digital inputs and/or outputs like S/PDIF and
ADAT.

 Higher bit-depths and sampling rates. Most newer professional sound cards allow you to record at 20, 22 or 24-bit, and at a
sampling rate of up to 96 KHz.

 Onboard DSP. Some sound cards have effects processors for things like reverb and delay built into the sound card. These can
take a big load off of your computer.

 High quality A to D and D to A converters (Analog to Digital and Digital to Analog). The quality of your recordings
ultimately depends on the quality of sound that you initially record. Professional sound cards have higher-quality components that
convert the sound into and back out of the digital format.

Installation and drivers
When you install a sound card, you are installing both the hardware and software called a driver. The sound card driver is what
allows your operating system and your sound card to communicate. This section is aimed at preventing problems when installing
both your sound card and its driver.

Installing a sound card
Follow your sound card’s documentation for installing the sound card in your computer. If you are installing a PCI card, or any
hardware that requires you to open the cover of your computer, be careful to discharge any static electricity you are carrying by
touching the metal casing of your computer before handling the sound card itself. Static electricity can damage a sound card’s
circuitry.

WDM and MME
In most situations, the newer WDM (Windows Driver Model) sound card drivers that most sound card vendors are creating are a
much better choice than the older MME (Multi-Media Extensions) drivers. If your sound card vendor has a WDM driver, it’s usually a
good idea use it. The following table compares their characteristics.
WDM

MME

Lower latency

Usually higher latency

Not every sound card vendor has produced a
WDM driver.

MME drivers are widely available.
Note: If you use two or more sound cards at the same time, and not all of them have WDM
drivers, you must force the WDM drivers to function as MME drivers. Go to Edit >
Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording and select MME in the Driver Mode list.

Cakewalk and audio hardware
The following tips will help you get the most out of your sound card and Cakewalk software:

 Use Cakewalk’s Wave Profiler anytime your install a new sound card. Wave Profiler determines the correct settings for your
sound card.

 Read the documentation for your sound card. You can save yourself a lot of time by learning about your hardware before
you try to use it. Many sound cards have their own control panels which allow you to customize the card’s settings.

About Cakewalk
Cakewalk has a comprehensive feature set that makes it the single most productive tool for sound and music authoring. Here are
some of the ways you can use Cakewalk.
Next topic: “Publish” on page 241

Publish
Publishing usually means printing your music; it’s one way to share your finished product with other performers. After you’ve
recorded and arranged a song in Cakewalk, you can produce printed lead sheets and small scores with lyrics for sharing. You can
also share the music files themselves. Cakewalk will save your music in a format that you can put on a website or email to other
people.

Music composition and exploration
Cakewalk is a powerful music-composition application, providing tools to record your own musical performances; enhance or
improve the quality of those performances; and edit, arrange, and experiment with the music. With a few simple clicks of the mouse,
you can arrange, orchestrate, and audition your composition. Fully integrated sequencing allows you to combine the convenience
and flexibility of MIDI composition with the high-quality sound and subtlety of digital audio sound recording and reproduction.
Change the feel of a piece by locking it to a musical groove, or add delicate delays, anticipations, or echoes that add richness to the
music.
Cakewalk displays and lets you edit your music using standard musical notation and guitar tablature, so you can adjust individual
notes, add performance markings, and print individual parts or full scores. You can graphically draw tempo and volume changes, or
add lyrics to display on-screen or to include with printed scores.
Next topic: “Remixing” on page 242.

Remixing
Cakewalk’s Groove clips allow you to import, create, export and edit loops, making it possible to quickly change tempos and keys for
an entire project. The Browser view lets you preview loops in the project’s tempo and key before dragging and dropping them onto a
track.

Introduction
About Cakewalk

Computers, sound and music
This section provides some background on the different ways that computers store and play sound and music. Computers work with
sound and music in two different forms: MIDI and digital audio.
Next topic: “MIDI” on page 244.

MIDI
MIDI (short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is the way computers communicate with most sound cards, keyboards, and
other electronic instruments. MIDI refers to both the type of cables and plugs used to connect the computers and instruments, and to
the language those computers and instruments use to talk to each other. The MIDI standard is accepted and used worldwide. Almost
any electronic instrument you buy today will have MIDI connectors and can be used with other MIDI instruments and with your
computer’s MIDI interface. To record MIDI in Cakewalk, you have to have a MIDI cable connecting the MIDI OUT port on your MIDI
instrument to a MIDI IN port on either your sound card or your MIDI interface. You must also make sure that you have installed the
software MIDI driver that came with your sound card or MIDI interface.
The MIDI language conveys information and instructions, both from the computer to the instrument and from the instrument to the
computer. For example, if your computer wants your keyboard to play a note, it sends a MIDI “Note On” message and tells the
keyboard which note to play. When your computer wants the keyboard to stop playing that note, it sends another message that stops
the note from playing.
The MIDI language has many other instructions, such as messages to change the sound that is used to play the notes (the bank and
patch), messages that enable working with the sustain pedal and the pitch-bend wheel, and others. By sending the right messages
at the right times, your computer can control your electronic instrument and make it play music.
MIDI information can be sent on 16 different channels. You can set up your MIDI equipment to listen for messages on all channels or
on only a few.
MIDI files contain all the MIDI messages and timing information that are needed to play a song. MIDI files can be read and played by
many different programs, including Cakewalk, and can even be played by programs on other types of computers. MIDI files have the
extension .mid.
There are several important advantages of the MIDI format:

 Large amounts of music can be stored in a very compact form
 Different parts of a piece can easily be assigned to any instrument you can imagine
 The music contains information on notes, tempos, and key signatures that makes it possible to display and edit the piece using
standard musical notation
The primary disadvantage of MIDI is that the quality of the sound a listener hears will vary depending on the MIDI equipment the
listener is using. For example, MIDI usually sounds much better on an expensive synthesizer than it does on an inexpensive sound
card.
Next topic: “Digital audio” on page 245.

Introduction
Computers, sound and music

Digital audio
Digital audio (frequently referred to here as just “audio”) is a simple way to record and play sounds of any type. It works like a tape
recorder—you record something, then later play it back. Digital audio stores the sound as a long series of numbers. To record audio
in Cakewalk, you have to have an audio cable connecting the audio output of your electronic instrument to the audio input on your
sound card or audio hardware. If you’re recording vocals or an acoustic instrument, you need to connect a microphone to the audio
input on your sound card or audio hardware.

Sound Waves
Sound waves are vibrations in the air. Sound waves are generated by anything that vibrates; a vibrating object causes the air next to
it to vibrate, and the vibration is passed through the air in all directions. When the vibrating air enters your ear, it makes your eardrum
vibrate, and you hear a sound. Likewise, if the vibrating air hits a microphone, it causes the microphone to vibrate and send electrical
signals to whatever it's connected to.
These vibrations are very fast. The slowest vibration frequency you can hear is about 20 vibrations per second, and the fastest is
around 16,000 to 20,000 vibrations per second.

Recording digital audio
To record digital audio, your computer monitors the electrical signal generated by a microphone, an electric guitar, or another source.
At equal intervals of time (for CD-quality sound, this means 44,100 times a second), the computer measures and saves the strength
of the electrical signal from the microphone, on a scale from 0 to 65,535.
That's it. Digital audio data is just a long series of numbers. The computer sends these numbers, in the form of electrical signals, to
a speaker. The speaker then vibrates and generates the same sound that was recorded.
The primary advantage of digital audio is the quality of the sound. Unlike MIDI, a digital audio recording is very rich, capturing all the
nuances, overtones, and other characteristics of the sound exactly as performed. The main drawback of digital audio is that it takes
up a lot of disk space. To record a 1-minute segment of stereo, CD-quality digital audio, you need about 10 megabytes of disk space.
On the computer, digital audio is usually stored in Wave files (extension .wav). There are many programs available that let you
create, play, and edit these files. Cakewalk reads, writes, and lets you edit Wave files.
Next topic: “Setup” on page 246

Introduction
Computers, sound and music

245

Setup
You can install Cakewalk on any computer that runs Windows 10 and has a sound card or built-in sound module. If you want to hook
up other devices, like a MIDI keyboard, an electric guitar, or a microphone, you need the right cables, and you need to find the right
connectors on your computer.
To connect a MIDI keyboard to your computer you will need a MIDI interface. Some sound cards include a built-in MIDI interface. If
your model does not, there are many options available at your local music store. Many of these will connect to your computer via
USB.
If you have a dedicated MIDI interface, lots of electronic music gear, or work with many different music software packages, see
“Hardware setup” on page 1449. Before you attach or detach any cables from your computer, you should shut down your computer
and turn off the power to all your equipment. This greatly reduces the chance of electrical damage to your equipment while plugging
and unplugging cables.

User accounts
Previous versions of Cakewalk required a user to have Windows Administrator status. This is no longer the case. Any level of user
can now install and run Cakewalk. Only one copy of Cakewalk per machine is necessary for multiple users to run Cakewalk with
each user’s personal settings.
When you first install Cakewalk, all application data files and .ini files are installed to the system-specified “all users” application data
folders:
C:\ProgramData\Cakewalk
When you launch Cakewalk for the first time, all content files (such as track templates and project templates) will be copied from the
global application data folder (All Users) to the user application data folder (User Account), before the program launches.
If you install a Cakewalk patch on top of the original installation, any updated content files in the patch will not overwrite existing
content files in your personal user application data folder. However, you can force Cakewalk to update the default content files in
your personal user data folder.
Warning: The following action will overwrite any Cakewalk data files such as track templates and project templates that you
may have customized. A message box will prompt you if you want to continue or cancel. Only proceed if you are certain that
you will not overwrite any important customized files.
To force Cakewalk to update and overwrite any default content files, hold down the CTRL key while starting Cakewalk. Data in the
Program Files folder will be common to all users.
Next topic: “Audio connections” on page 246

Audio connections
There are several types of audio interfaces (sound cards). CardBus (PCI), USB/USB2 and FireWire are the most common. Laptops
can use an audio PCMCIA card. Many audio interfaces also have MIDI inputs and some have built in MIDI synthesizers as well. This
section covers the various audio connection options.

Analog and digital Inputs
There are two basic types of audio inputs, analog and digital. Analog inputs allow you to connect a guitar, mic or other instrument to
your computer directly. The audio interface converts the analog input to digital. Digital inputs allow other digital devices to connect
directly to your computer. Common digital inputs include external analog to digital converters, popular guitar processors like the Line
6 POD, and other digital recording systems like the ADAT decks. Analog inputs are very common, and are standard in virtually all
consumer sound cards (the ones that come with your computer). Digital inputs are becoming more popular and are very common on
professional and mid-level, “prosumer” interfaces. Analog inputs allow you to record a mono or stereo signal (assuming you have a
stereo input) while digital inputs allow you to record 1 to 8 signals depending on the type of digital connection.

Introduction
Setup

MIDI connections
There are three types of MIDI cables in common use. Here’s how to connect each of the three types:

 USB cable. This is extremely common. Many electronic keyboards and stand-alone MIDI interfaces use this type of connection.
To use this type of connection, simply plug one end of the USB cable into the USB jack on your MDI keyboard or stand-alone MIDI
interface, and plug the other end into your computer. If you are using a stand-alone USB MIDI interface, you then need to connect
standard MIDI cables between your MIDI keyboard and your stand-alone MIDI interface (see the following procedure). If you
haven’t already installed the software MIDI driver that came with your keyboard or interface, make sure you do so.

 Standard MIDI cable. This is also very common. MIDI keyboards usually have jacks for these cables even if they have a USB
connection. You need two of these cables. To use this type of cable, use one cable to connect the MIDI OUT jack on your MIDI
instrument to the MIDI IN jack on your stand-alone MIDI interface or sound card, and one to connect the MIDI IN jack on your
MIDI instrument to the MIDI OUT jack on your stand-alone MIDI interface or sound card. Many stand-alone MIDI interfaces and
audio interfaces use this type of connector.
Note: If you are only using an external MIDI controller to trigger software instruments, you only need to connect a single MIDI
cable from the MIDI controller’s MIDI OUT jack to the MIDI IN jack on your MIDI interface.
Figure 71.

Standard MIDI cable—use this if your MIDI interface has standard 5-pin input and output ports.

 Joystick connector. This is becoming less common. This is the type of connection seen on older SoundBlaster type sound
cards. To use this type of connection, find the end of one of the MIDI cables that is labeled OUT. Plug this connector into the MIDI
IN jack on your electronic keyboard. The other 5-pin connector on the MIDI cable is labeled IN. Plug this connector into the MIDI
OUT jack on your electronic keyboard. Plug the 15-pin connector on the MIDI cable into the MIDI/joystick port on your sound card.
If you have a joystick, unplug it, plug in the MIDI cable, and plug the joystick into the pass-through connector on the MIDI cable.

Introduction
Setup

Changing I/O devices
You can add or remove USB/FireWire audio and MIDI devices while Cakewalk is running, and the audio and MIDI engines will
dynamically respond to any changes.
When a device is added or removed, Cakewalk prompts you to confirm or cancel the change. If you click Yes, playback stops and
the audio and MIDI engines reload.

Preserve selected audio devices on device changes
Enabled inputs and outputs are persisted per device and per driver mode. This prevents audio ports from shifting around and
causing unwanted devices to become selected as active audio inputs and outputs. You can add a device back at any time and
Cakewalk will remember the last set of enabled inputs and outputs for that device.
You can freely add or remove devices without impacting the current working set of enabled devices. Adding a device back will
remember its last selected inputs and outputs. You can also switch driver modes and the existing enabled devices will be
remembered for the next time when you switch back to that mode.

Loading a project after changing audio devices
When loading a project after changing audio devices, Cakewalk will attempt to automatically remap any missing device to an
equivalent new device. If an equivalent match is not found, the Missing Audio Outputs dialog box appears, allowing you to
manually reassign any unresolved output ports.
The Missing Audio Outputs dialog box will suggest default assignments for any missing devices. You can click OK to accept the
assignments, or click Cancel to preserve the original missing device assignments. You can also preserve the original missing device
by selecting [Unassigned] from the Available Devices list. If you choose not to reassign a missing device, the Output port
selection in Cakewalk will show the missing device name prefixed by MISSING.

Note: The Missing Audio Outputs dialog box is not shown if there is only a single missing output port and only one available
output port. In this case, Cakewalk will automatically assign the missing output port to the available output port.

Introduction
Setup

Remapping using friendly driver names
When Use friendly names to represent audio drivers is selected in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Devices, Cakewalk can
intelligently remap devices across different hardware configurations or driver models by using your assigned friendly driver names,
even if the hardware names do not match.
This can be very useful if you switch driver modes and load projects you worked on earlier in another driver mode, or if you
collaborate with other people who have different hardware configurations. As long as you set up friendly names that match, all
outputs will be automatically remapped.
Note: Remapping with friendly names takes precedence over the actual hardware device names.

Changing MIDI Output devices
Changing MIDI output ports in Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices has the following effect:

 Enabling a new output port. All MIDI tracks and control surfaces retain their current output port assignments.
 Disabling an unassigned output port. All MIDI tracks and control surfaces retain their current output port assignments.
 Disabling an assigned output port. The result is different for MIDI tracks and control surfaces:
 MIDI tracks. The Missing MIDI Ports dialog box appears and lets you remap the missing output ports to available output
ports.
Note: If you do not remap a missing device, the track’s Output control will display MISSING: <name of missing device>. If the
missing device becomes available in the future, the track will automatically be assigned to the correct device.

 Control surfaces. The control surface output port is assigned to None.
Figure 73.

The Missing MIDI Ports dialog box lets you remap missing output devices.

Figure 74.

A track’s Output control shows the name of the missing device.

Opening projects after MIDI configuration has changed
If any assigned MIDI output devices are missing when you load a project, which is likely to happen if you transfer projects between
different computers, Cakewalk will do the following:

 MIDI tracks. The Missing MIDI Ports dialog box appears and lets you remap the missing devices to available devices.
Note: If you do not remap a missing devices, the track’s Output control will display MISSING: <name of missing device>. If the
missing device becomes available in the future, the track will automatically be assigned to the correct device.

 Control surfaces. Control surface output ports are assigned to None.

Automatic MIDI port remapping for control surfaces
Cakewalk persists the names of MIDI ports that are assigned to control surfaces. This ensures that the correct MIDI ports are
assigned to control surfaces, even if you add or remove other MIDI devices.

Starting Cakewalk
There are many different ways to start Cakewalk. Here are a few:

 Double-click the Cakewalk by BandLab icon on your desktop.
 Click the Start button, and choose Programs > Cakewalk > Cakewalk by BandLab.
 Click the Start button, point to Documents, and choose a Cakewalk project from the menu.

Introduction
Starting Cakewalk

Migrating preferences
If you have a previous version of Cakewalk installed, Cakewalk will detect it and give you the option of migrating certain preferences
from a single earlier version.
When you choose to migrate preferences, Cakewalk migrates the following settings from an earlier Cakewalk version.
Setting

Description

Global Options

Global settings in the Preferences dialog box. Open by selecting Edit > Preferences.

Key Bindings

Your customized key bindings for controlling Cakewalk using your MIDI keyboard or computer
keyboard.

Instrument Definitions

Files used to control specific MIDI instruments.

Audio data directory (WaveData folder) and
Picture Cache directory locations

Cakewalk uses the Data directory and Picture Cache directories from the previous Cakewalk
version for storing project wave files and their waveform image files.

Running Wave Profiler
The first time you start Cakewalk, it automatically attempts to detect and configure any ASIO audio devices on your computer. If no
ASIO devices are found, it next attempts to detect any MME audio devices, then automatically runs the Wave Profiler utility to
determine the proper MIDI and Audio settings for your audio device.
When the Wave Profiler determines the kind of card you have, always accept the default settings. You can run the Wave Profiler
again if you install a new audio device or driver by choosing Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings in Cakewalk and clicking
the Wave Profiler button (or ASIO Panel button if you are using an ASIO audio device).
For more information about Wave Profiler, WDM, and MME, see “The Wave Profiler” on page 1356.
When Wave Profiler determines the kind of card you have, always accept the default settings.
Note: You can run the Wave Profiler again at a later time (for example, if you install a new sound card or driver) by choosing
the Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings command and clicking Wave Profiler.

Setting up the MIDI In and MIDI Out devices
When you start Cakewalk for the first time, it checks your computer to find all the MIDI input and output devices you have installed
(such as sound cards and MIDI interfaces). However, sometimes you need to tell Cakewalk exactly which devices you want it to use.
If you’re not getting sound from your sound card or MIDI keyboard, or if you just want to change the MIDI outputs and devices that
you are using, follow the steps in this section.
1. Choose Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices to open a dialog box in which you select the MIDI In and MIDI Out devices that
Cakewalk will use. Each item in the list is a MIDI Input or MIDI Output from drivers installed using the Windows Control Panel.
Select Edit > Preferences to open the Preferences dialog box, then click MIDI - Devices. This dialog box lets you choose
instruments on MIDI inputs and outputs.

Figure 76.

The MIDI - Devices section.

2. Look at the top window. Notice that it shows devices on MIDI Inputs; make sure that all devices in this window are checked. If a
device isn’t checked, click on it once to select it for MIDI Input.
3. Look at the window on the bottom. Notice that it shows devices on MIDI Outputs. Cakewalk numbers its MIDI Outputs by the
order of the devices in this window. The device on top is on Output 1, the one below it is on Output 2, and so on.
4. Check one device at a time in the Outputs window and click Move Checked Output Devices to Top to change its order. Then
check all the devices that appear in the window to select them for output.
Tip: Be sure to select MIDI output devices in Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices. If you don’t do this, you won’t hear any of your
MIDI instruments when you play songs in Cakewalk. You do not need to enable any MIDI output devices if you are strictly using
software instruments.
See “MIDI - Devices” on page 1674.

Using MIDI devices after making driver changes
If you later add or remove drivers using the Drivers icon of the Windows Control Panel, Cakewalk reacts in the following way:

 If you remove a Control Panel driver, Cakewalk will not use the device it belongs to the next time you run the program. Any other
devices you had selected using the Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices command will remain selected.

 If you add a driver through the Control Panel, Cakewalk does not automatically use it. You must use the Edit > Preferences >
MIDI - Devices command to enable the new driver in Cakewalk’s list.
Note: After you add or remove a driver with the Drivers icon in the Windows Control Panel, you must restart Windows for the
change to take effect.

Defining your MIDI instrument or sound card
Once you have selected your MIDI Input and Output devices, Cakewalk, by default, plays back MIDI sequences using a General
MIDI instrument definition. If you are using a synthesizer or sound card that does not adhere to the General MIDI standard, you may
want to define that instrument. For more information, see “Instrument definitions” on page 1309.

Introduction
Starting Cakewalk

Cakewalk basics
Cakewalk’s menus and tools give you quick access to all the features of Cakewalk. Some menu choices and tools display dialog
boxes that let you choose among various options, or type in the values you want. If you click in most views, in Time Rulers, or on
certain other items with the right mouse button, you see a pop-up menu that provides quick access to many common operations.
The project is the center of your work in Cakewalk. If you’re a musician, a project might contain a song, a jingle, or a movement of a
symphony. If you’re a post-production engineer, a project might contain a 30-second radio commercial or a lengthy soundtrack for a
film or videotape production. By default, every project is stored in a file (known as a project file). The normal file extension for a
Cakewalk work file is .cwp.
Cakewalk organizes the sound and music in your project into tracks, clips, and events.
Tracks are used to store the sound or music made by each instrument or voice in a project. For example, a song that is arranged for
four instruments and one vocalist may have 5 tracks—one for each instrument and one for the vocals. Each project can have an
unlimited number of tracks. Some of these tracks may be used in your finished project, while others can hold alternate takes, backup
tracks, and variations that you might want to keep for future use. Each track can be made up of one or many clips.
Clips are the pieces of sound and music that make up your tracks. A clip might contain a horn solo, a drum break, a bass or guitar
riff, a voice-over, a sound effect like the hoot of an owl, or an entire keyboard performance. A track can contain a single clip or
dozens of different clips, and you can easily move clips from one track to another.
Groove clips are audio clips which have tempo and pitch information embedded within them, allowing them to follow changes to the
project tempo or project pitch. You can click on either edge of a Groove clip and drag out repetitions in the track.
Events are MIDI data (in MIDI tracks) or automation data.
See:
“Cakewalk file types” on page 255
“Opening a file” on page 256
“Views” on page 256
“Working on a project” on page 269

Cakewalk file types
Projects in Cakewalk can be saved as a project file with the extension .cwp or as a Bundle file with the extension .cwb. For a
complete description of the differences between project files and bundle files, see “Project files and bundle Files” on page 1349.

Other types of files
Cakewalk lets you create and work with several other types of files, in addition to project (.cwp) and bundle (.cwb) files that store
your projects.

File type

Description

MIDI files (extension .mid)

Standard MIDI files.

Template files (extension .tpl)

Templates for new files you create

Opening a file
Use the following procedure to open a file.

To open a file in Cakewalk
1. If you haven't already done so, start Cakewalk.
2. Choose File > Open.
3. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the directory where the project you want to open is located and select it.
4. Click the Open button.
5. If you are opening an OMF file, the Unpack OMF dialog box appears. Set the initial tempo and specify the directory where you
want to save the file and its audio. For more information about opening OMF files, see “Unpack OMF dialog” on page 1759.
Cakewalk loads the project.
See:
“Working on a project” on page 269
“I can’t open my project / File Recovery mode” on page 1442

Views
Cakewalk displays your project in windows on the screen that are known as views. You can have many views open at once, all
showing the same project. When you edit a project in one view, the other related views are updated automatically.

The Track view
Track view is the main window that you use to create, display, and work with a project. When you open a project file, Cakewalk
displays the Track view for the project. When you close the Track view for a project, Cakewalk closes the file.
The Track view is divided into several sections: menu bar (at the top), the Navigator pane, the Video Thumbnails pane, the Track
pane, the Inspector pane, the Clips pane, the Bus pane, the Browser pane, and the MultiDock.

PAGE UP

Moves the focus to the first track.

HOME

Moves the focus to the last track.

END

The Clips pane shows the clips in your project on a horizontal timeline called the Time Ruler that helps you visualize how your
project is organized. Clips contain markings that indicate their contents. The Clips pane lets you select, move, cut and copy clips
from place to place to change the arrangement of music and sound in your project.
The Bus pane shows the buses in the project, and also shows any editing views that are in tabbed (docked) format. The Show/Hide
Bus pane button

allows you to show or hide the Bus pane at the bottom of the Track view.

The Navigator pane displays a large part of your project so you can see an overview of your song. The Navigator pane displays all
of your project’s tracks.
The Track view makes it easy to select tracks, clips, and ranges of time in a project.
For more information, see “Track view” on page 1787 and “Configuring the display of tracks in the Track view” on page 484.

Introduction
Cakewalk basics

The Inspector pane appears to the left of the Track view, but can also be moved to the right side. There are three separate
inspectors:

 Track Inspector. The Track Inspector shows mix settings for the current track, bus, or main, and is essentially identical to a
channel strip in the Console view. Advanced MIDI settings are also available for MIDI tracks and Instrument tracks. For details,
see “Track Inspector overview” on page 695.

 Properties Inspector. The Properties Inspector shows properties for the selected clip(s) or track(s). For details, see “Properties
Inspector overview” on page 707. The Properties Inspector has several modes:

 Clip. The Clip Properties Inspector displays settings for the currently selected clip(s). For details, see “Properties Inspector Clip Properties” on page 708.

 Track. The Track Properties Inspector lets you type a track name, specify an audio track’s stretch modes, specify the default
clip colors, and enter a text description. For details, see “Properties Inspector - Track Properties” on page 713.

 Bus. The Bus Properties Inspector lets you type a bus name, specify the automation write mode and time base, and enter a
text description. For details, see “Properties Inspector - Bus Properties” on page 715

 ProChannel. ProChannel combines compression, equalization, and tube saturation modeling in one convenient processor.
ProChannel is available on each audio track, Instrument track and bus. For details, see “ProChannel” on page 1081.
For more information about the Inspector pane, see “Inspectors” on page 691.

Control Bar
Much of your time in Cakewalk is spent recording and listening to your project as it develops. The Control Bar contains the most
important tools and other pieces of information you will need to record, edit and play back your project.
The Control Bar consists of several modules that each contain various related controls. You can re-arrange and show/hide each
individual module, which allows you to only show the functions you need most often. By default, the Control Bar is docked at the top
of Cakewalk’s screen, but can also be undocked or docked at the bottom.
Figure 79.

The Control Bar.

For more information about the Control Bar, see “Control Bar overview” on page 647.

The Console view
The Console view is where you can mix the sounds on all the different tracks to create the final mix of your project. While the Track
view provides most of the same controls, you may want to use the more familiar interface of the Console view for mixing. You use
the Console view to adjust the levels of sound for the different tracks in your project, to change the stereo panning, and to apply realtime effects to an individual track, combinations of tracks, or the final mix.
The Console view contains several modules of controls. There is one channel strip for each track and bus in your project. You can
use bus sends to direct certain tracks to special modules that are known as buses.

Other views
Cakewalk has a number of other views you can use to display and work on your project. To display these view, choose the desired
view from the Views menu, or press the view’s keyboard shortcut.
The Piano Roll view shows the notes from a MIDI track or tracks as they would appear on a player-piano roll. You can move the
notes around, make them longer or shorter, and change their pitches by just dragging them with the mouse. You can also use the
Piano Roll view to display and edit MIDI velocity, controllers, and other types of information. The Piano Roll view also contains the
Drum Editor, which allows you to play different drum modules from a single track. For more information, see “Piano Roll view” on
page 1796.

Locking views
By default Cakewalk allows only one instance of each view, but you can lock the contents of most views, preserving the current view
by forcing a new instance of the view to appear if necessary. Locking views is the only way you can have multiple instances of the
same view open. Only the Track and Console views cannot be locked.
To lock a view, do one of the following:

 Click the upper left corner of a window, and choose Lock Contents from the pop-up menu.
 If the view is docked in the MultiDock, right-click the view’s tab and choose Lock Contents.
For more information about locking view, see “Locking views” on page 1247.

Introduction
Cakewalk basics

Floating views
When a view is float enabled, you can move it outside of the confines of Cakewalk. This is particularly useful if you take advantage
of Cakewalk’s dual monitor support. Using dual monitor support, you can keep the Track or Console view on one monitor and “float”
other views to the other monitor by dragging them to the second screen.
For more information about floating view, see “Floating views and using dual video monitors” on page 1246.

X-Ray windows
The X-Ray Windows feature eliminates the need to constantly minimize, move, or close windows in order to work in other windows.
It works by decreasing the opacity of the current window enough so that you can see and work with the window that’s behind the
current window. You activate the feature by pressing a keyboard shortcut (default shortcut is SHIFT+X) when the mouse cursor is
over a window you want to x-ray. You can choose to X-Ray whichever window is underneath the mouse cursor, or automatically XRay all FX/synth property pages in one step (Note: the mouse cursor does not need to be over any plug-in property pages).
The X-Ray Windows feature works on the following windows:

 AudioSnap palette
 Piano Roll view (when float-enabled)
 Plug-in effects and synths
 Controller/Surface plug-ins
To select key bindings for X-Ray windows
1. Use the Edit > Preferences command to open the Preferences dialog box, then select Keyboard Shortcuts.
2. If you want to use currently unassigned keys or key combinations, scroll through the options in the Key window until the
Assigned to field that is just under the window reads Unassigned. It’s a good idea to find two unassigned options that are next
to each other or easy to remember.
Note: For best results with X-Ray Windows, avoid using ALT key combinations.

3. Once you’ve decided on two keys or key combinations that you want to use, select Global Bindings in the Area field, and scroll to
the bottom of the list of commands that are in the window below that field.
4. In the Key window, highlight the key or key combination that you want to use for the X-Ray command, then highlight X-Ray in the
function column of the list of commands, then click the Bind button to bind them together.
5. Now highlight the key or key combination that you want to use for the X-Ray All FX/Synths command, then highlight X-Ray All
FX/Synths in the function column of the list of commands, then click the Bind button to bind them together.
6. Click OK to close the dialog box.
To use X-Ray windows
1. Use the Edit > Preferences command to open the Preferences dialog box, click Customization - Display and make sure the
Enable X-Ray check box is selected.
2. Make sure that the view windows you want to X-Ray are in the Floating-enabled state: to check this, click the view or fx icon
that’s in the upper left corner of a window, and select Enable Floating from the drop-down menu. If Disable Floating is in the
menu, then the Floating option is already enabled.
Note: All FX/Synth/Control surface property pages are float-enabled by default.

3. To X-Ray or un-X-Ray a single window, move the mouse cursor over the window, and press the keyboard shortcut (default is
SHIFT+X) for the X-Ray command. The window does not need to have focus (does not need to be the highlighted window).
4. To X-Ray or un-X-Ray all plug-in windows at once, press the key binding for the X-Ray All FX/Synths command.
Note: If a window has focus, and the window’s Give All Keystrokes To Plug-in button
commands won’t work.

To Adjust X-Ray Windows Options
1. Use the Edit > Preferences command to open the Preferences dialog box, then click Customization - Display.
2. On the General tab, you can adjust these options:

 Enable X-Ray. Enable or disable this check box to turn the X-Ray Windows feature on or off.
 Opacity. Adjust this value by typing in a value, or by clicking and holding the + or - button to adjust the final opacity
percentage value that an X-Rayed window reaches.

 Fade Out Time. Adjust this value by typing in a value, or by clicking and holding the + or - button to adjust the amount of
time that an X-Rayed window takes to reach its final opacity percentage value.

 Fade In Time. Adjust this value by clicking and holding the + or - button to adjust the amount of time that an X-Rayed
window takes to restore its original opacity.
3. Click OK to close the dialog box and accept your changes.
To exclude a plug-in from X-Ray capability
Some plug-ins (very few) use DirectDraw to create their windows. These windows appear jittery when x-rayed.
To exclude a plug-in from X-Ray capability, follow these steps:
1. Open the Cakewalk Plug-in Manager: use the Utilities > Cakewalk Plug- in Manager command.
2. In the Plug-in Categories window, select the category that the plug-in you want to exclude is in.
3. In the Registered Plug-ins window, select the plug-in that you want to exclude.
4. If the plug-in is a DirectX effect or an MFX, write down (or select and copy) the CLSID value that’s in the CLSID field at the
bottom of the dialog box.
5. If the plug-in is a VST or VSTi, write down the VST ID value that’s in the VST ID field at the bottom of the dialog box.
6. Close the Plug-in Manager dialog box.
7. Open the Xrayexclude.ini file that’s in your Cakewalk program folder (use Notepad).
8. At the end of the file, find the [EffectProps View] section.
You will see entries such as the following:
; Waves SSL EQ Stereo
XRayExclude11=1397510483
XRayExclude12={E451379E-F7E1-4E82-98D9-BEB87AC45E90}
9. Exclude your plug-in by creating a blank line below the last entry in the [EffectProps View] section, and then typing:
;[name of your plug-in, but without brackets]
XRayExclude[type the next available number in XRayExclude list, but without brackets]=[VST ID number, with no brackets, or
CLSID number, with curly braces at start and finish]
For example, if the last entry in the [EffectProps View] section was:; Waves SSL EQ Stereo
XRayExclude11=1397510483
XRayExclude12={E451379E-F7E1-4E82-98D9-BEB87AC45E90}
If you want to exclude the Sonitus:fx Delay from the X-Ray Windows feature, after creating a blank line, type:
; Sonitus:fx Delay
XRayExclude13={C54E2D80-F9CA-11D2-8C30-00805FE9FC03}
If there was also a VST version of the Sonitus:fx Delay, you would add another line:
XRayExclude14=[some VST ID number, with no brackets]
10. Save and close the Xrayexclude.ini file, and restart Cakewalk to implement your changes.

Screensets
You may spend a lot of time making sure that all the views are laid out on the screen just the way you want. When you save your
work, Cakewalk automatically saves the screen layout along with it. You can create up to 10 screensets per project and freely switch
between screensets at any time.
For more information, see “Screensets” on page 1250.
Next topic: “Working on a project” on page 269.

Working on a project
Every project has a current time, known as the Now time (see: “The Now time and how to use it” on page 282). As you record or play
back a project, the Now time shows your current location in the project. When you create a project, the Now time is set to the
beginning of the project. The current Now time is saved with your project.
As you work with a project, you can use Cakewalk’s mute and solo features to choose which tracks are played, or you can create
loops to play a particular section over and over again. You can also create markers, which are named time points you add to your
project to make it easy to jump to a particular location.
Next topic: “Cakewalk file types” on page 255.

Color presets
Once you create a color arrangement that you like, you can save it as a preset, and then load it whenever you want to use that
arrangement. You can also load any of the many factory presets, some of which duplicate the colors of earlier versions of Cakewalk.
You can also import and export color arrangements in the form of .clr files so that Cakewalk users can share color layouts. And you
can back up or export all of your presets with a single command, and import a group of presets that you or another Cakewalk user
created.
Note: Both single color presets, and collections of presets use the file extension .clr, so when you export either the current color
arrangement, or all of your presets at once, give the exported file a name that clearly labels it as either a single preset, or as a
collection of presets.

Activating Cakewalk
Activation is the process by which Cakewalk validates that your software is genuine and being used in accordance with the license
agreement. Cakewalk can be activated by an online or offline process.
Saving and exporting are disabled until Cakewalk is activated.
A toast notification appears at the bottom of the screen to inform you if Cakewalk has not been activated yet. If your computer is
connected to the internet, go to Help > Refresh Activation.
In order to automatically keep your activation status up to date, Cakewalk will renew your activation status whenever a new version
of the application is installed and run for the first time, and when you sign in to BandLab from within Cakewalk. If you have never
signed in to BandLab from within Cakewalk, you will be prompted once to sign in.
You will see a “Cakewalk activation has been refreshed” message on starting the application for the first time. If you were not signed
in to BandLab, you will be prompted to sign in, after which it will auto renew the activation status. Note that you must have an active
internet connection for the automatic renewal process to work.
As long as you stay logged in to BandLab within Cakewalk, and use Cakewalk occasionally, it will automatically stay activated with
no further user intervention required.

Offline activation
If Cakewalk is installed on a computer that is not connected to the internet, you can use offline activation as long as you have access
to another computer that is connected to the internet. To use offline activation, follow these steps:
1. In Cakewalk, go to Help > Offline Activation > Export Activation Request to open the Save activation request dialog box.
2. Select the folder you want to save the activation request file to, then click Save.
Cakewalk saves a Activation request.crq file. This file is encrypted and machine-specific, and can only be used to
activate Cakewalk on the machine that was originally used to create the Activation request.crq file.
By default, Cakewalk appends a timestamp to the file name, using the following format:
<Month><Day><Year>_<Hour><Minute>. For example: 032820_1157Activation request.crq.
3. Copy the Activation request.crq file to removable media, such as a USB flash drive, that you can transfer to another
computer that is connected to the internet.
4. Using an online computer, open BandLab Assistant and sign in with your BandLab ID and password.
5. Click the Apps tab.

Introduction
Installing Cakewalk

Controlling playback

When you play your Cakewalk project, you have full control over the tempo or speed of playback, which tracks are played, which
sound cards or other devices are used to produce the sound, and what the tracks sound like. You can access all of the playback
functions from the Control Bar (see “Control Bar overview” on page 647).
Cakewalk’s multi-MIDI enhancements give you the ability to play multiple synths or tracks from a single keyboard or controller, or let
multiple performers play the same or different tracks. You have total control over MIDI echo (MIDI echo refers to where MIDI input
signals are sent once Cakewalk receives them).
Note: Cakewalk has a button called the Audio Engine button
in the Control Bar’s Transport module, which you click to stop
any feedback you may experience if there is a loop somewhere in your mixer setup. Whenever you play a project, Cakewalk
automatically enables the audio engine.

The Now time and how to use it
Every project has a current time, known as the “Now time” on page 1913, which keeps track of where you are in a project. The Now
time appears as a vertical line in the Track view and is displayed in the Transport module in the Control Bar (see “Transport module”
on page 663).
Figure 92.

The Transport module in the Control Bar.

C

A. Current Now time (click to cycle through the available display formats) B. Position C. Meter

The Transport module can show the Now time in several formats. Click the time display to toggle between the following time formats:

 MBT. Display time as Measure:Beat:Tick.
 HMSF. Display time as Hour:Minute:Second:Frame. This format is also referred to as SMPTE time.
 Milliseconds. Display time in milliseconds.
 Samples. Display time in samples.
The measure, beat, and tick number (MBT) identifies the Now time in musical time units. Ticks are subdivisions of quarter notes and
indicate the timebase of the project. For more information about the timebase, see “Setting the MIDI timing resolution” on page 351.
Here are some examples of times expressed in measure, beat, and tick (MBT) format:
Time

What it means

1:01:000

First beat of the first measure

9:04:000

Fourth beat of the ninth measure

4:02:060

The 60th tick of the second beat of the fourth measure

The hours-minutes-seconds-frames format is commonly referred to as the SMPTE time. SMPTE is the acronym for the Society of
Motion Picture and Television Engineers. In this format, time is measured in hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. It’s not necessary
for a project to begin at time zero in this format—any time can be used to represent the start of a project. If you are synchronizing
Cakewalk with an external device whose start time is not 0, you must offset Cakewalk to match the external device’s start time. For
more information, see “Synchronizing your gear” on page 1335.
Here are some examples of times expressed in this format (assuming that zero is the start time):
Time

What it means

00:00:00:00

The beginning of the project

00:05:10:00

Five minutes and ten seconds from the beginning of the project

01:30:00:00

One hour and thirty minutes into the project

00:00:00:05

Five frames into the project

Cakewalk provides many ways to set the Now time. Here are just a few:

282

Controlling playback
The Now time and how to use it

To change the Now time
 Click the desired time on the Time Ruler in the Track view, Piano Roll view, or Staff view.
 In the Navigator pane, click anywhere in the view while holding down the CTRL key to change the Now Time to that location.
 Drag the Position slider in the Transport module.
 Click the transport buttons in the Transport module.
 Click on an event in the Event List view.
You can also set the Now time by right-clicking in the Clips pane if you enable the Right Click Sets Now option in Track view
Options > Click Behavior menu.
When entering a time in MBT format, the beat and tick values are optional. You can use a colon, space, decimal point, or vertical bar
to separate the parts of the Now time:
You enter

The Now time is set to

2

2:01:000

420

4:02:000

9

9:01:000

5|1:30

5:01:030

When entering a time in SMPTE format, you can enter a single number (hour), two numbers (hour and minutes), three numbers
(hour, minutes, and seconds), or all four numbers.
If you click in the Time Ruler while the snap grid is enabled, the Now time will be snapped to the nearest point in the grid. By setting
the grid size to a whole note or quarter note, you can easily set the Now time to a measure or beat boundary.
Note: The Time Ruler only obeys snap when Musical Time or Absolute Time is selected in the Control Bar’s Snap module.

When playback or recording is stopped, the Now Time either remains at the point where the project stopped or snaps back to the
Now Time Marker. This behavior is specified with the Track view Options > On stop, Rewind to Now Marker command (or by
pressing CTRL+W). For more information, see “The Now time marker” on page 284.

MIDI note will continue to play If Now time is moved
Changing the Now time while a MIDI note is sounding will cause Cakewalk to play the full duration of the note. This behavior was
introduced in Cakewalk 4.0.3, and is necessary as a result of addressing various gapping issues when editing MIDI data during
playback.
If you prefer a slight hiccup instead of hearing the full note duration, you can change the default behavior with the Set Now Time
with Full Restart option in the Track view Options menu.
Note: Moving a MIDI note event during playback is affected by this same issue.

283

The Now time marker
In the Track view, the Now time appears as a solid vertical line that follows playback. When you set the Now time in the Track view,
the Now time marker appears in the Time Ruler. This marker represents the point at which the Now time will snap back to after you
stop playback or recording.
Figure 93.

The Now Time marker.

You can drag the Now Time marker during playback. When the mouse button is released, the transport immediately jumps to the
new location.
Note: You can only drag the Now Time marker during playback, not while recording.

The Now Time marker changes appearance to indicate if playback is stopped, paused, running, or recording.
Figure 94.

You can change the Now time marker behavior so that the marker moves to the current Now time when playback or recording is
stopped (on the Track view Options menu, clear the On Stop, Rewind to Now Marker option or press CTRL+W).

Note: If the various editing views do not scroll during playback, and the Now Time Marker disappears off-screen, make sure the
SCROLL LOCK key on your computer keyboard is not enabled.

To change the Now time marker behavior
On the Track view Options menu, clear the On Stop, Rewind to Now Marker option to have the Now time marker move to follow
the current Now time when you stop playback.

Controlling playback
The Now time and how to use it

Controlling the transport
To control playback, you have your choice of tools, menu commands, and shortcut keys for most common operations.
When you start playback, the Now time updates continuously to show the current time. When you stop playback, the Now time
rewinds to the Now Time Marker. When you start playback again, it continues from the same point.
If the Now time is advancing but you don’t hear any sound, see “Frequently asked questions” on page 1419. If you are using MIDI
sync or syncing to MIDI time code, Cakewalk waits to receive external timing data before it begins playing. If the various views are
not updating during playback, make sure the SCROLL LOCK key on your computer keyboard is not enabled. For more information,
see “Synchronizing your gear” on page 1335.
Note: If your Windows setup uses any system sounds that are associated with any typical activity, such as minimizing a window,
etc., you should disable these sounds. They can sound extremely loud through your monitors, and also interrupt playback and
recording, if you open any dialog boxes or do anything that has a system sound attached to it while a project plays. The quickest
way to disable all system sounds is to open the Control Panel (Start > Control Panel), double-click the Sound icon to open
the Sound dialog box, click the Sounds tab, and in the Sound Scheme field select No Sounds. Click Apply, and then click OK.

Allow playback with no data
Cakewalk is able to start playback even if there is no data in a project. This is useful in various cases, such as:

 If you need to trigger playback of external devices.
 If you need to continue playback beyond the end of the project, for example, to allow MIDI notes and sustains to decay naturally
and not end abruptly.
To allow playback with no data:
On the Track view Options menu, make sure Stop at Project End is not selected.

Stop at Project End option
The Track view Options > Stop at Project End option determines whether or not playback is allowed beyond the last event in a
project. This option is enabled by default.
When enabled (default setting):

 Playback will not engage if there is no data present in the project at all.
 Playback will stop when no more data is present going forward.
When disabled:

 Playback will engage if there is no data present in the project at all.
 Playback will continue past the end of a project until the user manually stops playback.
Auto fade when starting/stopping playback
Cakewalk makes it possible to render a smooth fade in/out whenever audio playback is interrupted. This can be useful to smooth out
abrupt transitions while stopping and starting the transport rapidly and will reduce ear fatigue during long sessions.
The fade is only applied during playback and is ignored while recording or bouncing audio.

To configure the auto fade times
1. Select Edit > Preferences to open the Preferences dialog box, then click Audio - Playback and Recording.
2. Adjust the following options:

 Fade On Start (milliseconds). When this option is set to a value greater than zero, starting playback will cause a gradual
fade in of the audio for the specified duration. The valid range is 0–100000 and the default value is 0.

 Fade On Stop (milliseconds). When this option is set to a value greater than zero, stopping playback will cause a gradual
fade out of the audio for the specified duration. The valid range is 0–100000 and the default value is 0.

Handling stuck notes
Under MIDI, the events that turn notes on are separate from the events that stop notes from playing. Normally, when you stop
playback, Cakewalk attempts to turn off all notes that are still playing. Depending on how your equipment is configured, it’s possible
for notes to get stuck in the On position. The Reset MIDI and Audio button
in the Transport module is used to stop all notes from
playing. The Reset MIDI and Audio command also stops feedback from input monitoring.
Note: You can control the MIDI messages that are sent by the Reset MIDI and Audio button
by changing the Panic
Strength variable in the Cakewalk.ini file. See “Initialization files” on page 1459 for more information.

To clear stuck notes
Click the Reset MIDI and Audio button

in the Transport module.

See:
“Transport module” on page 663

Looping
Sometimes you want to listen to one portion of a project over and over, either so you can play along and rehearse or because you
want to edit that section of the project while it is playing and hear the results as you make changes. Cakewalk has a playback
looping feature that makes this simple.
Looping is defined in the Loop module in the Control Bar.
Figure 99.

To set up a loop, you do three things:

 Set the start time of the loop
 Set the end time of the loop

From then on, Cakewalk will automatically jump back to the start of the loop when it reaches the end.
When looping is enabled, the loop times are indicated by special markers in the Time ruler.

To move a loop in the Time ruler
1. Click the yellow bar that connects the two loop markers
The cursor becomes a horizontal double-headed arrow.
2. Drag the loop to the desired location in the Time ruler.
With the default option settings, Cakewalk will play the loop over and over again, continuously.
If you start playback before the loop start time, Cakewalk will play until the loop end time is reached, then jump back to the loop start
time.
Note: If you stop playback while looping is enabled, the Now time jumps to the Now time marker. If you disable the On Stop,
Rewind to Now Marker option in the Track view Options menu, the Now time stays wherever you stopped playback.
The Rewind command operates slightly differently when looping is in effect. The first time you rewind, the Now time is set to the start
of the loop. If the Now time is already at the start of the loop, Rewind takes you to the beginning of the project. From then on, Rewind
switches back and forth between the loop start time and the start of measure 1.

To set up a playback loop
 Set the loop start and end times in one of the following ways:
 Drag the mouse between two points in the Time Ruler of the Track view, Staff, or Piano Roll view to select a range of times,
then click

in the Control Bar’s Loop module to copy the selection time to the loop time.

 Click between two markers in the Track, Staff, or Piano Roll view to select a range of times, then click
Loop module to copy the selection time to the loop time.

 Type the loop start and end times directly into the Loop module.
 Select a range of times, then right-click in the Time ruler and choose Loop > Set Loop Points.
Looping is automatically turned on when you use the Set Loop to Selection command.

Note: The minimum loop duration is an 1/8th note.

To cancel a playback loop

Track-by-track playback
Cakewalk lets you play back any combination of tracks at one time by changing each track’s status. You can control the status of
each track with the individual controls that are on every track, or with the global controls in the Control Bar’s Mix module. For more
information about the Mix module, see “Mix module” on page 666.

There are several different status settings for each track:
Status

What it means

Normal

The track plays unless one or more of your other tracks is soloed.

Muted

The track is not played, but you can turn it on while playback is in progress.

Archived

The track is not played, and you must stop playback to re-enable it. Archived tracks do not tax your
CPU during playback so they can be used to store alternate takes.

Soloed

Only those tracks that are designated as solo tracks are played; all others are muted.

Armed

The track is armed for recording.

Mono/Stereo (audio tracks only)

The track plays back in either mono or stereo.

Phase normal or inverted (audio tracks only)

If a track was accidentally recorded out of phase with another track, the Phase button in the Track
view or Track Inspector lets you reverse the phase of a track.

While playback is in progress, you can mute and unmute tracks in any combination, which means you can hear only the tracks that
you want. You can change the status of a track in the Track view, the Console view, the Track Inspector, or the Mix module in the
Control Bar. If a track is both muted and soloed, it does not play. Mute has precedence.
The track status is saved with the Cakewalk project file. If you save a Cakewalk project as a standard MIDI File, however, all tracks
are saved without mute, solo, or archive indicators.

Silencing tracks
When a track is muted, Cakewalk processes the track while playback is in progress so that you can unmute the track without
stopping playback. If you have lots of muted tracks, this can place a heavy load on your computer. Archived tracks, on the other
hand, don’t place any load on your computer. Therefore, if there are tracks you want to keep but don’t need to play, you should
archive them instead. When you mute or unmute a track while playback is in progress, there may be a slight delay before you hear
the effect of the change. This is to be expected and does not indicate a hardware or software problem.

To mute or unmute individual tracks
 To mute or unmute a track, click its Mute button

in the Track, Console view or Track Inspector.

 To mute or unmute several tracks at once, select the tracks and do one of the following:
 Right-click a track strip and choose MSR > Mute on the pop-up menu.
 To mute all selected tracks of the same track type, hold down the CTRL key and click any selected track’s Mute button
 To mute all tracks, hold down the CTRL key and click any non-selected track’s Mute button

.

.

Tip: You can quickly enable/disable the Mute button
on multiple tracks by simply clicking a button in one track, then dragging across
adjacent tracks without releasing the mouse button. Only buttons that match the clicked button’s state will change.

Controlling playback
Track-by-track playback

Soloing tracks
Sometimes you want to hear a single track, or a few tracks at once, without having to mute all the other tracks. You can do this by
soloing the tracks you want to hear.
As soon as any track is marked as a solo track, Cakewalk ignores all mute settings (unless a soloed track is also muted—mute takes
precedence over solo) and plays only the track or tracks that are set to solo. Any number of tracks at one time can be marked as
solo. All these tracks will play together. As soon as the solo status of the final solo track is turned off, Cakewalk once again plays
back tracks based on their mute settings.

To solo or unsolo individual tracks
 To solo or unsolo a track, click its Solo button

in the Track, Console view or Track Inspector.

 To solo or unsolo several tracks at once, select the tracks and do one of the following:
 Right-click a track strip and choose MSR > Solo on the pop-up menu.
 To solo all selected tracks of the same track type, hold down the CTRL key and click any selected track’s Solo button

Dim Solo mode
Normally when you solo a track/bus in Cakewalk, the tracks or buses which are not soloed are essentially muted. Dim Solo is a
mode in which non-soloed audio tracks/buses are still audible but at a reduced level. The default gain reduction is -6 dB, but can
also be configured for -12 dB and -18 dB.
Dim Solo is useful when you want to focus on a specific track but you still want to edit/mix the track in context with the entire mix.
This allows you to hear all tracks while the soloed track stands out from non-soloed tracks.
Note: Dim Solo mode only applies to audio tracks and buses, not MIDI tracks.

To enable/disable Dim Solo
Click the Dim Solo button

in the Control Bar’s Mix module.

Figure 106. The Mix module.

When Dim Solo is enabled, non-soloed audio tracks will play at a reduced gain rather than 0 gain (mute).
The Dim Solo enable/disable state is saved with each project.

To configure Dim Solo level
When Dim Solo mode is enabled, the amount of gain reduction applied to non-soloed tracks or buses is specified in the Preferences
dialog box.
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings.
2. Set the Dim Solo Gain setting to either -6 dB, -12 dB or -18 dB and click OK.
The Dim Solo dB setting is saved with each project.

Controlling playback
Track-by-track playback

Exclusive Solo mode
By default, Cakewalk allows you to solo multiple tracks and buses simultaneously. With Exclusive Solo mode, you can only solo one
track and one bus at a time.
When you solo a track or bus in Exclusive Solo mode, all other soloed tracks or buses are automatically unsoloed. This allows you to
quickly listen to individual tracks and buses in isolation without having to manually unsolo other tracks or buses.

To enable/disable Exclusive Solo mode
Click the Exclusive Solo button

in the Control Bar’s Mix module.

Figure 107. The Mix module.

Note: When you enable Exclusive Solo mode, currently soloed tracks and buses are not affected until the next time you solo
a track or bus.
There are several situations where soloing one track actually solos more than one track, even when Exclusive solo mode is enabled:

 If you solo a track folder, all tracks within the folder are soloed.
 If you solo a track that is assigned to a soft synth, all other tracks that are assigned to the same soft synth are also soloed.
 If you solo a track or bus that belongs to a Quick Group, all other tracks or buses are also soloed.
See:
“Soloing tracks” on page 299
“Dim Solo mode” on page 300
“Solo Override” on page 301

Solo Override
When you enable Solo Override on a track or bus, that track/bus will never be muted as a result of soloing any other track/bus.
This is a very useful feature when you want to always hear a particular track regardless of which other tracks are soloed. For
example, you may want to always hear the vocal track while you solo other instrument tracks. This can be accomplished easily by
using Exclusive Solo mode (see “Exclusive Solo mode” on page 301) and enabling Solo Override on the vocal track.

To enable/disable Solo Override
 Hold down the SHIFT key and click a track’s or bus’ Solo button

.

The Solo button is displayed as
to indicate that Solo Override is enabled. Solo Override prevents the track or bus from
being muted when other tracks or buses are soloed.
Note: Mute always takes precedence over Solo. A track or bus can still be muted even if Solo Override is enabled.

Inverting the phase of a track
A waveform’s exact opposite is called an inversion. It is a shift of 180 degrees. A waveform and its inversion cancel each other out
completely, so it is usually not desirable to have two track recordings of the same source if one is phase inverted. It can lead to
reduced volume, lowered or distorted response in certain frequencies, or even silence in the case of two tracks which are exactly
identical (i.e. cloned tracks).
Occasionally, for example when recording a source using two microphones, one of the microphones may be recording an inversion
of the other, the resulting tracks may, to some degree, be cancelling each other out. Cakewalk allows you to invert the phase of a
track to match another.

To invert the phase of a track
1. Open the Track view, Track Inspector or Console view.
2. In the track you want to invert the phase, click the Phase inversion button

.

Changing tracks’ mono/stereo status
Cakewalk has a Mono/Stereo button
in each track module in the Track view, Track Inspector and Console view. The buttons in
the track modules force each track to play in either stereo or mono, but preserve the tracks’ pan positions in the stereo mix. The
Mono/Stereo button
in each track forces the track’s audio signal to enter any patched plug-ins as either mono or stereo, whether
or not the tracks are mono or stereo. This allows you to use either mono effects on a stereo track or stereo effects on a mono track.

To use a track’s Stereo/Mono button
Note: You may lose important stereo data by using mono effects with stereo tracks because your stereo tracks are summed to
mono in order to pass through the effect. If you never want your stereo data to be summed to mono, select stereo.
1. Open the Track view, Track Inspector or Console view.
2. In the track you want to force to either mono or stereo for processing effects, click the Stereo/Mono button
position:

to the desired

 When the button is lit, the track streams in stereo.
 When the button is unlit, the track streams in mono.
Note: It is not possible to set a track’s Stereo/Mono button to Stereo if a mono plug-in is the first effect in the track’s FX Rack.

Mono audio clips may be increased by 3 dB in certain scenarios
There are some situations where the level of a mono clip will be increased by 3 dB if the track's output interleave (mono/stereo
toggle) is set to mono:

 If the track has mixed stereo and mono clips
 The track has a synth selected as its input source
 Input Echo is enabled or the track is armed for recording
In summary, whenever the track output interleave is mono and the data interleave is stereo, mono data will be increased in level by
3 dB.

Using mono VST plug-ins on stereo tracks may cause out of sync audio
When using a mono VST plug-in on a stereo track (interleave set to Stereo), the left and right channels will be out of sync. The left
channel is processed by the mono effect, and delay compensation is applied, while the right channel is not processed and does not
have delay compensation applied. The signal will look something like this:

 Left channel: Wet signal (delayed)
 Right channel: Dry signal (no delay)

302

Controlling playback
Track-by-track playback

A mono VST plug-in will work correctly if Enable Mono Processing is checked in the VST Plug-in Properties dialog box and the
track interleave is set to mono.
Note: Enable Mono Processing is enabled by default in Cakewalk. If you are playing back a legacy project in Cakewalk and
notice the project does not sound the same, try to disable Enable Mono Processing for any mono plug-ins used in the project.

See:
“Changing track settings” on page 303

Changing track settings
Each track in a project contains MIDI or audio information and has a variety of settings (also called parameters) that determine how
the track sounds. By changing these parameters, you can change the sound of your project. For audio tracks, you control
parameters such as volume, stereo panning, and the output device that is used to produce the sound. For MIDI tracks, you control
many additional parameters, including the type of instrument sound that is used to play the notes stored in the track. Both kinds of
tracks contain an Automation Read button
and recording, respectively.

and an Automation Write button

, which enable or disable automation playback

Note 1: You can control all sliders and knobs in the Console and Track views by clicking a control, then hover over it with the
mouse and manipulate the mouse wheel. If you move the mouse cursor away from the slider or knob while using the mouse
wheel, you will lose control of the slider or knob you are adjusting.

Note 2: You can show and hide controls in track and bus strips in the Track view, and even create presets for your favorite
control layouts. For details, see “Configuring Track view controls” on page 488 for more information.

Audio track parameters
The following figures show the various parameters in audio track strips. The figures are of an audio track that is located in the Track
view, however most of these parameters can also be adjusted in the Console view and Track Inspector. Some parameters are only
available in the Console view or Track Inspector.

Here is a summary table of the different audio track parameters and how they are used.
Parameter

What it means

Number

A sequential track number used for reference.

Name

A name that you assign the track for easy reference. Note that if you do not assign a name to a track,
the default name is the track number. This track number will change if you change the order of your
tracks.

Mute

When enabled, mutes the track.

Solo

When enabled, solos the track.

Arm

When enabled, arms the track for audio recording.

Input Echo

Turns input monitoring on or off.

Archive

The track is not played, and you must stop playback to re-enable it. Archived tracks do not tax your
CPU during playback so they can be used to store alternate takes.

Automation Read and Write buttons

Enable/disable automation playback and recording, respectively.

Peak value

Displays the Peak value, which is the amplitude of the latest audio peak in the track.

Expand/collapse Take Lanes

Hides or shows Take lanes.

Expand/collapse Automation Lanes

Parameter

What it means

Pan

The stereo distribution of the output, ranging from 100% left (hard left) to 100% right (hard right); a
value of “C” indicates sound that is centered left-to-right. On stereo tracks, pan acts as balance.

Gain

Gain is a pre-fader control which allows the fine tuning of a single track’s volume.
For example, let’s say you have four tracks, three tracks have their volume fader set to 0 dB while the
fourth track’s fader is set to +10 dB. You want to group the faders and do a slow fade out, but the
slightly higher level of the fourth track causes its volume to be higher in relation to the other tracks
towards the end of the fade out. To balance the fader levels, reduce the fader level for the fourth track
to 0 dB and raise the Volume Trim value for that track to +10 dB. The resulting volume levels for the
project are the same, but now you can group the faders and perform a fade out with no track standing
out disproportionately at the end of the fade out.

Input

The input source for the track, used in recording.

Output

The output bus through which the track is played.

Send Enable

Activates a send module, which sends a copy of the track signal to a bus.

Send Level (Track Inspector and Console
view only)

Controls volume of audio data sent by this send module.

Send Pan

Adjusts the send pan setting.

Send Pre/Post switch

Pre (pre-fader) means that the Send signal goes to the bus prior to the track’s volume fader; post
means the Send signal goes to the bus after the volume fader.

Send destination

Displays name of bus that the Send is sending data to.

Mono/Stereo

A switch that determines whether a track’s signal enters an effect or chain of effects as mono or stereo,
regardless of the nature of the track.

Phase In/Out

A switch that inverts the phase of the track.

FX Rack

The insert location for a track’s plug-ins or soft synths.

Meters

The recording and playback levels are displayed in the Playback and Record meters.

WAI display

Shows a color-coded bar if the track is being controlled by a control surface.

Track color

Opens the Track Color palette, where you can specify a custom color for each track.

Setting up output devices
The output setting for a track determines which piece of hardware or software synthesizer will be used to produce the sound stored
in your project. In a very simple equipment setup, you might have only a computer equipped with a basic sound card. In this case,
you want to play all MIDI and audio output through the sound card on your computer.
If your equipment setup also includes a MIDI keyboard attached to the MIDI port on your sound card, you can choose to route MIDI
data directly to the sound card or through the sound card MIDI port to the keyboard. If you choose the former, the music will play
from your computer speakers. If you choose the latter, the sound will play from the speaker attached to your keyboard. You can even
choose to send some MIDI information to each of these devices so that they both play at once.
You can purchase MIDI interfaces that plug into your parallel, serial, or USB port to add MIDI ports to your computer. For more
information about complex system configurations, see the online Help topic “Hardware setup” on page 1449.
If your computer has several MIDI outs, select Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices and put them in the desired order. The order in
which your MIDI devices appear in the Output menus in the Track and Console views is based solely on the order in which the
selected outs appear in Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices. As a result, the order in which your devices appear in a track’s output
control may not match the port numbers that appear on your external multiport MIDI device.
Figure 116. The MIDI - Devices section.

A

A

A. These devices are not selected

When you first run Cakewalk it asks you to select MIDI devices. You may want to change these selections in the future. You can do
so by selecting different devices in Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices.
Your computer is usually equipped with at least one audio device—your computer sound card. Your setup may have several different
audio output devices, or you may have a multichannel sound card that presents itself to your computer as though it were several
different devices, one for each stereo pair. In Cakewalk, audio tracks are assigned to main outs or buses. Each main out represents
a hardware device. You use the Output control to assign a track in a project to the main or bus you want to use. While you need to
choose the MIDI output devices you want to use before you assign them to tracks, all of your audio devices can be assigned to
tracks freely. You do not need to configure them the way you do MIDI devices. If you have a voice modem or speaker-phone in your
computer, however, you might want to set up Cakewalk so that it won’t use those devices. Also, note that some dedicated audio
equipment has specific setup requirements. For more information, see “Improving audio performance” on page 1355.

To choose MIDI devices
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices.
2. Click on any MIDI device in the Outputs list.
3. To move any device to the top of the list, deselect all other devices and click Move to Top to move the selected device to the top
of the list.
4. When all devices are selected in the order you want, click OK.
See:
“MIDI - Devices” on page 1674

Creating friendly names for MIDI output and input devices
You may find that a name you make up yourself for a MIDI device is easier to remember or more descriptive than a device’s original
name. The friendly name for a MIDI device is the name you will see places such as MIDI track Input and Output menus, and the
Controllers/Surfaces dialog box, if you enable the Use Friendly Names To Represent MIDI Devices check box at the bottom of
the MIDI Devices dialog box.
To make up a friendly name:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices.
2. Double-click the name of a device in the Friendly Name column, type a new name, and press ENTER.
3. Select the Use Friendly Names To Represent MIDI Devices check box.
4. Click OK.

Assigning Inputs & Outputs
You assign each track to a MIDI or an audio output using the Output drop-down in the Track view. From then on, material on that
track will be sent to the appropriate output device.
Note: If you rearrange your MIDI output devices after making output assignments, you may find MIDI information being sent to
different instruments than you expect. Also, Cakewalk allows you to define instruments that are associated with certain outputs
and channels. If you use this feature, the name of the output will change to reflect the instrument you have chosen.

To assign a track to an output
1. Click the Output drop-down of the track you want to assign.
2. Select the output you want to use.
To assign a group of tracks to the same output, select the tracks you want to assign, then hold down the CTRL key and assign the
Output control in any selected track. All selected tracks will be assigned to the same output.
Note: Outputs that are used by the External Insert plug-in (see “External Insert plug-in” on page 1022) cannot be assigned to
track and bus outputs. The only exceptions are master buses that have other instances of the External Insert plug-in routed to
them.

Notification when track/bus outputs are assigned to silent output
When you load a project, Cakewalk checks to see if the exact same output ports are assigned as when the project was saved.
Cakewalk’s port assignments can change if you load the project on a different hardware configuration or change driver models. If
there is any discrepancy between the port assignments that were saved and the ports that are used in the current configuration, the
ports are set to “None” and the Silent Buses Detected dialog box displays all track and bus outputs from the current project that
have been assigned to a silent output.
The Silent Buses Detected dialog box also appears if any track or bus output is assigned to None as a result of changing the audio
configuration. For more information, see “Silent Buses Detected dialog” on page 1766.

To assign the same audio input port to multiple tracks

Assigning tracks to mono hardware outputs
Cakewalk lets you assign audio track and bus outputs to individual (mono) hardware outputs in addition to stereo pairs.
This is very useful, for example, if you record in Cakewalk but want to use an external mixing console to mix.

To show mono hardware outputs
Cakewalk does not show mono hardware outputs by default. To show mono outputs, do the following:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Devices.
2. Select the Show Mono Outputs check box and click OK.
Mono hardware outputs are now available in all locations that display audio output ports, with the exception of the Media Browser
view, Loop Construction view and Import Audio dialog box. Each available audio port exposes Left, Right and Stereo channels.
Note: The Show Mono Outputs option only affects the display of mono hardware outputs in Cakewalk; it does not affect current
output port assignments on tracks and buses. Existing mono output assignments are retained even if you disable the Show
Mono Outputs option.

Assigning stereo tracks to mono outputs
When a stereo track is assigned to a mono hardware output, the left and right channels are downmixed to mono. All track/bus gain
and pan settings are applied prior to mono conversion.

Backward compatibility
Loading a Cakewalk project with mono output assignments in an earlier version SONAR will cause the mono assignments to be lost.

Choosing the instrument sound (bank and patch)
Electronic keyboards and synthesizers often contain hundreds or thousands of different sounds. Each sound is known as a patch.
The name comes from the early days of synthesizers, for which you physically rewired (using patch cords) the oscillators and
modulators to produce different sounds. Patches are normally organized into groups of 128, called banks. Most instruments have
between 1 and 8 banks, but MIDI supports up to 16,384 banks of 128 patches each (that’s over 2 million patches).The Bank and
Patch controls in the Console view and Track Inspector control the initial bank and patch of a track during playback. Every time
Cakewalk starts playback at the beginning of a project, the bank and patch settings for the track are set to these initial values. Many
instruments have descriptive names for their banks and patches. Cakewalk stores these names in an instrument definition. If you are
using an instrument that supports General MIDI, your patch list will contain the 128 sounds that are defined by the General MIDI
specification.
Note: Different MIDI instruments use different types of commands to change banks. Cakewalk supports four common methods
for changing banks. For information about the bank selection method you should use with your MIDI gear, see your MIDI
equipment’s documentation.

Tip: If your bank name is too long to fit in the Bank field, hold your cursor over the bank name. A tooltip appears with the complete
bank name.
Note that a single MIDI channel can only play one patch at a time on each instrument assigned to that channel. Therefore, if two or
more MIDI tracks are set to the same output and channel but have different bank and patch settings, the patch of the highestnumbered track will be used for all the tracks. In some projects you want the sound played by a track to change while playback is in
progress. You can accomplish this using the Insert > Bank/Patch Change command. When you start playback in the middle of a
project, Cakewalk searches back through the track to find the correct patch to use—either the initial bank and patch or the most
recent bank/patch change. Note that the Console view and Track Inspector only show the initial bank and patch, even while a
different bank and patch are being played back. The only way to see and edit a bank/patch change is in the Event List view. For
more information, see “The Event List view” on page 887.

Solo/Record buttons. The controls are labeled “C,” “B” and “P”, respectively. Click the Channel control (“C”) and select the
desired MIDI channel. This will set all MIDI data on this track to output on the selected channel.
4. Click the Bank control (“B”) and select the desired bank.
Cakewalk can display a hardware synth's banks and patches by name if you have assigned the corresponding instrument
definition for your hardware synth. For details, see ““To assign instrument definitions to MIDI outputs and channels” on page
1310”. Note that VST soft synths often do not expose this information to Cakewalk.
5. Click the Patch control (“P”) and select the desired patch (instrument).
To search for a patch containing specific text, click the Patch Browser button in the Track Inspector. You can also open the
Patch Browser by right-clicking a Bank or Patch control in the Track Inspector or Console view. For details, see “To choose

Adjusting volume and pan
The Volume and Pan settings control the initial volume and pan of a track during playback. Every time Cakewalk starts playback, the
Volume and Pan settings for the track are set to these initial levels. Cakewalk allows you to choose different panning laws if you want
(see “Configuring panning laws” on page 319).
In some projects you want the volume or panning of a track to change while playback is in progress. You can accomplish this by
drawing a volume or pan envelope in the Track view, or by recording automation. For more information, see “Automation” on page
1207.
Note: For MIDI tracks, Cakewalk processes the volume and pan settings by transmitting MIDI volume and pan events
(controllers 7 and 10, respectively) when playback starts. If two or more MIDI tracks are set to the same output and channel but
have different volume or pan settings, the settings for the highest-numbered track will prevail.
Note also that not all keyboards and synthesizers respond to these events. Check your instrument’s manual for more information.

To set the initial volume setting
1. Move your cursor to the Volume control of the track you want to change.
2. Click and drag to the left to lower the volume or the right to raise the volume.
You can also change the volume settings in a variety of other ways, as described under “Changing track settings in the Track pane”
on page 309.

To set the initial Pan setting
1. Move your cursor to the Pan control of the track you want to change.
2. Click and drag to the left to adjust the pan to the left or to the right to adjust the pan to the right. Hard left is 100% left. Hard right
is 100% right. Pan is centered at C.
You can also change the pan and volume settings in a variety of other ways, as described under “Changing track settings in the
Track pane” on page 309.

Configuring panning laws
You can choose from six different panning laws. A panning law is the mathematical formula that a sequencer or mixer uses to control
panning.

To change panning laws
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings.
2. In the Stereo Panning Law field, choose one of these options:

 (Default) 0dB center, sin/cos taper, constant power. This choice causes a 3 dB boost in a signal that’s panned hard left or
right, and no dip in output level in either channel when the signal is center panned.

 -3dB center, sin/cos taper, constant power. This choice causes no boost in a signal that’s panned hard left or right, and 3
dB dip in output level in either channel when the signal is center panned.

 0dB center, square-root taper, constant power. This choice causes a 3 dB boost in a signal that’s panned hard left or
right, and no dip in output level in either channel when the signal is center panned.

 -3dB center, square root taper, constant power. This choice causes no boost in a signal that’s panned hard left or right,
and 3 dB dip in output level in either channel when the signal is center panned.

 -6dB center, linear taper. This choice causes no boost in a signal that’s panned hard left or right, and 6 dB dip in output
level in either channel when the signal is center panned.

 0 dB center, balance control. This choice causes no boost in a signal that’s panned hard left or right, and no dip in output
level in either channel when the signal is center panned.
3. Click OK.

Pan Law compatibility mode
When using a non-default pan law with floating point or 24-bit audio, Cakewalk would previously apply the pan law twice; once at the
clip level and once more at the track level.
In SONAR 8.5.2 and later, pan laws are only applied once at the track level and only for mono tracks. Any clip pan envelopes will
continue to work, but behave strictly as a balance control.
If you have existing projects that use a non-default pan law (i.e. other than 0dB center sin/cos taper), the mix might sound louder in
Cakewalk. To address backwards compatibility with projects that were mixed in previous versions of SONAR, the following Aud.ini
variable is available to set the pan law compatibility mode:
PanLawCompatMode=<0 or 1> (default=0)
This variable should be set in the [Wave] section. For example:
[Wave]
PanLawCompatMode=1
When the value is 0 (default), non-default pan laws are not applied at the clip level. Clip pan envelopes always use the 0dB center
sin/cos taper law.
When the value is 1, pan laws are applied at the clip level. It is not recommended that you use this value unless you need to retain
backwards compatibility with pre-SONAR projects that use a non-default pan law.

Adjusting volume trim
Volume Trim acts like the trim control on a mixer, raising or lower the level prior to the volume fader. Volume trim is useful for
calibrating your faders to match a dB reference level or for aligning your faders for grouping. The Volume Trim control has a range
of -18 dB to +18 dB. Raising or lowering the Volume Trim raises or lowers the apparent volume of the track by that amount without
affecting the actual fader level.

To set the volume trim level
In the Track Inspector or Console view, adjust the Gain control at the top of the channel strip.

Controlling playback

Assigning a MIDI channel (Chn)
MIDI transmits information on 16 channels, numbered 1 through 16. Every MIDI event is assigned to a particular channel. Some
MIDI equipment can accept MIDI information on only a single channel. This channel may be preassigned, or you may be able to
change it. Other MIDI equipment, including many electronic keyboards and synthesizers, can accept information on several different
MIDI channels at once. Usually, these devices use a different instrument sound for each channel.
On playback, the channel number is used to direct the MIDI information to a particular piece of equipment.
The Chn control in the Track Inspector and Console view redirects all events in the track to the specified channel, ignoring the
channel number stored with each event. If this parameter is left blank, all events in the track are sent to their original channels. This
parameter does not affect the channel information that is stored with each MIDI event. When the track is displayed in other views,
like the Piano Roll or Event List view, you will see the original channel that is stored in the file. You can edit the channel values in
those views or use the Process > Find/Change command.

To set the channel for a track
In the Track Inspector or Console view, click the Chn control and select a MIDI channel.

Adjusting the Key/transposing a track (Key+)
Each MIDI note event has a key number, or pitch. On playback, the key offset (Key+) parameter transposes all notes in the track by
the designated number of half-steps. The value can range from -127 to +127. A value of 12 indicates that notes will be played back
one octave higher than they are written. This parameter does not affect the note number that is stored for each note event. When the
clip is displayed in other views, like the Piano Roll, Staff, or Event List view, you will see the original notes as they are stored in the
file. To permanently change the pitches, you can edit them individually or use the Process > Transpose command.
If the key offset value transposes the key number (MIDI note) outside the allowable MIDI range (0–127), the key number will be
transposed to the lowest or highest octave within that range.
You can use the Key+ parameter to assist in preparing scores for instruments whose music is written in something other than
“concert” key (such as Bb trumpet). For more information, see “Music notation for non-concert-key instruments” on page 1305.
When you edit the Key+ parameter, pressing [ or ] changes the value by 12 instead of by 10. This makes it easy to transpose by
octaves.

To set the key offset for a track
1. Select the track and open the Track Inspector.
2. In the Track Inspector, click the Key+ control.
3. Enter a value (1 = a semitone), or press the + or – key to change the key by a single semitone. Use the [ or ] key to change the
key by 12 semitones (one octave).

Controlling playback
Changing track settings

Adjusting the note velocity (Vel+)
Each MIDI note event has a velocity, which represents how fast the key was struck when the track was recorded. On playback, the
velocity offset parameter adjusts the velocity data for all notes in the track by the designated amount. The value can range from -127
to +127. The effect of changing velocities depends on the synthesizer. Some synthesizers do not respond to velocity information. For
others, the effect varies depending on the sound or patch you have chosen. Normally, higher velocities result in louder and/or
brighter-sounding notes. This parameter does not affect the velocity that is stored for each note event. When the clip is displayed in
other views, like the Piano Roll view, Staff view, or Event List view, you will see the original velocities as they are stored in the file.
You can edit the velocity values in those views, or use the Process > Scale Velocity or Process > Find/Change command.
Velocity is different from volume in that it is an attribute of each event, rather than a controller that affects an entire MIDI channel.
Here’s an example of where this distinction might be important. Suppose you have several tracks containing different drum parts. All
of these parts would probably be assigned to MIDI channel 10 (that’s the default channel for percussion in General MIDI). If you
change the volume setting for any track that uses channel 10, all the different drum parts—regardless of what track they’re in—
would be affected. If you change the note velocity for one drum track, it will be the only one whose volume is affected.

To set the velocity offset for a track
1. Open the Track Inspector or Console view.
2. Select the track you want to edit.
3. Adjust the Vel+ knob at the top of the channel strip.

Adjusting the time alignment of a MIDI track (Time+)
Each event takes place at a known point in the project. On playback, the time offset (Time+) parameter adjusts the times for MIDI
events in the track by the designated amount. The value can be as small as a single clock tick or as large as you want. This
parameter can be used to make a part play behind the beat or in front of it or to compensate for tracks that sound rushed or late. The
time shift can be used to create a chorus or slap-back echo effect by making a copy of a track and then applying a small offset to the
copy. You can use larger time offsets to shift a track earlier or later by several beats or measures. Note that you cannot shift any
event earlier than 1:01:000. For example, if the first event in the track starts at 2:01:000, you cannot shift its start time earlier by more
than one measure.
This parameter does not affect the time that is stored for each note event. When the clip is displayed in other views, like the Piano
Roll, Staff, or Event List view, you will see the original times as they are stored in the file.

To set the time offset for a track
1. Select the track and open the Track Inspector.
2. In the Track Inspector, click the Time+ control.
3. Enter a value, or press the + or – key until you reach the value you want.

Other MIDI playback settings
Three other MIDI settings can affect what happens when you play back your project, as described in the following table.
Option

How it works

Zero Controllers When Play Stops

If this option is enabled, Cakewalk zeros (resets) the pitch wheel, the pedal Controller, and the
modulation wheel Controller on all 16 MIDI channels whenever playback is stopped. It also sends a
“Zero All Continuous Controllers” MIDI message, which turns off other continuous Controllers on newer
synthesizers. If you experience frequent stuck notes when playback stops, try checking this option.

MIDI Event Chase on Play

If this option is enabled, Cakewalk searches for and sends the most recent patch change, wheel, and
pedal events on each output and MIDI channel before starting playback. This ensures that all these
settings are correct, even if you start playback at an arbitrary point in your project.

Include Note Events.

When MIDI Event Chase on Play is enabled, the Include Note Events option allows MIDI Note events
to play even if they start earlier than the initial playback location.

To set these options, go to Edit > Preferences > Project - MIDI. If you have set up a playback loop, enabling either of these options
can cause an audible delay when the loop is restarted.
See:
“Controlling live MIDI playback - MIDI echo” on page 327

Customizing track/bus colors
Each channel strip in the Track view, Console view and Inspector can have a custom color tint, which allows you to color-code your
tracks and clips for better project organization.
When you change the track color, it affects the track strip in the Track view, Console view, Inspector, and clip foreground color
(waveform or MIDI data).

select Default on the pop-up menu.

Tip: You can use a Quick Group to change the color of multiple tracks simultaneously. To do so, select the tracks you want to change,
then hold down the CTRL key while you change any selected track’s color. All selected tracks will be set to the same color settings.

Bus strip colors
If you assign a color to a bus strip, all non-colored tracks that are routed to that bus automatically inherit the same color by default.
For example, in the following figure, all tracks are routed to the Master bus. Tracks 1 and 2 have custom track colors, while tracks 38 use default track colors. If you assign a custom color to the Master bus, tracks 1 and 2 remain unchanged, while tracks 3-8 inherit
the same color as the Master bus.
Figure 124. The bus color also affects all non-colored tracks that are routed to that bus.

If you do not want tracks to inherit bus colors, go to Edit > Preferences > Customization - Colors and click the Track Defaults
button, then click and hold down the Follow Bus button and select Default on the pop-up menu. You can also configure individual
tracks to ignore bus colors (see “To select a track color” on page 323).

Tip: If you want to visually verify which tracks are routed to a particular bus, temporarily assign a custom color to a bus. All non-colored
tracks that are routed to that bus automatically inherit the same color.

To remove a track color
Click the track’s Track Color bar to open the color palette, then assign Color to Default.

To use a custom color
Click the track’s Track Color bar to open the color palette, then click Other and specify the desired color.

Controlling live MIDI playback - MIDI echo
When you play your MIDI keyboard or controller, the sound that Cakewalk produces is determined by what hardware or software
synth Cakewalk sends the incoming MIDI data to after Cakewalk receives the data. This is called MIDI echo. By default, Cakewalk
sends the data to the MIDI output or software synth listed in the Output field of the current track. The current track is the one whose
track name background has the lighter color—press the up and down arrows on your computer keyboard and watch each track turn
lighter in succession as you change different tracks into the current track (you can also click any of a track’s controls to make it
current).
However, you can echo MIDI data to much more than just the current track, or turn echoing off on the current track if you want. With
a single keyboard or controller, you can echo MIDI data to as many MIDI tracks as you want, meaning that you can simultaneously
play as many hardware and software synths as you can hook up to your MIDI interface or run on your computer. You can also have
multiple performers on different controllers sending MIDI data to either the same synth or multiple synths. Each Cakewalk track
allows you to select what MIDI input ports and channels the track will respond to. The Output field of the track determines what
instrument will sound when the track receives the data. Each track’s Input Echo button determines whether the track echoes MIDI
data.

The Input Echo button
Each MIDI track has an Input Echo button, which controls whether the track will echo MIDI data or not. The button has three states:
On
, Auto
, and Off
. When the button is on, the track echoes MIDI data. In Auto mode, the track echoes MIDI data because
the track is the current track. When the button is off, the track does not echo any data, even if it is the current track. The Off position
on a current MIDI track is only available if you disable the Always Echo Current MIDI Track option in Edit > Preferences > MIDI Playback and Recording. The Auto position becomes unavailable with this setting.
There are several ways to turn Input Echoing on:

 Click a track’s Input Echo button so that it is on.
 Click a track to make the track the current track (if the Always Echo Current MIDI Track option in Edit > Preferences > MIDI Playback and Recording is enabled). In this situation (which is the default), if the track’s Input Echo button is not on, the button
appears as

to indicate that this track echoes data because it is the current track.

 If the Always Echo Current MIDI Track option in Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Playback and Recording is disabled, make a
track the current track, and click the track’s Input Echo button

.

Storing favorite configurations
If you want a track to respond to more than one port or channel, you must create a preset input configuration. If you create some
favorite configurations of MIDI input options, not only will they be stored with the project you created them in, but you can save each
one as a preset to load in any MIDI track in any project you want. Clicking the drop-down arrow in a track’s Input field displays the
Inputs drop-down menu, which has the Manage Presets choice that allows you to create and store your favorite combinations of
MIDI input choices.

To play one synth at a time from one or more MIDI keyboards
 Since this is Cakewalk’s default behavior, simply use the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW keys on your computer keyboard to
choose the current track (the current track has a lighter track name background color), and use the Track Inspector or Console
view to choose the synth you want to play by using the track’s Output, Bank, Patch, and Channel fields. With the default
behavior, all MIDI input from all ports and channels is merged and sent through the current track. Notice that the track’s Input field
says Omni.

 If you’ve disabled the default behavior (see next procedure), you must make sure that the current track’s Input Echo button is lit
up (on) before you can play the synth that the track is patched to.

To disable the default MIDI echo setting
 If you want to turn off the automatic MIDI echoing of the current track, disable the Always Echo Current MIDI Track in Edit >
Preferences > MIDI - Playback and Recording. If you then turn off the current track’s Input Echo button
keyboard, Cakewalk will not produce sound.

Inspector or Console view.
2. In the Input field of each track that you want to play, click the drop-down arrow and choose the MIDI input port and channel that
you want the track to respond to from the following options:

 None. This option actually sets the Input field to Omni. With this setting the track will respond to any MIDI input coming in
on any port (MIDI interface input driver) on any channel.

 (name of MIDI input driver) > MIDI Omni. Choosing this option causes the track to respond to any MIDI channel coming
from the named MIDI interface input driver.

 (name of MIDI input driver) > MIDI ch 1-16. Choosing this option causes the track to respond ONLY to whatever MIDI
channel you choose coming from the named MIDI interface input driver.

 Preset. If you’ve created any preset collections of input ports and channels, you can select one here.
 Manage Presets. If you want to create or edit any preset collections of input ports and channels, you can select this option
(see following procedure).
3. Make sure that the Input Echo button

on each track that you want to play is turned on.

To create or edit a preset input configuration
1. In the Input field of a track that you want to select inputs for, click the drop-down arrow and choose Manage Presets from the
drop-down menu.
The MIDI Input Presets dialog box appears.
2. In the Input Port column, find the input port that you want to use for this track (if you only use a single-port MIDI interface, you’ll
only see one choice).
3. To the right of the input port, select the MIDI channels that you want this track to respond to on this MIDI port.
4. Select channels for any other MIDI port that’s listed, if you want to use channels on that port also.
5. If you want to save this configuration, type a name for it in the window at the top of the dialog box, and click the Disk icon to save
it.
Now, when you choose inputs for other tracks, you can choose the preset you saved by clicking the Presets option in the track’s
Input drop-down menu. If you want to edit a preset, select it in the top window of the MIDI Input Presets dialog box, edit it, and click
the Disk icon. If you want to delete a preset, select it in the same dialog box and click the X button to delete it.

To use multiple performers on multiple tracks
1. For performer number 1, click the Input drop-down menu(s) of the track(s) you want that performer to play, and choose the port
and MIDI channel that performer 1’s keyboard is sending data to Cakewalk on.
2. Repeat step 1 for all other performers.
3. If there is any track that you want more than one performer to play, create a preset of the input ports and channels that you want
that track to respond to (see previous procedure).
4. Make sure the Input Echo button

is on for each track you want to play.

To turn MIDI echo (and input monitoring) on or off for all tracks

Controlling live MIDI playback - MIDI echo

Local control
You should normally disable the Local Control setting on your master keyboard to prevent notes from being doubled when you play
your keyboard. If you disable Local Control, your keyboard sends notes that you play to Cakewalk, which echoes them to the
synthesizer, which plays them only once.
When Cakewalk starts, you can have it send a special MIDI message that attempts to disable Local Control automatically. Most
modern synthesizers respond to this message. If yours does not, you will need to disable Local Control every time you turn it on for
use with Cakewalk.

To automatically disable all local control whenever you launch Cakewalk
1. Navigate to the Cakewalk app data directory (%appdata%\Cakewalk\Cakewalk Core) and double-click on the TTSseq.ini
file to open it.
2. In the [Options] section, add the line:
SendLocalOff=1
3. Save the file and close it.
4. When you launch Cakewalk, it automatically sends a Local Off message to your keyboard.
Note: Not all keyboards respond to Local Off messages.

“Playing files in sequence with the Play List” on page 329

Playing files in sequence with the Play List
The Play List view allows you to automatically play multiple files in sequence. A Play List is a list of projects arranged in the desired
playback order, from top to bottom. You can use this feature in live performance applications or just for fun.
Figure 127. The Play List.

The Play List view lets you create and work with a series of project, MIDI, and bundle files. You can create, edit, and save a Play List
(or set) of up to 999 Cakewalk projects. As each file plays, Cakewalk loads it and displays it in the Track view and other views like
any other project file.
You can program the list to pause between songs for a fixed amount of time, or to wait for a keystroke before proceeding. You can
start playback from any project in the Play List by simply double-clicking the desired project.
To create a new Play List, go to File > New, choose Play List Set from the list, and click OK.

Video playback, import, and export
Video files play in the Video view in real time as your project plays. You can also view your video on an external DV device
connected to an IEEE 1394 port (“FireWire”).
The File > Import > Video command lets you include the following video file types in your project:

 AVI (also called Video for Windows).
 MPEG-2
 MPEG-4/H.264
 Windows Media Video.
 QuickTime (encoded as H.264/ .m4v or MPEG-4 only). Cakewalk supports QuickTime 7, including H.264 support and the ability to
import AAC audio files.
The File > Export > Video command lets you export your audio tracks and your imported video as the following file types:
Note: Some .mov and .avi files contain no video. You can’t import these files with the File > Import > Video command. You
must use the File > Import > Audio command instead, and set the Files of type field to All Files.

 AVI (also called Video for Windows)
 Windows Media Video
 QuickTime
Cakewalk also has a Video Thumbnails pane at the top of the Track view, which shows individual frames of your video at different
places in your project (See “Using the Video Thumbnails pane” on page 339 for more information).
You open the Video view by using the Views > Video command. The Video view displays the Now time (as in the Big Time view) and
the video itself. The display in the Video view is synchronized with the Now time, giving you convenient random access to the video
stream. This makes it easy to align music and digitized sound to the video.
Commands in the Video view’s right-click pop-up menu let you set the time display format, the size and stretch options for the video
display, the video start and trim times, and other options.

QuickTime issues
In order to import/export QuickTime files in Cakewalk, you must install both the filters AND QuickTime. The following are some other
known QuickTime issues:

 It is presently only possible to export QuickTime videos on a 32-bit system. This is a limitation of QuickTime, not Cakewalk.
 QuickTime Import/Export requires version 6.5.1 or higher of the QuickTime Player to be installed. The QuickTime Player is not
included with Cakewalk, but can be downloaded separately from Apple's website (www.apple.com/quicktime/download/win.html).

 Audio mixdown to QuickTime must be set to 16 bits stereo or mono, or the resulting export will create a unusable file or abort with
an error.

 Audio mixdown to QuickTime must be set to 48 KHz or less or the resulting export will create a file that plays back incorrectly.
 When exporting to QuickTime, the frame rate of the QuickTime video compressor will default to “best possible”. Since not all
movies in a Cakewalk video project correctly report their frame rate, the best practice is manually enter the desired frame rate.
This is done in the video settings of the QuickTime video compressor.

 Exports to QuickTime from a Cakewalk video project created from an AVI using the Indeo video compressor will create a movie
with white frames.

 Exports to QuickTime may have an extra white frame on the last frame of the movie. This extra frame can be removed with the
QuickTime Pro Player or another QuickTime editing application.

Importing and playing back videos
Here are step-by-step procedures for inserting and playing back videos:

To load a video file into a project
1. Choose File > Import > Video, or choose Insert from the Video view’s pop-up menu.
The Import Video dialog box appears. In the Files of type field, select the kind of video file you’re looking for.
Tip: You can also drag a video file from the Browser and drop it on the Video Thumbnails pane.

2. Select a file.
3. Select the Show File Info check box to display information about the file in the File Info section of the dialog box.
4. Select the Import Audio Stream check box if you want to load the file’s audio data.
5. Select the Import As Mono Tracks check box if you want to import the file’s audio data as one or more mono tracks.
6. Click Open.
Cakewalk loads the video file and displays it in the Video view. If you choose to import audio data, Cakewalk inserts a new track
above the currently selected track, and puts the audio data in a clip or clips on the new track.
Note 1: When you save a project that contains video, Cakewalk saves the project’s video file by reference only; the actual video
data remains in the original file. Video data is not saved in bundle files, so it must be backed up on its own.

Note 2: After you load a video file into a project, you can play it back either in the Video view, or on an external DV device
through a FireWire port. See “Video playback on a FireWire DV device” on page 341 for more information.

To play a video file in the Video view
1. Open the Video view by choosing Views > Video.
2. Press the SPACEBAR to play or stop video playback.
3. To change the display size of the video, right-click in the Video view and choose Stretch Options > [desired size] from the popup menu.
Note: When you play a video file that has high temporal compression, such as movies optimized for web delivery, playback
may not be smooth unless you disable video thumbnails, (see “Using the Video Thumbnails pane” on page 339 for more
information).

To delete the video from the project
1. Open the Video view by choosing Views > Video.
2. Right-click in the Video view and choose Delete.
Cakewalk removes the video from the project. Note that imported audio data is not deleted.

To enable or disable video playback
1. Open the Video view by choosing Views > Video.
2. Right-click in the Video view and choose Animate.
If your computer is not fast enough to play back video efficiently, you can get better performance by temporarily disabling video
animation during playback.

Exporting video
After you’ve mixed your audio tracks the way you want them, you can export the inserted video file together with your audio tracks to
create a new video file.
When you export a video, any changes you’ve made to the Start, Trim-In, or Trim-Out times determine how long your new exported
video is compared to the original video that you inserted into your Cakewalk project.
Note: If you’re exporting an AVI file, the No Compression option in the Video Codec field of the AVI Encoder Options dialog
box is a good choice. This choice does not change or compress your source video material. If you want your exported AVI file
to be compressed, the Cinepak option will create an AVI file that plays back smoothly with decent quality. The MJPEG option
will create an AVI file that does not play back as smoothly, but is a high quality format to archive a file in.

To export a video
1. Make sure your audio tracks are completely mixed, and your video Start time, Trim-In time, and Trim-Out time are set the way
you want them.
2. Use the File > Export > Video command.
The Export Video dialog box appears.
3. In the File Name field, type a name for your new video.
4. In the Files of type field, choose the kind of video file you want the exported file to be.
5. Click the Encoding Options button to open a dialog box of encoding options for the kind of file you’re creating. Some codecs do
not work: click the Help button in the dialog box for help choosing options.
Note: If you’re exporting an AVI file to either a 24-bit audio format or to a multi-channel (surround sound) format, set the Audio
Codec in the AVI Encoding Options dialog box to No Compression.
6. Click the Audio Mixdown Options button to open a dialog box of audio mixdown options. Click the Help button in the dialog box
for help choosing options.

See:
“Exporting audio” on page 1135

Optimizing video performance
Here are a few tips to optimize video performance:

 Viewing your video in on an external DV device will significantly decrease the processor load on your computer if the video stream
is a DV AVI file. See “Video playback on a FireWire DV device” on page 341 for more information.

 If you intend to do a lot of seeking around or looping and editing while a video file is loaded, make sure that your video file has
sufficient keyframes. Since each frame has to be computed from the last keyframe encountered, if you have very few keyframes
in the video, performance may be slow. To change the number of keyframes, you may recompress the file using the File >
Export > Video command and specify more frequent keyframes. Choose a suitable video compressor such as Cinepak and
change the KeyFrame Rate parameter to a number between 1-5. A value of 1 makes every frame a keyframe, and higher
numbers insert a keyframe after that many frames.

 Changing the video properties of an AVI file, such as Trim and Start time, can make realtime performance slightly slower. You can
make these changes permanent (and thereby reduce the load on your CPU) by using the File > Export > Video command, and
then re-importing the file.

 Playing videos at a resolution (video size) of 320x240 is usually a high enough resolution to monitor the video while you’re
composing a soundtrack. You can still choose to stretch the video to full screen at this resolution. You set the video size on the
Render Quality tab of the Video Properties dialog box. Using a higher resolution can bog down your computer if you’re
processing audio tracks at the same time.

Using the Video Thumbnails pane
At the top of the Track view in Cakewalk is the Video Thumbnails pane, which displays individual frames of your video at certain time
intervals of your project. The time interval between displayed frames is determined by the zoom level you choose. If you zoom in far
enough, you can view each individual frame of your video.
Note 1: If you’re playing back a highly compressed movie (not many keyframes in the file), it can take about a minute to redraw
video thumbnails when you’re playing the movie or resizing a window.

Note 2: Some Windows Media videos do not report their frame rate to Cakewalk. Cakewalk can play these files, but cannot
create thumbnails from them, so no thumbnails appear in the Thumbnail pane.

Video playback on a FireWire DV device
You can view your video projects on an external FireWire DV device.
Note 1: You can only view video projects on an external FireWire DV device when using Cakewalk’s DirectShow video engine.
The default Media Foundation engine does not support this feature.

Note 2: This feature will decrease the processor load to your computer if the video stream is a DV AVI file. If the stream is not
DV AVI, the CPU load will significantly increase, compared to playing back on-screen with Cakewalk’s Video view.

To specify the default video engine
When importing a video file, Cakewalk will first attempt to use the default Media Foundation video engine. If the video format is not
supported, Cakewalk will next attempt to use the legacy DirectShow video engine.
To specify the default video engine:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Configuration File.
2. Under Configuration Settings, click Edit Config File.
The Aud.ini file opens in the default Windows text editor.
3. In Aud.ini, create a new [Video] section and add a new entry called VideoEngine and set its value to 0. For example:
[Video]
VideoEngine=0
Valid values are as follows:

 0 = DirectShow engine.
 1 = Media Foundation engine (default).
4. Save Aud.ini and close the Windows text editor.
5. Click Reload Config Settings to reload the current audio configuration settings from Aud.ini.

Tip: To confirm which video engine is currently used, right-click the Video view or video thumbnail and select Video Properties on
the pop-up menu, then click the Info tab.

To convert a Video project to DV AVI format
1. Use the File > Export > Video command.
The Export Video dialog box appears.
2. In the File Name field, type a name for your new video.
3. In the Save as Type field, choose Video for Windows.
4. Click the Encoding Options button to open the AVI Encoder options dialog box, and choose DV Video Encoder in the Video
Codec field. Click OK.
5. Click the Audio Mixdown Options button to open a dialog box of audio mixdown options. Choose the audio options you want,
but remember that if you plan to save the project to DV tape, choose the following audio format:

 Channel Format. Choose Stereo.
 Sample Rate. Choose 48000.
 Bit Depth. Choose 16.
6. Click Save to export your video.
Once you save the video file, it can be re-inserted into a project (see “Importing and playing back videos” on page 334). If the project
will ultimately be exported to tape, that project will need to have an audio sample rate of 48 KHz playing back at 16 bits.

To play video on an external DV device
1. Connect your external FireWire device. Make sure Windows recognizes the device, and displays the device’s icon on the
Windows taskbar.
2. Launch Cakewalk and open your video project.
3. In Cakewalk’s video view (Views > Video command), right-click the Video view and choose External DV Output > <name of
external DV device> from the pop-up menu.
4. Play your Cakewalk project.
The video disappears from the Video view and appears on your external monitor or camcorder. Leave the Video view open so
that you can move the Now Time frame-by-frame with the Video view keyboard shortcuts.
If the Video view is the active window, you can use keyboard shortcuts to advance by a frame or a frame increment. The +/-, and left/
right arrow keys move forward/backwards by a single frame. If you hold down the CTRL key, then the frame increment value is used
(default = 5 frames). You can also use the [ and ] keys to seek by the frame increment.
If your video does not play back in sync with your audio, see “Synchronizing external video playback to audio” on page 343.

External DV output (IEEE 1394/FireWire)
Cakewalk relies on the Microsoft AV/C drivers to communicate with DV devices that are connected to a IEEE 1394 FireWire bus on
your computer, in order to control and preview video to digital video devices.
If another software application overwrites or disables these drivers, the Preview to FireWire and Print to Tape feature may not
function correctly. If you are going to install a software application that uses DV devices connected to the IEEE 1394 FireWire bus,
please check with the software vendor about DV device drivers it may install. Also, please check with the manufacturer of your DV
device for AV/C-compliance information. The following devices have been tested and known to work properly with Cakewalk:

 ADS Pyro A/V Link DV transcoder
 Canopus ADVC-100 DV transcoder
 Canon ZR-85 MiniDV camcorder
Note: When using DV AVI movies, the transcoding unit must be set to the same format (NTSC or PAL) as the video file, or
Preview to FireWire and Print to Tape will fail to work properly. Also, CPU consumption will be lower when the source material
is in DV format, since the format is native to the FireWire device and doesn't incur a CPU hit for transcoding video.

Exporting a project to a FireWire DV device
Once your project sounds the way you want it to, you can export the video and audio together to an external FireWire DV device.
This is called “printing to tape,” if your external device uses tape.

To export a project to an external DV device
1. Use the File > Export > Video command to open the Export Video dialog box.
2. In the Save as Type field, choose AVC Compliant Device. You might see a different name in the drop-down menu, depending
on what type of external device you are using.
3. Click the Audio Mixdown Options button to open the Audio Mixdown Options dialog box.
4. In the Audio Mixdown Options dialog box, choose the following options, and then click OK:

 Channel Format. Choose Stereo.
 Sample Rate. Choose 48000.
 Bit Depth. Choose 16.
5. In the Export Video dialog box, click the Encoding Options button to open the property page of your external device.
6. In the property page, use the transport controls to position the tape in your external device to a blank area for recording.
7. Close the property page, and click the Save button in the Export Video dialog box to start exporting. If you’re printing to a device
that uses tape, the tape stops rolling when the export process is finished.

Synchronizing external video playback to audio
Because there is more latency in FireWire video playback than in computer digital audio playback, video playback on an external
device will probably be playing back later than the audio tracks in Cakewalk.

To sync external video to audio
1. Right-click the Video view and choose Video Properties from the pop-up menu to open the Video Properties dialog box.
2. On the Render Quality tab of the dialog box, under External DV Output, enter an offset number in the Video Sync Offset field.
The number you enter here causes the Video to start playing sooner than the audio. It’s helpful if your video has some pre-roll
footage that contains a visual sync point.
Note: The offset is accurate to 3 decimal places, e.g. 1 ms (a thousandth of a second). One frame of video is approximately 33
ms long for NTSC and 40 ms for PAL; the offset will typically be less than 1 second.
3. Click OK to close the dialog box. Play your video, and readjust the Video Sync Offset number as needed.

Locating missing audio
If you try to open a project and Cakewalk is unable to locate all the audio files that the project references, the Find Missing Audio
dialog box appears. The Find Missing Audio dialog box helps you find any missing audio in your project.
See:
“The Find Missing Audio dialog” on page 343
“Restoring missing audio files” on page 344
“Managing shared and external files” on page 344

The Find Missing Audio dialog
Use the Find Missing Audio dialog box to find missing audio in your project. The following is a brief description of the options you
have in this dialog:

 Open. Click this button once you have searched for and found the missing audio file.
 Skip. Click this button to move to the next missing file. When you skip and audio file your project opens without that piece of
missing audio.

 Skip All. Click this button to skip all missing audio files. When you skip all missing audio files, you project opens without those
pieces of missing audio

 Search. Click this button to begin a search of all available hard drives for your missing audio file.

Restoring missing audio files
When you open a project file that references audio files which Cakewalk can not find, the Find Missing Audio dialog box appears.
Use the following procedure to restore the missing audio files to your project.

To restore missing audio files
1. In the Find Missing Audio dialog box, click the Search button.
The Search for Missing Audio dialog box appears and Cakewalk begins searching all available hard drives for the missing file
or files.
2. When Cakewalk is finished searching, the files that it has found appear in the dialog box.
3. Select the file or files that Cakewalk has found and click OK.
The Find Missing Audio dialog box appears.
4. Select one of the following options:

 Move file to Project Audio Folder. Use this option if you are sure that no other projects are referencing this file in its
present location.

 Copy file to Project Audio Folder. Use this option if the missing file is shared with another project and you want to keep all
of your project’s audio files together.

 Reference file from present location. Use this option if you want to leave the missing file in its current location now that
Cakewalk knows where it is.
5. Click Open.
Cakewalk moves, copies or references the missing file or files as you instructed.

Managing shared and external files
You may want to share files between projects. The files you want to share may be frequently used sound effects or drum loops.
Cakewalk allows you to choose whether to copy imported audio files to your project’s audio data directory or to link to them in their
current (external) location.
Note: External files are defined as any file not in the project’s audio data folder (or a subfolder within the project’s audio data
folder).

To configure Cakewalk to always copy files to the project Audio Data folder
If you want to keep all of your project’s audio in one folder (your project’s audio data directory), go to Edit > Preferences > File Audio Data and select the Always Copy Imported Audio Files check box.

To configure Cakewalk to share external files
Cakewalk allows you to share external files (files not in the project’s audio data directory). There are some exceptions, however.
Files that have a different sampling rate or bit depth are always copied to the project’s audio data directory. Also, if the Always Copy
Imported Audio Files option is selected in Edit > Preferences > File - Audio Data, imported audio is always copied to your
project’s audio data directory.
Do the following to ensure that you are sharing files:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - Audio Data and clear the Always Copy Imported Audio Files check box.
2. In the Open dialog box, when importing audio, make sure the Copy Audio to Project Folder option is unchecked.

Recording

You can add sound or music to a Cakewalk project in many different ways. You can record your own material using a MIDI-equipped
instrument, use a microphone or another audio input to record digital audio information, or import sound or music data from an
existing digital data file. With the Input monitoring feature, you can hear your audio instruments exactly how they sound in Cakewalk,
including any plug-in effects (effects are not recorded, however). When you record audio or MIDI tracks, Cakewalk displays a wave
preview of your recorded data as you record it.
You can also input new material using your computer keyboard or mouse using the Piano Roll view, the Staff view, or the Event List
view. For more information about entering music using these views, see “The Staff view” on page 1272, “The Piano Roll view” on
page 820, and “The Event List view” on page 887.

Creating a new project
You can add music and sound to an existing project or to a new project. Just as in any Windows program, you open an existing
project file using the File > Open command, and create a new project file using the File > New command.
When you create a new Cakewalk project, there are some additional parameters you can set to make it easier to work on your
project. These include:

 Meter and key signature
 Metronome and tempo settings
 Audio sampling rate
 MIDI timing resolution
See:
“Creating a new project file” on page 346
“Setting the Meter and Key signatures” on page 347
“Setting the Metronome and Tempo settings” on page 348
“Setting the audio sampling rate and bit depth” on page 350

Creating a new project file
Cakewalk includes a set of templates you can use to create a new project. These templates include common types of ensembles,
such as rock quartets, jazz trios, and classical full orchestras. When you create a new project using one of these templates,
Cakewalk creates a project that has MIDI settings predefined so that one track is set up for each of the instruments in the ensemble.
Cakewalk also includes a template with two MIDI and two audio tracks (called the Normal template). If you are creating a new project
that will contain only audio material, use the Audio Only template. If you are creating a new project that will contain only MIDI
material, use the MIDI Only template.
You can create your own template files and use them as the basis for other new projects. For more information, see “Templates” on
page 1258.

To create a new project file
1. Choose File > New to display the New Project File dialog box.
Figure 132. The New Project File dialog box.

2. Enter a file name, set the folder where you want to store the new file, and set the folder where you want to store the new file’s
audio.
3. Choose a template from the list.
4. Click OK.
Cakewalk creates the new project file and displays it with the Track view open.

Creating a new project

Setting the Meter and Key signatures
By default, a new Cakewalk project is in 4/4 time and the key of C major. You can change these settings to any desired “Meter” on
page 1912 or key. These settings apply to all the tracks in a project. You cannot set different meter or key signatures for different
tracks.
The meter or key signature of a project can change at any measure boundary. To insert changes in the meter or key signature, use
the Views > Meter/Key command to display the Meter/Key view, or use the Project > Insert Meter/Key Change command. You
can also click the Meter display in the Control Bar’s Transport module.
If you are creating a new project that will contain only audio material (no MIDI material), you do not need to set the meter and key
signature.
Note: Groove clips do not follow your project's key. Groove clips follow the project pitch that is specified in Project > Set Default
Groove Clip Pitch, in addition to any pitch markers in the Time Ruler. For more information, see “Working with Groove Clip
audio” on page 806.
The key signature controls how Cakewalk displays notes in the Staff view, the Event List view, and elsewhere. The meter tells
Cakewalk the number of beats per measure and the note value of each beat. Common meters include:

 2/4 (two beats per measure, each quarter note gets a beat)
 4/4 (four beats per measure, each quarter note gets a beat)
 3/4 (three beats per measure, each quarter note gets a beat)
 6/8 (six beats per measure, each eighth note gets a beat)
The top number of a meter, the number of beats per measure, can be from 1 through 99. The bottom number of a meter is the value
of each beat. You can pick from a list of values ranging from a whole note to a thirty-second note.
The meter determines the following:

 Where the metronome accents are placed
 How the Now time is displayed
 How the Staff view is drawn
 How grid lines are displayed in the Piano Roll view
To Set the Meter and Key signature
1. Click the Views menu and choose Meter/Key.
2. Click

to open the Meter/Key Signature dialog box.

The Meter/Key Signature dialog box appears.
Figure 133. The Meter/Key Signature dialog box.

3. Enter the top and bottom meter values in the Beats per Measure and Beat Value fields.
4. Choose the key signature from the Key Signature list.
5. Click OK.
You can also set the meter and key signature in the Control Bar’s Transport module, or choose Project > Insert Meter/Key Change.

Setting the Metronome and Tempo settings
The metronome counts off each beat in a measure, so you can hear the tempo of your project. You can choose to have the
metronome sound during recording, during playback, both, or turned off. When you start recording, Cakewalk can play any number
of beats or measures of metronome clicks before recording begins. This can help you “get in the groove” before you start performing.
These beats or measures are called the count-in. When you create a new project, you should set the metronome to play during the
count-in and while recording. If you are adding material to an existing project, you might only need the metronome for the count-in.
You can customize the metronome sound to use audio or any note on a MIDI instrument. By default, Cakewalk uses a hi-hat cymbal
sound from a General MIDI drum kit for the MIDI metronome, but you can change this setting to anything you like by changing the
MIDI output, MIDI channel, and duration. You can also choose the note and velocity (volume) to use for the first beat of each
measure and for all other beats. The metronome settings are stored separately with each project, so you can use different settings
for each one.
To enable or disable the metronome during playback or recording, click the Playback Metronome on/off button
Metronome on/off button

or Record

in the Control Bar’s Transport module.

Setting the audio sampling rate and bit depth
Each Cakewalk project has an audio sample rate (see “Sampling rate” on page 1914) and an audio driver bit depth (see “Bit depth”
on page 1908) that indicate the level of accuracy with which audio data are sampled and processed. The same parameters are used
for all the digital audio in a project. When you create a new project, if you do not want to use the default setting, you must choose a
sampling rate before you start recording audio.
Cakewalk lets you choose from several different sampling rates: 11025 Hz, 22050 Hz, 44100 Hz, 48000 Hz, 88200 Hz, 96000 Hz,
176400Hz, 192000 Hz, 352800 Hz, and 384000 Hz. The default used by Cakewalk is 44100 Hz, the same rate as audio CDs.
However, you may choose a higher rate and later mixdown to 44100. You can also enter any hardware-supported value in the
Sampling Rate field. Consult your hardware documentation for supported sampling rates.
A higher sampling rate produces better quality sound. However, a higher sampling rate also means that each audio clip takes up
more memory and disk space and requires more intensive processing by your computer. If you have an older computer, or a slow
hard drive, you might be better off with a lower sampling rate. For more information, see “Improving performance with digital audio”
on page 1366.
By default, the audio driver bit depth of audio data is 16 bits. If your sound card supports 18, 20, 22, or 24 bit audio, you can choose
to take advantage of these higher resolutions.
If you are creating a new project that will contain only MIDI material (no audio), you do not need to set the audio sampling rate or bit
depth. If you import audio from a Wave file or another digital audio file, the sampling rate and audio driver bit depth of the wave file
are converted to your default setting, if necessary.

To set the sampling rate and audio driver bit depth for new projects
Note: If you are planning to move your project to a Digital Audio Tape (DAT) or to some other media via a digital transfer, set
your sampling rate and bit depth to match the target unit. For example, use 44,100Hz/16-bit for a project that will be mastered
to a CD, so that no sample rate conversion is required.
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings.
2. Select a value in the Sampling Rate drop-down menu, and a value from the Audio Driver Bit Depth drop-down menu.
3. Click OK.
The sampling rate and audio driver bit depth are saved with the project file.

Sony Wave-64 support
Cakewalk fully supports reading and writing to the Sony Wave-64 format, which has a limit of 8,388,608 terabytes!
Cakewalk only creates Wave-64 file when needed. The Wave-64 format allows an application to dynamically switch from classic
RIFF WAVE to Wave-64 format even if the data was originally created as a RIFF wave file. Cakewalk detects when a file will exceed
2GB and will dynamically switch to the new Wave-64 format.
The following table shows the maximum duration for a stereo WAVE file before we hit the 2GB limit, as well as the max duration for
a stereo Wave-64 file before we hit the 8,388,608 terabyte limit.

When Wave-64 Files are created
Wave-64 files are created behind the scenes automatically under the following usage scenarios:

 When the number of samples recorded exceeds the file size limit of a 32-bit RIFF WAV file (approximately 2GB file size).
 When you export, bounce or freeze tracks or clips and the resultant wave size exceeds 2GB.
 When you destructively process audio effects on a Cakewalk clip whose duration exceeds 2GB.
 When you import audio and choose a wave file that exceeds 2GB in size (this could be a Wave-64 file).
 When you save a CWB file and the size of any chunk in the CWB file exceeds 2GB, the entire CWB is saved in the new Wave-64
format.
Note: 64-bit CWB files are incompatible with previous versions of Cakewalk.

64-bit CWB files
CWB files are RIFF files with multiple WAVE chunks. Therefore, CWB files in previous versions of Cakewalk were subject to the
same file size limitations of normal RIFF Wav files. This could potentially result in a CWB file that failed to save because a chunk was
too large.
Cakewalk will automatically use the Wave-64 format if a CWB file exceeds 2GB.
Note: 64-bit CWB files are incompatible with previous versions of Cakewalk.

Wave-64 file extension
Wave-64 files have a .w64 extension associated with them. Whenever a Wave-64 file is written, Cakewalk saves it with an extension
of w64.

CWP file persistence for 64-bit sample offsets
The Cakewalk project file format supports writing 64-bit sample offsets for regions and clips. When a project containing 64-bit
sample times is detected, saving that project automatically rewrites it in this new format.
Note: Projects that contain 64-bit sample times are incompatible with Cakewalk 6 and earlier.

Setting the MIDI timing resolution
Each Cakewalk project has a setting for the timing resolution, or timebase, that indicates the resolution of MIDI data. This resolution
is measured in ticks or pulses per quarter note and is often abbreviated as PPQ. The default resolution is 960PPQ, which is accurate
enough for most applications. In this timebase, each quarter note is represented by 960 ticks, each eighth note by 480 ticks, each
eighth-note triplet by 320 ticks, and so on.
In some projects you may need a different timebase. For example, if you wanted to use eighth-note septuplets (7 eighth notes per
quarter note) and represent them accurately, you would need to have a timebase that is divisible by 7, such as 168PPQ. Cakewalk
uses the timebase you choose for a project to determine the range of tick values in the Now time.

To set the timebase for a project
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Clock.
2. Choose the timebase you want from the Ticks per Quarter Note list.
3. Click OK.
The timebase will be saved with the project file.

Preparing to record
To prepare for recording, you need to do the following:

 Set the recording mode.
 Specify how new Take lanes are created during recording.
 Choose your input(s).
 Arm one or more tracks for recording.
 Check your recording levels (audio only).
 Tune your instrument if necessary (audio only).
 Set the Now time to the point where recording should start.
 Start recording.
After you record, you can use the Edit > Undo command to erase the most recently recorded material. You can use the Edit > Redo
command to restore the recording and toggle between Undo and Redo as many times as you like. If you are using MIDI Sync or
time code sync for the clock source, Cakewalk waits to receive external timing data before it begins recording. For more information,
see “Synchronizing your gear” on page 1335.
See:
“Recording modes” on page 352
“Choosing an input” on page 353
“Arming tracks for recording” on page 355
“Auto arming” on page 355

Recording modes
Any material you record is stored in a new clip. If you record into several tracks at once, one clip is created in each track. If you
record into a track that already contains clips, you can choose one of three recording modes to determine what happens to those
clips. When you save your project, you also save whatever recording mode you choose together with that project:
Recording mode

Record button

How it works

Comping

When recording, previously recorded material on the track is not heard. When a recording is done,
the newly recorded material is heard and all other takes are time-muted for the duration of the new
material.
Comp record mode will record all takes as independent Take lanes. At the end of a recording pass,
only the most recently recorded takes will be audible. This is achieved by automatically comping,
isolating the clips in the recording and muting other clips in existing Take lanes.
Splits are created in all lanes at the start and end record times.
All clips within the recorded region are automatically "healed", removing any unnecessary splits
from prior takes.
All clips in Take lanes that are obscured by the latest record pass are muted.
The comp splitting process follows the same logic as the Comping tool, and will mute all clips that
are not part of the latest recording.

Overwrite

The new material replaces (overwrites) any existing material. This means that portions of existing
clips may be “wiped clean” to make room for newly recorded material. While recording, you will not
be able to hear material from existing clips.

Sound on Sound

The new material is merged with any existing material. This means that any existing clips on the
track are left unchanged and all newly recorded material is stored in new clips. While recording, you
will be able to hear material from existing clips.
Note: When loop recording, you will not be able to hear the prior loop passes until you stop
recording. This is because takes are only committed after recording is stopped.

Auto Punch

Recording only takes place between the punch-in and punch-out times. You can use Auto Punch in
either Comping, Overwrite, or Sound on Sound mode.

 Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Record, then choose the desired take behavior.
The following take behaviors are available:

 Create New Lane. Always create a new lane for each take.
 Reuse Existing Lane. Reuse existing lanes for each take (this option is not available when using the Comping record mode).
 Reuse Existing Lane, Unless Takes Overlap. Reuse existing lanes for each take, and only create new lanes if takes overlap.

Choosing an input
To record into a track, you must choose an input for the music or sound to be recorded. Usually, you choose All Inputs - Omni to
record material from a MIDI instrument, or the left or right channel of a digital audio device (such as a sound card) to record audio
material, or stereo if you want to record stereo audio in a single track. The input for each track is displayed in the track’s Input field
and at the top of each module in the Console view.
When you choose All Inputs > Omni as the input for a track, Cakewalk merges material from all MIDI inputs and instruments. This
means you don’t have to worry about input, channel, or other MIDI settings. Sometimes, you may want to record different MIDI
channels into different tracks. To learn how to do this, see “Recording specific ports and channels” on page 379.
While each track can have a different input, it is also possible for several tracks to have the same input.

To choose a MIDI input in the Track view
1. Click the drop-down arrow of an Input field of a MIDI track.
A drop-down menu of MIDI inputs appears.
2. Choose an input from the following:

 None. This option actually sets the Input field to Omni with this setting the track will record any MIDI input coming in on any
enabled port (MIDI interface input driver) on any channel.

 All Inputs > (MIDI Omni or MIDI ch 1-16). With this setting the track will record any MIDI input coming in on any enabled
port (MIDI interface input driver) on any channel, unless you choose a particular MIDI channel instead of MIDI Omni. Then the
track will only record input that’s on the MIDI channel you chose.

 (name of MIDI input driver) > (MIDI Omni or MIDI ch 1-16). Choosing this option causes the track to record any MIDI
channel coming from the named MIDI interface input driver, unless you choose a particular MIDI channel instead of MIDI
Omni. Then the track will only record input that’s on the MIDI channel you chose, from the named input driver.

 Preset. If you want to record multiple data from multiple ports and/or channels, you need to select a preset collection of
those ports and channels. You can select one here (to create presets, see next line).

 Manage Presets. If you want to create or edit any preset collections of input ports and channels, you can select this option
(see “To create or edit a preset input configuration” on page 380).

 All Inputs > (MIDI Omni or MIDI ch 1-16). With this setting the track will record any MIDI input coming in on any enabled
port (MIDI interface input driver) on any channel, unless you choose a particular MIDI channel instead of MIDI Omni. Then the
track will only record input that’s on the MIDI channel you chose.

 (name of MIDI input driver) > (MIDI Omni or MIDI ch 1-16). Choosing this option causes the track to record any MIDI

Auto arming
You must arm tracks in order to record. To safeguard your data, there is no automatic arming of any tracks.
If you want to record MIDI tracks without arming a track, go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Playback and Recording and select the
Allow MIDI Recording without an Armed Track check box.
This feature lets you start recording a new track simply by making it the current track and pressing R or clicking the Record button in
the Transport module. Auto-arming makes it possible to inadvertently record over existing material in the current track, however.

Arming tracks during playback/recording
Cakewalk is able to arm and disarm tracks during playback and recording. This allows you to record to different tracks while the
transport is rolling, without first having to stop playback in order to arm a track for recording.

To allow arming during playback
Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Record and select the (global) Allow Arm Changes During Playback/Record check box.
Note: The Allow Arm Changes During Playback/Record option is disabled by default. When enabled, Cakewalk must keep
all hardware input ports open so that it can dynamically arm tracks on the fly. With some drivers in WDM mode, this can add
significant overhead if there are many input devices enabled in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Devices. This may lead to more
frequent drop outs. When using this option in WDM mode, it is recommended that you disable all unused input drivers in Edit >
Preferences > Audio - Devices to minimize this overhead. Disabling unused inputs is not required when using ASIO mode.
Cakewalk has an option that can reduce CPU overhead when the Allow Arm Changes During Playback/Record option is
enabled.
When Allow Arm Changes During Playback/Record is enabled, Cakewalk must keep all hardware input ports open so that it can
dynamically arm tracks on the fly. With some drivers in WDM mode, this can add significant overhead if there are many input devices
enabled in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Devices.
The new Only For Inputs in Project option instructs Cakewalk to only open hardware input ports that are currently active in the
project (i.e. assigned to a track).

To only open active hardware input ports
Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Record and select the Only For Inputs in Project check box.
Note: If this option is enabled, you will not be able to change inputs while recording.

Recording music from a MIDI instrument

Arpeggiator
The arpeggiator lets you play intricate patterns of notes that would otherwise be extremely difficult or impossible to play manually
and at speeds and octave ranges that exist beyond the physical limitations of the player or keyboard range.
Arpeggiated events are new events that are based on notes that you play on your controller keyboard. The new events are
rhythmically and harmonically specified by the arpeggiator’s preset, allowing you to “play” an endless variety sophisticated musical
passages with simple key pressing.
The most significant capability of the arpeggiator is its ability to apply algorithmic variations on your input as well as MIDI-based
patterns.
In addition to note events, the arpeggiator can send parameter automation such as pan, volume, and even effects automation for the
current track.
Each MIDI and instrument track has its own integrated arpeggiator, visually located in the Track view. Running multiple arpeggiators
across tracks can help realize exciting melodic and rhythmic textures.
The arpeggiator controls are accessed in the Track Inspector.
Figure 137. Arpeggiator controls are available in the Track Inspector.

Arpeggiator controls
The following table describes the controls in the Arpeggiator.

Arpeggiator

Control

Description

Octave Range

Sets the number of octaves through which the arpeggio will play. A value of 1 means that a held chord will only arpeggiate the
notes that are being held within the octave from which the notes are being transmitted. A value of 2 means a held chord will
arpeggiate for two octaves. The held chord always represents the bass octave, meaning that the other octaves sound in a
higher register.
If you specify a range higher than the standard MIDI specifications, the Arpeggiator will repeat the pattern in the highest
available octave as necessary.
This control can be assigned to MIDI remote control and modified in real-time during project playback.

Latch

Latch keeps the arpeggio playing after you let go of the keys.
This control can be assigned to MIDI remote control and modified in real-time during project playback.

Swing

Sets the amount of swing applied to the selected pattern. You can make a pattern of 8th, 16th, or 32nd notes play back as
swing notes instead of straight notes. The amount of swing ranges from 0 (no swing) to 100% (maximum swing).

Velocity

An offset control that scales the arpeggiated note’s velocity to a percentage of the original note velocity.

Duration

Controls whether the notes in the pattern are held to their full value, or are held for shorter or longer durations.

Pitch Offset

A transposition control in half-steps, up or down a maximum of 2 octaves.

Flam Amount

If a pattern contains flams, this menu controls how big a difference there is between the attack time of the flam and the note
it is attached to.

Source Mix

When 0, simultaneously held notes arpeggiate as single notes. At 50%, simultaneously held notes are heard as a chord in
addition to the usual arpeggiated notes, both at equal levels. At 100%, only the held chord is audible.
Control: Knob (0 – 100%); this control can be assigned to MIDI remote control and modified in real-time during project
playback.

Ch

MIDI input and output menu—the Arpeggiator only affects input data that’s on the MIDI channels listed on this menu. The
arpeggiator always obeys the track’s assigned output channel, plus any additional channels specified in the arpeggiators Ch

Using patterns and presets
Pre-authored patterns are used to apply rhythmic and melodic variations to the arpeggio. Cakewalk includes many professionallyauthored pattern files for you to experiment with. Pattern files have a .ptn file extension.
An Arpeggiator preset stores a pattern along with the current Arpeggiator parameter settings. Preset files have a .arp file extension.
You use the Arpeggiator’s Preset control to load patterns and load/save presets.
When playing back through the Arpeggiator, the first pitch in the pattern is moved to the lowest note currently played.
Note: If the pattern file is a Free Mode pattern, the steps are quantized to the nearest 128th note value in order to better
preserve timing nuances.

Recording and editing arpeggiator automation on an instrument track
You can not record or edit automation data on an instrument track. To use automation on an instrument track, you must first split the
instrument track into separate audio and MIDI tracks, create or edit the automation data on the MIDI track, then recombine the tracks
into an instrument track. For details, see “Splitting an instrument track to separate audio and MIDI tracks” on page 954 and
“Converting an audio and MIDI track to a single instrument track” on page 954.
See:
“Arpeggiator” on page 358

Recording audio
Before you record audio, you should check your input levels. If the levels are too low, you may end up with too much hiss and
background noise in your recording. If the levels are too high, your recording will be inaccurate or distorted. To check your audio
levels, use the audio meters in the either the Track view, Track Inspector or Console view. To adjust the input levels, you must use
your sound card’s software mixer program (or the Windows 7 mixer) or an external hardware mixer for certain sound cards.
The audio meters indicate the volume at which the audio will be recorded, in units called decibels (dB). The meter values range from
-INF (silent) to 0 dB (maximum volume). You can change many options in the way Cakewalk’s meters display data: see “Metering”
on page 1000. To maximize the dynamic range of your recording, you want to set the levels as high as possible without clipping.
When the audio level exceeds 0 dB, some of the audio information is lost. This is known as overload. Many sound cards use
clipping to deal with an overloaded signal, but clipping can distort the audio signal. As a result, you should avoid letting the meter
level exceed 0 dB.
Note: Because Cakewalk is a digital recorder, a level of 0 dB indicates digital zero. Digital distortion will occur at 0 dB. You will
not get analog compression or warmth from pushing the input levels. If you are transferring data from a DAT or another device,
you may want to calibrate the input levels of your sound card with the output levels of other devices in your studio. This will
ensure that 0 dB on one unit will appear as 0 dB in Cakewalk.

To check the Input levels
1. In the Track view, choose the inputs for the tracks you want to record, and arm the tracks for recording. The default meter range
is from 0 dB to -60 dB. To change the range, right-click on the meter and choose a new range from the menu.
2. Perform at the loudest level at which you plan to record.
3. Watch the meters respond. Increase the input volume as high as possible without ever letting the meters move all the way to 0
dB, even for an instant, or letting the Clipping indicator turn red. If either of these things happen, reduce the input volume just
enough to avoid them during the entire performance. Note that some kinds of audio, such as percussive or plucked musical
instruments, can produce very short, high-level “transients” when struck or plucked aggressively, which can lead to clipping if the
input volume is set too high. Consider the possibility of these transients when examining the meters and setting your record level.
Note: If the Clipping indicator is illuminated, click on it to reset.

Once you have set your sampling rate and input levels, you are ready to start recording. If the meters do not move, check your
sound card software’s mixer program and make sure that you have the proper input enabled for recording.
When you record audio, Cakewalk stores each audio clip in a separate file. These files have the same format as a Wave (.wav) file,
but they have special names and are stored in a separate directory on your hard disk. Cakewalk automatically manages these audio
files for you, making it easier for you to manage your projects. If you want to work with these files directly, or to learn more about how
Cakewalk stores audio data, see “System configuration” on page 1356.

Important: Make sure you have enough space on your hard disk when recording digital audio. Running out of hard disk space
when recording can lead to unpredictable results.

Confidence recording and waveform preview
When you’re recording audio or MIDI data, Cakewalk gives you many visual cues that tracks are armed and that Cakewalk is

When one or more tracks are armed:

 The Arm button in each armed track turns red.
 The Clips pane next to each armed track gets a reddish hue.
 The Arm / Disarm All Tracks button

the Control Bar’s Mix module is lit.

While you’re recording, Cakewalk displays these cues:

 Audio tracks display a waveform preview in the area in the Clips pane where you’re recording. This is actually a visual record of
the record meter’s progress. When you stop recording, Cakewalk displays the actual waveform, which is slightly different from the
preview. The preview is a snapshot taken at certain time intervals, while the actual waveform represents all the data that is
recorded.

 MIDI tracks display the actual data that they record, both in the Clips pane and the Piano Roll view (not the Staff view).
 Automation envelopes and nodes are drawn in real time as the automation data is being recorded.
If you want to turn off the real-time display of audio clips, see the following procedure.

Input monitoring
Being able to hear plug-in audio effects applied to a live signal is an exciting feature of Cakewalk. However, there are two issues that
users commonly stumble upon when using the input monitoring feature. The first is that the monitored signal seems to have an
echo associated with it. The second is that live input monitoring can lead to nasty feedback problems, particularly if you have an
outboard audio mixer, or you record from a different sound card from the one you are playing back with.
Cakewalk has several buttons to control input monitoring:

 Per-track Input Echo button. Each audio track has an Input Echo button
 Global Input Echo button. The Input Echo On/Off All Tracks button

that turns that track’s input monitoring on or off.
in the Control Bar’s Mix module turns input

monitoring on or off on all audio tracks with one click.

 Audio Engine button. To disable all audio activity in Cakewalk, including input monitoring, click the Audio Engine on/off
button

in the Control Bar’s Mix module so it dims.

Note: When you use input monitoring, make sure that the track you’re playing through uses the same audio interface (sound
card) for both input and output. Using different audio interfaces for a track’s input and output can produce distortion during input
monitoring.
To understand the echo and feedback problems, let’s look at how audio signals travel through your sound card, the drivers, and
Cakewalk. The following diagram depicts a simplified version of this signal flow.

Cakewalk

The bottom block of the picture represents the sound card. The shaded area above it represents the audio drivers. The unshaded
area at the top represents the main environment of the operating system.
As the diagram shows, analog audio flows into the card's line input (on the left), and is immediately split in two. One branch goes up
through the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), where the audio is digitized, buffered and fed to the driver (labeled Wave In in the
diagram).
The digital audio data buffers are read by Cakewalk from the Wave In driver, processed, and then sent out to the Wave Out driver.
The driver passes the digital audio buffers through a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), where the audio data is converted back to an
analog signal.
Finally, this analog output signal is mixed with the original branch of the input analog signal, and the summed result is presented to
the sound card's line output.
With this information in hand, let's follow a simple audio signal through the system to understand how echoes get introduced into the
input monitor path.
Suppose you are counting “1, 2, 3" into your sound card very quickly. When you say the first “1,” this sound immediately appears in
all the places indicated in the illustration above. In other words, the analog audio signal is pure electrical signal traveling at the speed
of light, so it is immediately present across all analog audio paths inside the sound card.

364

Recording
Input monitoring

say “1”

Cakewalk

Next, you say “2.” In the time it takes you do that, the ADC has converted the “1” to digital form and the Wave In driver has fed it to
Cakewalk for processing. Cakewalk processes the buffer right away and passes the processed data right back to the Wave Out
driver.
say “2”
Cakewalk

Finally, you say “3.” By this time the original “1” has been converted back to analog audio by the DAC, and that analog signal is
mixed in with the “3” you have just said. The ultimate result is that you hear a “1” and “3” mixed together at the line output of card—
seemingly sounding like an echo, but actually just an artifact of the signal flow through the system.
say “3”

Cakewalk

You can eliminate the echo by muting the line-in from playing back (see “To eliminate the echo from input monitoring” on page 366);
you’ll send only the processed signal to the sound card outputs. This technique introduces a little extra latency to what you hear
coming out of your sound card, but if you use WDM or ASIO drivers with your sound cards, the latency is negligible.
The feedback problem results whenever you have a loop in your mixer path: the output of your mixer is patched into the input of your
sound card. Feedback can happen with or without input monitoring, but since input monitoring can add several levels of gain to the
signal flow, it’s of greater concern when you have input monitoring enabled. Input monitoring is disabled by default when you install
Cakewalk, and you enable it with the following procedure.

Recording
Input monitoring

365

To enable input monitoring
 Turn your speakers down, and on an audio track that you want to monitor, click the Input Echo button so that it’s lit up (on)

. To

disable monitoring for this track, click the button off.
Or

 Turn your speakers down, then click the Input Echo On/Off All Tracks

button in the Control Bar’s Mix module. This enables
input monitoring on all tracks. To disable monitoring for all tracks, click the button again.

Now you can hear your instrument in real time with any plug-in effects that you want to patch into the current track. You might also
hear an echo, because the dry signal is coming out of your sound card slightly ahead of the processed signal. To eliminate the dry
signal, see the next procedure.

To eliminate the echo from input monitoring
1. Open the Windows Volume Control window:

 Windows 7: Click the Windows Start button and go to Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Volume Control.
The Volume Control window appears.
2. In the Play Control window of the mixer, select the Mute check box in the Line-In column, or in the column of whatever jack your
instrument is plugged into, and close the mixer window.
Now you can hear only the processed sound when you use input monitoring. Using WDM or ASIO drivers for your sound card keeps
latency to a negligible amount.
Note: This procedure does not eliminate feedback from your system, only the echo. If you experience feedback, you have a
feedback loop somewhere in your mixer setup.

To enable input monitoring when arming tracks

Warning: Be extremely careful when enabling input monitoring on an armed track if you are working in a room that contains
both live microphones and studio monitors. In such a scenario, enabling input monitoring on an armed track can result in an
extremely loud feedback loop between the microphones and monitors and can damage your ears and speakers.
Cakewalk makes it possible to automatically enable input monitoring when arming a track for recording. To do so, hold down the
SHIFT key while you click on a track’s Arm button
will disable input monitoring.

. Likewise, holding down the SHIFT key while disabling record during playback

To automatically disable input monitoring during playback
Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording and clear the Disable Input Monitoring During Playback check
box.
When this option is enabled, input monitoring will be disabled on all tracks during playback but not during recording.

Input monitoring

Live Input PDC override
While working with virtual instruments and live input monitored tracks, it is important for audio to be streamed at low latency in order
to minimize delay.
Although Cakewalk supports streaming audio at very low latency, there are cases where internal buffering can cause additional
latency. The most common scenario is when using plug-ins that require Automatic Plug-in Delay Compensation (PDC). PDC is the
process of delay compensating other normal tracks so they are synchronized with the delayed audio produced by the plug-ins.
Whenever delay compensation takes place on a track that has a live input (an input monitored track or synth track), it is delayed by
the required amount to synchronize it with other tracks. In some cases, the delay can be noticeable and make live tracking difficult.
The Live Input PDC Override toggle lets you disable delay compensation on live tracks, thereby removing the latency during
playback and recording of such tracks. Since it's a toggle, you can quickly turn it on to complete your tracking at low latency, and turn
it off when finished to hear the track compensated as normal.
Regardless of whether Live Input PDC Override is enabled or disabled, recorded audio is placed on the timeline at the correct
position as recorded.
Live Input PDC Override is ignored during a bounce/export or freeze operations.
Tip: You can control which tracks are delay overridden by enabling input monitoring only for those tracks. For more information, see
“Input monitoring” on page 364.

To enable/disable live input PDC override
 Do one of the following:
 Click the Live Input PDC Override button

in the Control Bar’s Mix module.

 Press SHIFT+E.
Figure 139. The Mix module.

Delay compensation is enabled/disabled on all live input tracks in the project. All other tracks have normal delay compensation
applied.

Note: If the live track being monitored also contains track data (or MIDI data in the case of a synth track), the streamed track
data will not be delay compensated. As a result the recorded track data will not be in sync with other tracks. You should either
mute any clips on the live tracks, work with an empty region of the track, or use an entirely new track while recording.
Some signal routings can cause tracks to be out of sync when Live Input PDC Override is enabled. To prevent any potential sync
problems, follow these suggestions:

 Output the live input tracks directly to the final bus in the signal flow.
 Send live tracks directly to a hardware main.
PDC re-sync
Some plug-ins, such as iZotope Ozone 4 and various UAD plug-ins, change their internal delay (PDC) dynamically when certain
parameters are modified, presets are changed or internal plug-in routing is changed. When a plug-in changes its internal delay,
Cakewalk will detect this and re-sync all tracks in the project to this new delay value. While this is done you may hear a momentary
interruption in playing audio. This is normal and required in order to keep tracks in sync and delay compensated.

The Audio Engine button
Cakewalk has a button in the Control Bar’s Transport module called the Audio Engine button
. This button lets you turn
Cakewalk’s audio engine off if you’re getting distortion or feedback and want to cut the sound off. When playback or recording are in
progress, Cakewalk enables the button automatically—however, the button appears grayed-out during playback or recording
because you can’t control the button at that time.
If you experience feedback during input monitoring, you can click the Audio Engine button to turn off the audio engine. However, if
playback or recording are in progress, the button is unavailable, and you should click the Reset button
that’s just to the right of it
instead, or else stop recording or playback first and then click the Audio Engine button.
You may experience slightly better playback and recording performance by turning the Audio Engine button off before you press the
Play or Record buttons. This happens if your computer’s resources are already stretched to the limit. When you start recording or
playback with the audio engine already functioning, there is still some processing that Cakewalk has to do that’s left over when you
start the transport. This places an extra load on your system that can cause dropouts if your system is already stretched thin. A more
effective solution than disabling the audio engine before starting the transport is to reduce the load on your system by hiding some
meters, increasing latency slightly, reducing the number of plug-ins and/or tracks, etc.

Loop recording
When recording a vocal or an instrumental section, you might want to record several different takes so that you can choose the one
you like best. You might even want to record several takes to double a part or merge the best parts of each.
Normally, to record each take you would have to arm a track, start recording, perform the take, and then stop recording. You can
record multiple takes more easily using a feature called loop recording. Loop recording lets you start recording and record as many
takes as you like, all in a single step.
Cakewalk loops between the loop start and loop end time, allowing you to record one take on each pass. Cakewalk creates a clip for
each take. You have three choices for where these clips are stored:

 All clips can be recorded in Sound on Sound mode and stored in a single track, where they are stacked on top of one another. You
can use Take lanes to display overlapping clips in separate lanes.
Note: When loop recording in Sound on Sound mode, you will not be able to hear the prior loop passes until you stop recording.
This is because takes are only committed after recording is stopped.

 All clips can be recorded in Overwrite mode in a single track, where each take is successively muted except the last one.
 Each clip can be recorded to a different track. Cakewalk automatically places each take into a new, empty track. No existing
tracks are changed in any way.
When you finish recording, you can use the Edit > Undo command or CTRL+Z to erase all your takes in a single step.

To use loop recording
1. Choose the input for the track(s) you want to record, and arm the track(s) for recording.
2. Set the loop start and end times in the Control Bar’s Loop module.

3. Right-click the Record button

Punch recording
Suppose you are happy with most of a track but want to replace some sound or add new material in one small section—perhaps as
small as a couple of notes. This is where punch recording comes in handy, because it lets you record new material only within a
specified range of times.
For example, suppose you recorded a 32-bar keyboard solo but made some mistakes in the 24th and 25th bars. With punch
recording, you can play the entire solo again, so you make sure you can get the feel you want. However, only the bars you want to
correct are actually recorded. That way, you don’t have to worry about introducing new mistakes elsewhere in the recording.
To use punch recording, follow these steps:

 Enable punch recording.
 Set the start and end times of the punch.
 Choose Comping, Sound on Sound mode or Overwrite mode.
 Start recording by pressing R or clicking the

button on the Control Bar’s Transport module.

The Control Bar’s Punch module shows the punch settings, as shown here:
Figure 141. The Punch module.

A. Auto-Punch On/Off B. Set Punch Time to Select C. Punch In Time D. Punch Out Time

When punch recording is enabled, the punch times are indicated by special markers in the Time Ruler, which is at the top of the
Clips pane:
A

B

A. Punch In B. Punch Out

After you punch record, choosing Edit > Undo both discards any new material you recorded and restores the original material that
had been deleted.
You can also combine loop and punch recording to record several takes of a punch. Say you are working on that perfect take of a
guitar solo and you need to hear a couple of bars of the project as “pre-roll” before you punch in. By combining looping with punch,
you can have each take begin before you start to play and still have the solo cut in at the appropriate instant.
In the example mentioned previously, you could loop from bar 17 to bar 27 but record only bars 24 and 25. Here’s what this looks
like:

Recording
Punch recording

When punch recording, Cakewalk saves the entire recording while the transport is rolling, but the recorded clip is cropped to only
expose the punch region. By also recording the pre-roll and post-roll, you have more flexibility later when it comes to slip-editing and
cross-fading the clip because you have access to audio data before and after the punch region instead of only silence.
If loop recording and punch recording are used simultaneously, only the first and last takes can be slip-edited to expose hidden
material.

Note: Although Cakewalk records while the transport is rolling, visual feedback (confidence recording) is only shown within the
punch region. If recording is stopped before the punch in point is reached, Cakewalk discards the recorded data.

To punch record
1. Choose the input(s) for the track(s) you want to record, and arm the track(s) for recording.
2. Enable the Auto Punch on/off button

in the Control Bar’s Punch module.

Step recording
Step recording is a method of recording MIDI notes one note or chord at a time. It’s a very easy and precise way to record, but can
sound mechanical if used in the wrong situation. You use step recording in its typical form by choosing a step size, such as a quarter
note, and then playing a note on your MIDI keyboard. When you play the note, Cakewalk records the note, and moves the insertion
point forward by the distance of the step size (moving the insertion point every time you press a note is the default behavior). You
can then record more notes of the same duration by playing notes on your keyboard, or you can change the step size while you’re
recording and record different size notes. You can also choose how long the notes you play will sound, as a percentage of the step
size. For example, even though you record some notes that have a step size of a quarter note, if you set the Duration field to 50%,
the notes will be recorded and displayed as a series of eighth notes, each followed by an eighth rest. The insertion point for each
recorded note in this example moves by a quarter note (the step size) each time you record a note. If the duration is longer than the
step size, the notes will overlap with the notes recorded at the next step.
Cakewalk displays your step-recorded notes in the Staff view, Piano Roll view, Event List, and Clips pane in real time as you step
record them. Cakewalk also lets you:

 Use other commands while step recording
Note: Cakewalk doesn't respond to sync signals while the Step Record dialog box is open and enabled.

 Change tracks while recording
 Add two step sizes together by pressing the + key between each step size selection
 Delete as many step-recorded notes as you want, while moving the insertion point back through the steps you delete
 Configure step recording key bindings (see “Step record keyboard Shortcuts” on page 377)
 Make any kind of tuplet
 Create a custom step size lasting any number of ticks (ticks are divisions of a beat—Cakewalk uses 960 by default); Cakewalk
will remember the custom step size until you change it

 Move the insertion point by beats, measures, or step size
 Link the position of the Now Time to the insertion point
 Offset the insertion point by the number of ticks that you specify
 Randomize duration
 Record notes with constant pitch, and/or velocity, and/or channel
 Hold notes across steps
Tip: By using keyboard shortcuts, you can leave your left hand on your MIDI keyboard to enter notes with, and control most step
recording functions with your right hand on the NumPad.
MIDI data is recorded using step record even if the track is not armed. Loop markers are ignored. And step recording always uses
the Sound on Sound (blend) record mode, regardless of the current record mode.
With Auto Advance disabled, you must click Advance each time you want to advance to the next step. While this requires more
effort, it also provides you with more flexibility. For example, with Auto Advance disabled, you do not even need to play the notes at
a single step at the same time! You can play any number of notes one at a time, and they will all be recorded at the same step until
you click the Advance button. You can even record notes of different durations at the same step—simply record the notes of one
duration, change the duration, and play more notes, without clicking Advance.
The Step Record dialog box has two modes: Basic (smaller with fewer options), and Advanced (larger, more options). To use Basic
mode, click the Bas./Adv. button so that the Adv. button is displayed. To use Advanced mode, click the Bas./Adv. button so that the
Bas. button is displayed.

4. Set the insertion point by doing one or more of the following:

 Click the Step Advance button

to move the insertion point forward by the current step size, or click the Step Backwards

button
to move the insertion point backward by the current step size. Cakewalk displays the insertion point location in the
Insertion point location field (see Basic mode picture above).

 Drag the position slider left or right to move the insertion point one measure at a time.
 Type a location in MBT (Measure-Beat-Tick) format in the Insertion point location field.
5. Choose a step size by doing one of the following:

 For common step sizes, click one of the notehead icons to choose a step size as large as a whole note

or as small as a

64th note
. You can increase the step size you choose by 50% or 75% by clicking the dot icon
, or double-dot icon
respectively. You can add different step sizes together by holding down the CTRL key while you click extra icons, or by
pressing the + key on the NumPad.

,

 For a tuplet step size, click a notehead icon to choose the “tuplet unit” (for example, for eighth-note triplets, choose an eighth
note). Then enable the Tuplet check box and fill in the “n” in time of “n” fields. For example, if you want quarter-note triplets,
click the quarter-note icon

, enable the Tuplet check box, and fill in 3 in the time of 2, which means 3 quarter notes in the

time of 2 quarter notes. If you want eighth-note triplets, click the eighth-note icon
, enable the Tuplet check box, and fill in 3
in the time of 2. If you wanted 5 notes in one beat, click the quarter-note icon, enable the Tuplet check box, and fill in 5 in the
time of 1.

 If you want to create a custom step size, click the n button

, and fill in the number of ticks in the Ticks field.

6. Choose a duration by doing one of the following:

 If you want duration and step size to be the same, enable the Follow Step Size check box.
 If you want duration and step size to be different, disable the Follow Step Size check box and fill in a percentage value in the
% of Note Value field.
7. Choose a destination track for your recording in the Destination Track field.
8. If you want the insertion point to advance automatically when you play your MIDI controller, enable the Auto Advance check
box.
9. Play a note or chord on your MIDI controller. When you release the note(s), the insertion point moves by the step size, if the Auto
Advance check box is enabled. If Auto Advance is not enabled, you can release the notes and record more notes, or you can
use the Navigation controls to advance the insertion point. If you are still holding down a note or notes when you advance the
insertion point, the step size of the held notes is extended by the current step size.
10. Continue recording notes of the same step size and duration to the same track, or change any of those parameters and continue
recording. To create a rest, advance the insertion point without playing any notes. To delete notes on previous steps, you can
press CTRL+Z for each recorded step. If you want to delete previous steps and move the insertion point back at the same time,
select the Delete on Back Step check box, and click the Step Backward button.
11. When you’re finished recording, close the dialog by clicking the X icon in the upper right corner, or by pressing SHIFT+R.
You can press CTRL+Z during or after recording to undo your recording one step at a time.
Note: Options that you choose in Advanced mode, such as Link to Now Time, are still in force when you use Basic mode.

Step pattern recording
The Pattern option lets you define a repeating rhythmic pattern of notes and rests so that you can use step recording more
efficiently. For example, suppose your project is in 4/4 time, and one track has a pattern that is two measures long: quarter notes in
the first measure and on the first two beats of the second measure, followed by a half-note rest on the last two beats. This pattern
has six quarter notes followed by two quarter-note rests.
When you use step recording with Auto Advance, you can play the six quarter notes and Cakewalk will automatically advance to
the next step. However, to skip over the rests, you need to click the Advance button two times.
With pattern recording, you define a pattern that indicates where the rests appear in the pattern. Cakewalk will then skip over the
rests automatically, so you don’t need to click the Advance button at all.
Cakewalk displays patterns as a combination of digits (which represent beats that contain notes) and dots (which represent beats
that contain rests). The pattern described previously looks like this:
123456..
Here is another example:
12.4
This pattern automatically skips over every third beat; Cakewalk interprets this pattern as “one, two, rest, four.”
Here is one final example based on 4/4 time, with a step size of eighth-note triplets (twelve steps per measure):
1234.67.90.2
No matter how you enter a pattern, Cakewalk displays the digits in sequence, with periods replacing digits at each step where a rest
would occur. You can create patterns with up to 64 steps.

To use pattern-based step recording
1. Click the Record button

and keep the button pressed for a brief moment until the pop-up menu appears, then choose Step

Record. The Record button changes to
2. Click the Step Record button

4. Click in the Pattern field.
5. Press any number key to indicate a beat at which notes will be played.
6. Press the SPACEBAR, period, or the letter R to indicate a beat on which there is a rest.
7. When the pattern is complete, click elsewhere in the dialog box.
8. Step record as before.
From now on, after you record each step, Cakewalk automatically advances past all rests to the next step on which notes will be
played. If you change step sizes while recording, the size of each rest changes also. To stop pattern-based step recording, simply
delete the pattern from the Pattern box. Cakewalk stores up to 10 patterns in the Pattern field.

Recording specific ports and channels
Most MIDI instruments are capable of sending information on several different channels at once. By default, Cakewalk merges all
incoming MIDI data and records it on whatever MIDI tracks are armed. However, Cakewalk also allows you to control which MIDI
input ports and channels each track will record. Here are some examples of when this feature might be useful:

 There are several performers, each playing a different MIDI instrument. By setting each instrument to transmit MIDI on a different
channel and/or port, you can record each player’s performance into a separate track, even though they are all playing at the same
time.

 You are using a MIDI guitar controller and want to record the notes played on each string on a separate track.
 Your electronic keyboard has a built-in auto accompaniment feature that plays a drum part and an accompaniment while you play
lead. You want to record each of these three parts into a different track in a Cakewalk project.

 You have a MIDI sequence stored on your synthesizer’s built-in sequencer, and you want to record each channel onto a different
track.
You can use external MIDI synchronization to automate the process of loading multichannel sequences from other MIDI
devices. For more information, see “Synchronizing your gear” on page 1335.
You select MIDI inputs for a track by using the Input control in the Track view, Track Inspector or Console view.
Cakewalk allows you to filter MIDI input so that you can record only certain kinds of MIDI data (see “Input filtering” on page 380), and
also allows you to automatically turn off the Local On setting of your master keyboard.

To assign input ports and channels to MIDI tracks
1. Click a track’s Input control to display the Input drop-down menu. Choose track inputs from these choices:

 None. This option actually sets the Input field to Omni. With this setting the track will record any MIDI input coming in on
any enabled port (MIDI interface input driver) on any channel.

 All Inputs > (MIDI Omni or MIDI ch 1-16). With this setting the track will record any MIDI input coming in on any enabled
port (MIDI interface input driver) on any channel, unless you choose a particular MIDI channel instead of MIDI Omni. Then the
track will only record input that’s on the MIDI channel you chose.

 (name of MIDI input driver) > (MIDI Omni or MIDI ch 1-16). Choosing this option causes the track to record any MIDI
channel coming from the named MIDI interface input driver, unless you choose a particular MIDI channel instead of MIDI
Omni. Then the track will only record input that’s on the MIDI channel you chose, from the named input driver.

 Preset. If you’ve created any preset collections of input ports and channels, you can select one here.
 Manage Presets. If you want to create or edit any preset collections of input ports and channels, you can select this option
(see following procedure).
2. Click OK.
Cakewalk shows new track inputs in the Input fields in the Track pane.

Recording
Recording specific ports and channels

379

To create or edit a preset input configuration
1. In the Input field of a track that you want to select inputs for, click the drop-down arrow and choose Manage Presets from the
drop-down menu (this menu is also available from the MIDI Inputs button in the Track Inputs dialog).
The MIDI Input Presets dialog box appears.
2. In the Input Port column, find the input port that you want to use for this track (if you only use a single-port MIDI interface, you’ll
only see one choice).
3. To the right of the input port, select the MIDI channels that you want this track to respond to on this MIDI port. Clicking the OMNI
button in this row of MIDI channels clears or fills all the check boxes in this row.
4. Select channels for any other MIDI port that’s listed, if you want to use channels on that port also.
5. If you want to save this configuration, type a name for it in the window at the top of the dialog box, and click the disk icon to save
it.
Now, when you choose inputs for other tracks, you can choose the preset you saved by clicking the Presets option in the track’s
Input drop-down menu. If you want to edit a preset, select it in the top window of the MIDI Input Presets dialog box, edit it, and click
the disk icon. If you want to delete a preset, select it in the same dialog box and click the X button to delete it.

Input filtering
Cakewalk lets you filter out specific types of MIDI messages or filter the MIDI input stream channel by channel. Any MIDI information
that is filtered out is neither recorded nor echoed to any other MIDI devices.
You can use the message type filter to screen out resource-intensive MIDI messages like key and channel aftertouch. By default,
Cakewalk records all types of events except these two.
You can use message-type filtering to record short System Exclusive (Sysx) messages in real-time. These will end up in the track as
Sysx data events, which can hold System Exclusive messages up to 255 bytes. Leave the Buffers setting at 128 unless you
experience data not being recorded. For more information about Sysx, see “System exclusive data” on page 1325.

To filter event types
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Playback and Recording.
2. Check the message types you want recorded.
3. Click OK.
From now on, Cakewalk records only the types of events you have chosen.

Importing music and sound
While recording is perhaps the most common way of adding material to a Cakewalk project, there are several other methods you
can also use. Cakewalk lets you import music into a project from several different types of digital data files, including MIDI files; audio
files in Wave, MP3, AIFF, and other formats; audio CD tracks and other Cakewalk project files.

Cakewalk lets you insert digital audio information into any track of a project. If the audio file you are importing is in stereo, then it can
be imported into a single stereo track, a pair of mono tracks or a single mono track.
The File > Import > Audio command supports the following digital audio file types:

 Wave (extension .wav)
 Sony Wave64 (extension .w64)
 RIFF 64 (extension .rf64)
 Apple AIFF (extensions .aif, .aifc and .aiff)
 Apple Core Audio Format (extension .caf)
 MPEG (extensions mp2, .mp3, .mpg, .mpeg, and .m4a)
 Windows Media (extensions .asf, .wm, .wma and .wmv)
 NeXT/Sun (extensions .au and .snd)
 FLAC (extension .flac)
 OGG (extension .oga)
 Sound Designer II (extension .sd2)
 ReCycle (extensions .rcy, .rex and .rx2)
 DSD (Direct Stream Digital) (extensions .dsf and .dff)
Note: You cannot preview DSD files from the Import Audio dialog box.

The sampling rate and bit depth for a project is set based on your default settings in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings.
If the sampling rate from the Wave file does not match the sampling rate in your project, then it will be converted to the current
project’s sampling rate and bit depth.

To import an audio file
1. Set the Now time and current track to indicate where the audio should be placed.
2. Choose File > Import > Audio to display the Open dialog box.
3. Choose the audio file you want to import. Cakewalk displays information about the file at the bottom of the dialog box.
4. Click Play to listen to the audio file before importing.
5. If the new file is stereo, select the Import as mono tracks check box if you want to insert the file into two separate tracks.
6. Click Open.
Cakewalk loads the audio data from the audio file and places it in the selected track at the Now time.

Importing OMF projects
With OMFI (Open Media Framework Interchange) support & Broadcast WAVE support Cakewalk lets you collaborate and exchange
project files with users of other programs and platforms. Support for OMFI and Broadcast Wave files provides cross-platform
compatibility with OMFI host applications such as Pro Tools, Avid and Logic systems. Cakewalk also exports projects as OMF files
that you can open in Pro Tools and other audio software.
Cakewalk allows you to select sample rate and bit depth during OMF import.
A few general guidelines for preparing OMF files for import into Cakewalk:

 OMF version 2 is preferred.
 AIFC can take slightly longer to open, as the data must be converted to WAVE on read, so WAVE is the best choice.
 If exporting from Avid Xpress DV, select “embed” (not “link”) when exporting the OMF file, and don't include any video.
OMF explained
The OMF format, or OMFI (Open Media Framework Interchange, means the same as OMF), is a file format that can be read by
many professional-level audio programs. OMF files contain two basic types of information:

 Audio and/or video files, referred to as media
 Information needed to put the media data in sequence—known as the Composition
The OMF file supplies the following data and information:

 Tracks
 Clip positions—an OMF file's EDL edit resolution can be either frame accurate or sample accurate. Cakewalk can read either, but
always writes sample accurate. The clip position is specified in absolute samples.

 Slip edits
 Fades and crossfades (as destructive edits)—Cakewalk renders any fades when it writes OMFs, creating separate clips for any
fade-ins or fade-outs. Cakewalk slip-edits the original clip to make room for the fade-in and fade-out clips. If you export to an audio
program that supports slip editing, the user can delete the fade clips and roll out the original clip to return to the original raw audio
(without fades) if desired.

 Sample rate and audio bit depth, but only if the media are embedded in the OMF
The OMF file does NOT supply the following data and information:

 Volume and pan envelopes—OMF does actually support limited automation. However, as with Nuendo and most other OMF host
programs, gains and pans are ignored (on both read and write) in Cakewalk as they are only supported on MONO tracks (OMF
limitation).

 Plug-in effects.
 MIDI data
 Tempo
Whoever supplies the OMF file that you want to open in Cakewalk should also send along a text file containing all pertinent
information about the project, especially tempo.

384

Recording
Importing music and sound

To open OMF files in Cakewalk
1. Use the File > Open command, which opens the Open dialog box.
2. In the Files of type field, select OMF File.
3. Navigate to the folder that contains your OMF files, select the OMF file you want to open, and then click the Open button, which
opens the Unpack OMF dialog box.
4. If you know the exact tempo of the file, enter it into the Initial Tempo field. It is always preferable to know and enter the project
tempo at this point. If you don't know the project tempo you can open the file at the default tempo and then change the file's
tempo later, but this will cause the clips to move.
5. The Sample Rate field displays the sample rate of the imported audio (if the audio is embedded in the OMF). Use this field to
change the sample rate, if you need to.
6. The Bit Depth field displays the bit depth of the imported audio if the audio is embedded. If the audio is external, the Bit Depth
field defaults to the Original menu option, which will import the audio at the bit depth the audio is currently using. If you want to
import the audio at a different bit depth, you can choose the bit depth in this field.
7. Click OK.
Cakewalk opens the OMF file.
You can also export Cakewalk projects as OMF files (File > Export > OMF command).
See “Exporting OMF files” on page 1149.

Importing MIDI files
You can create a new Cakewalk project from a MIDI file simply by opening the file. Cakewalk takes material from the file and places
it into one or more tracks in the Track view.

To import data from a MIDI file into a project
1. Open the MIDI file as a new, separate project.
2. Choose Edit > Select > All.
3. Choose Edit > Copy Special to display the Copy dialog box.
4. Make sure that Events in Tracks is checked. If you don’t want to import tempo changes, meter/key changes, or markers,
uncheck those options. Click OK.
5. Open the target project, or click in the Track view for that project.
6. Set the Now time and current track to indicate where the material should be placed.
7. Choose Edit > Paste Special to display the Paste dialog box.
8. Check Paste to One Track if you want all material imported into the current track.
9. Click OK.
Cakewalk imports the material and displays it in the Track view.

Importing audio / MIDI files from the Clips pane
It is possible to import audio and MIDI files via the Clips pane context menu. Imported files are inserted at the Now time.

To import audio/MIDI files
1. In the Clips pane, right-click the track to which you want to import an audio or MIDI file.
The Clips pane context menu appears.
2. Do one of the following:

 Select Import Audio to import an audio file.
 Select Import MIDI to import a MIDI file.

Saving your work
Like most Windows programs, Cakewalk has a File > Save command and a File > Save As command to save your work. Normally,
you save your projects in the standard project file format, with a file extension of .cwp. This file contains all your MIDI data and all
your project settings. Any digital audio that is part of your project is stored in a separate file, as described in “System configuration”
on page 1356. The File > Save Copy As command is similar to the File > Save As command, but lets you save a copy of the
current project under a different file name without closing the original project.
Cakewalk also lets you save files in several other formats, as described in the table:
File type

Format

Explanation

Standard MIDI

.mid

Used to transfer MIDI-only projects to other software products that support Standard MIDI files.

Bundle

.cwb

A single file that includes all the material in your project: MIDI data, project settings, and audio data. This
format is used for projects that contain digital audio, when you want to back up your work or transfer a
project to a different computer. See “Backing up projects with digital audio” on page 1352 for more
information.
Note: Bundle files do not save video data.

Template

.cwt

A file that is used as a pattern to create another. Templates make it easy to create and configure new
projects. See “Templates and key bindings” on page 1257 for more information.

If you have made changes to a project and then attempt to close the project, either by closing the Track view or by choosing File >
Close, Cakewalk asks if you want to save the changes you have made. This prevents you from accidentally losing your work. You
can tell whether changes have been made to a project by looking for an asterisk (*) after the project name in the Cakewalk title bar.
Cakewalk has an Auto Save feature that periodically saves your work into a special backup file. You can request automatic backups
at fixed time intervals or every time a certain number of changes have been made to the file. When the limit is reached, the file is
saved automatically. If your original project is called MyProject.cwp, the Auto Save version is called Auto Save Version of
MyProject.cwp.
If there is a power failure or if you make a significant mistake, you can recover the last-saved version of your project by opening this
file. You should then save your project under a different name by using the File > Save As command.

To Save a project
1. Choose File > Save As to display the Save As dialog box.
2. Choose the type of file you want to save from the Save as Type list.
3. Enter a file name and click Save.
Cakewalk saves the file. You can also use File Versioning instead of using Save As. For more information, see “To use File
Versioning” on page 387.

To change the Auto Save settings
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - Advanced to access Auto Save settings.
2. To enable Auto Save, set the number of minutes and/or the number of changes between saves.
3. To disable Auto Save, set both values to zero.
4. Click OK.
From now on, your projects are saved automatically according to the settings you entered.

Using File Versioning
Cakewalk can be enabled to keep previously saved versions of your project in a temporary file. You can revert to any of these saved
versions or use the default of the most recently saved version.
When file versioning is enabled, Cakewalk retains a list of previously saved project files in your project folder. The most recent
version retains the original name of the project. Previously saved versions are saved with a time stamp following the original project
name in order of most recently saved.

To use File Versioning
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - Advanced to access File Versioning settings.
2. Select the Enable Versioning of Project (.CWP) Files check box.
3. Use the spinner to select the number of versions of your project you would like Cakewalk to keep.
Note: If you exceed the maximum number of saved file versions selected in Step 3, the oldest version is discarded.

To revert to a previously saved file
1. Choose File > Revert.
A dialog box appears containing a list of dates and file sizes for all previously saved versions of the current project.
2. Select the file version you want to work on.
3. Click OK.
Note: If the current project is unsaved at the time you choose File > Revert, you will be prompted with a warning that reverting
the project will cause all unsaved changes to be lost. When the reverted project is loaded, the timestamp is stripped off, and
the reverted project assumes the project’s original name.

Tempo

Figure 144. Tempo track.

Your project can incorporate all kinds of tempo changes, including instant changes from one tempo to another, gradual increases
(accelerandos) or decreases (ritardandos), and almost any other type of change you can imagine.
A recording can sometimes sound mechanical if the project has a single static tempo. The tempo in a natural human performances
tends to drift slightly, which can produce more musical and interesting results.
You can add tempo changes to your project in the following ways:

 By drawing tempo changes graphically in the Tempo track. For details, see “Using the Tempo track” on page 402.
 Inserting tempo changes in the Tempo Inspector. For details, see “Using the Tempo Inspector” on page 413.
 Setting the project’s initial tempo by clicking the tempo display in the Control Bar’s Transport module. For details, see “Using the
Transport module” on page 415.

 Using the Project > Insert Tempo Change and Project > Insert Series of Tempos commands. For details, see “Using the
Tempo commands” on page 416.

 By extracting tempo information from audio clips. For details, see “Setting the project tempo from an audio recording” on page
419.

 By tapping along with the recording. For details, see “Setting the project tempo from freely recorded MIDI or audio” on page 421.
 By aligning measure and beat boundaries manually. For details, see “Aligning measure/beat boundaries manually” on page 423.
The Process > Fit to Time and Process > Fit Improvisation commands can also be used to introduce tempo changes. For more
information, see “Stretching and shrinking events” on page 866 and “Fit Improvisation” on page 876.

Note: Tempo changes have no effect if the clock source is set to MIDI Sync, because Cakewalk follows the external tempo. For
more information, see “Synchronizing your gear” on page 1335.

How tempo changes affect audio clips
When you change the tempo of a project that contains audio, Cakewalk allows you to automatically stretch or shrink audio clips to
follow the changed tempo. Otherwise, the MIDI tracks will speed up or slow down while the audio tracks will play at the same speed.
When you change the tempo of your project, audio clips that have stretching enabled change tempo along with the project, while
those that do not have stretching enabled do not. Audio clips that do not have stretching enabled change in size when moved to a
part of your project that has a different tempo.
In some situations you may not want to adjust the speed of your audio:

 If your project contains background music and a voice-over, you might want to change the tempo of the background music without
altering the voice-over.

 If you’re trying to modify the speed of some MIDI tracks to match a sampled drum groove, you want to leave the audio
unchanged.
An audio clip’s Time Base property determines what happens to the clip’s start time when you change the project tempo. You
specify the time base in the Clip Properties Inspector’s Properties section (see “Properties Inspector - Clip Properties” on page 708
and “Properties section” on page 709). The two Time Base options are as follows:

 Musical (M:B:T). If the clip is set to the Musical time base, the clip’s M:B:T position stays constant, and its Absolute (SMPTE)
position shifts.

 Absolute (SMPTE). If the clip is set to the Absolute (SMPTE) time base, its Absolute position stays constant, and its M:B:T
position shifts.
Note: The length of a clip may also change when you change the tempo—audio clips maintain their absolute (SMPTE) length,
while a MIDI clip will follow the value in the Time Base field.

Syncing audio and the project tempo
If you record without a metronome or import an audio recording, the audio will most likely not align perfectly to the project’s tempo
(measure and beat grid). You can set the initial project tempo to match the recording as closely as possible, but the tempo will likely
drift over time due to human performance variations and imperfections.
There are two ways to sync the audio recording and project tempo:

 Conform the audio to the project tempo. With this solution you stretch the audio so it follows the project tempo. For details,
see “Configuring audio clips to follow tempo changes” on page 391.

 Conform the project tempo to the audio. With this solution you create a tempo map that matches the audio. The metronome
click will perfectly follow along with the audio. Use this solution if you want to retain the recorded human performance variations.
For details, see “Setting the project tempo from an audio recording” on page 419.

Tempo

Configuring audio clips to follow tempo changes
If you want audio clips to follow tempo changes, configure the clips to follow tempo changes before you change the project tempo.
An audio clip can use either AudioSnap or Groove Clip stretching to follow tempo changes:
Method 1 (AudioSnap):
1. Select the audio clip(s) that you want to follow the project tempo.
2. Press ALT+A to open the AudioSnap palette.
3. Click the Clip Follows Project Tempo button

on the AudioSnap palette.

The clip(s) displays the Auto Stretch icon
, and is synchronized to the project’s tempo map (including future tempo changes).
The drop-down list lets you specify at which resolution the clip should follow tempo changes. The options are as follows:

 Beats
 Measures
 Clip (default)
 Auto Stretch
Note: The Clips follow project tempo command only works on clips that are configured to use musical time (the Time Base
property is set to Musical in the Clip Properties Inspector).

Note: If the audio clip does not play back at the expected tempo, the clip might not have an accurate internal tempo map. For
details about editing a clip’s tempo map, see “Editing a clip’s tempo map” on page 771.
Figure 145. AudioSnap palette

Tempo

391

Alternatively, you can enable Follow Project Tempo in the Clip Properties Inspector:
1. Select the audio clip(s) that you want to follow the project tempo.
2. In the Clip Properties Inspector’s AudioSnap section, select Enable, then select Follow Project Tempo.
3. Under Follow Options, specify at which resolution the clip should follow tempo changes:

 Beats
 Measures
 Clip (default)
 Auto Stretch
For details, see “Synchronizing audio and the project tempo” on page 769 and “Changing a project’s tempo” on page 773.
Figure 146. Clip Properties Inspector.

For more information about AudioSnap, see “AudioSnap” on page 751.
Method 2 (Groove Clip):
1. Select the audio clip(s) that you want to follow the project tempo.
2. In the Clip Properties Inspector’s Groove Clip section, select Stretch to Tempo.
The audio clips stretch or shrink to fit the project’s tempo. Cakewalk uses the Beats in Clip and Original Tempo parameters to
make the change.
Audio clips that do not have Stretch to Tempo enabled change in size when moved to a part of your project that has a different
tempo.
For details, see “Properties Inspector - Clip Properties” on page 708 and “Groove Clip section” on page 710.
Figure 147. Clip Properties Inspector.

How tempo changes affect automation
A track’s automation Time Base property (see “Automation time base” on page 1212) determines what happens to automation
envelopes when you change the project tempo. Automation can be locked to absolute time or musical time. You specify the time
base in the Track Properties Inspector’s Automation section (see “Properties Inspector - Track Properties” on page 713 and
“Automation section” on page 716). The two Time Base options are as follows:

 Musical (M:B:T). If the track is set to the Musical time base, the automation’s M:B:T position stays constant, and its absolute
position shifts. Automation nodes move to match the changes in tempo.

 Absolute (SMPTE). If the track is set to the Absolute time base, its absolute position stays constant, and its M:B:T position
shifts. The track’s automation is unaffected by changes in tempo, and existing automation will no longer be aligned with the audio
after a tempo change.
In general, it when applying tempo changes to a project that contains MIDI tracks and stretch-enabled audio clips, it is recommended
to set the automation Time Base to Musical.

Note: If an audio clip’s Time Base is set to Absolute, the clip’s length is unaffected by changes in tempo. As a result, existing
automation envelopes will no longer be aligned with the audio if the track’s automation Time Base is set to Musical.

Tempo track
Figure 148. Tempo track.

The Tempo track provides a graphic overview of the project tempo. It allows you to create and edit tempo changes within a project.
Every project has a tempo, which is expressed in beats per minute (BPM). You can set the tempo in the Transport module, Tempo
track, or Tempo inspector. A project can have a single static tempo, or a tempo map that changes over time.
A tempo map is simply the complete set of all tempo changes in a project. These changes are displayed as an envelope in the
Tempo track, and as a list in the Tempo Inspector (see “Tempo Inspector” on page 398).
In the Tempo track, tempo changes are represented by envelope shapes. You edit the project’s tempo map the same way you edit
automation envelopes (see “Creating and editing automation envelopes” on page 1222). If a project has a single fixed tempo, the
Tempo track shows a straight horizontal line. You create tempo changes by adding envelope nodes and editing their values. You can
expand the Tempo track to give yourself more room to work, and adjust the range of values for the Tempo track.

Showing the Tempo track
The Tempo track resides between the Clips pane and time ruler.
To show the Tempo track, do one of the following:

 Click the Track view View menu and select Tempo Track Show/Hide
 Press ALT+T
 Select Views > Tempo or press ALT+SHIFT+5 (this also opens the Tempo Inspector)

Tip: You can show/hide the Tempo track with the assignable Show/Hide Tempo Track global key binding. For details, see “Key
bindings” on page 1261.
Cakewalk also includes a workspace named Tempo that configures the layout for tempo editing. For details, see “Workspaces” on
page 745.

Changing tempos
Cakewalk provides various ways to change the project tempo, including the Tempo track, Tempo Inspector, Control Bar Transport
module, and various menu commands.
The most suitable method depends on the desired outcome. Although there may be multiple ways to achieve the same or similar
result, below are some suggestions.

 If you only want to set a singe fixed tempo for the duration of the project, use the Control Bar Transport module. For details, see
“Using the Transport module” on page 415.

 If you want to set multiple tempo changes or draw tempo changes graphically, use the Tempo track. For details, see “Using the
Tempo track” on page 402.

 If you don’t know the exact tempo BPM value and would like to tap the tempo, see “Setting the project tempo by tapping” on page
410.

 If you want to extract the tempo from an audio recording, see “Setting the project tempo from an audio recording” on page 419.
 If you want to extract the tempo from a freely recorded MIDI performance, see “Setting the project tempo from freely recorded
MIDI or audio” on page 421.

 If you want to stretch audio to conform to the project tempo, see “Configuring audio clips to follow tempo changes” on page 391.
 If you want to manually align each measure or beat boundary, see “Aligning measure/beat boundaries manually” on page 423.
 If you want the selection to fit a specific time duration, see “To stretch or shrink to a specific length” on page 867.
 If you want to quickly navigate to tempo changes, use the Tempo Inspector. For details, see “Tempo Inspector” on page 398.
 To remove all tempo changes, see “Resetting the entire tempo map” on page 411.

Using the Tempo track
Figure 151. Tempo track.

In the Tempo track, tempo changes appear as envelope nodes. Use the global tools to edit the tempo envelope. You create tempo
changes by adding envelope nodes, then editing their values. You can draw, move, cut, copy, and paste tempo changes, create
tempo curves, and edit tempo points in other ways.
You edit the project’s tempo map the same way you edit automation envelopes. For information on general automation envelope
operations, see “Creating and editing automation envelopes” on page 1222.
If you make a mistake using any of these tools, you can use Edit > Undo to correct the error.
The Control Bar contains several tools (see “Tools” on page 565) you can use to add or modify tempo changes:
Tool

Name

What it’s for

Smart

General editing (see “Using the Smart tool on automation” on page 582)

Select

Adjusting the shape of a tempo change
By default, tempo changes are inserted as envelope “jump” shapes, which appear as a straight dotted envelope. Jump shapes
produce an instant ninety degree jump where the envelope reaches the next tempo change.
You can also create a smooth continuous transition, or curve, between two different tempo values.
To change the tempo curve type, move the cursor over the segment of the envelope that lies between the two nodes until the Pencil
cursor appears, then right-click the envelope and choose one of the following shapes on the pop-up menu:

 Jump. This choice causes the envelope to make a ninety degree jump where the envelope reaches the second node. The
tempo value continues until the next tempo change. Cakewalk displays jumps with a dotted line, meaning that there is automation
data at the nodes where the dotted line begins and ends, but not where the line itself is.

 Linear. This choice draws a straight line between the two nodes.
 Fast Curve. This choice draws a curve between the two nodes that changes value rapidly at first, but more slowly toward the
end of the curve.

 Slow Curve. This choice draws a curve between the two nodes that changes value slowly at first, but more rapidly toward the
end of the curve.

You can also change the shape by clicking the rightmost column in the Tempo Inspector (see “Modifying tempo properties in the
Tempo Inspector” on page 413).

Tip: You can also change an envelope segment’s shape with the Edit tool
. To do so, select the envelope segment you want to
change, then hold down the CTRL key and drag the selected envelope segment up/down.
To create a ramp, insert a new tempo node and drag the node above or below its neighboring envelope node.

Tempo
Changing tempos

Raising/lowering the tempo envelope (shelving)
You can offset the tempo map, and thereby speed up or slow down the tempo, without losing the relationships between tempo
changes. This is also referred to as “shelving” the envelope. You can raise/lower the entire tempo envelope, or only the selected time
range.
To raise/lower the tempo envelope:
1. Drag in the Tempo track or time ruler to select the duration of the envelope that you want to raise/lower. To adjust the entire
envelope, clear the selection.
2. Do one of the following:

 With the Smart tool
like this

, position the pointer within the selection near the top of the Tempo track until the mouse pointer looks

, then drag up/down.

 With the Move tool

, position the pointer within the selection, then drag up/down.

Note: If the selected duration only spans a dotted envelope (Jump shape), you cannot position the pointer within selection to
drag up/down. However, you can position the pointer above any tempo envelope node until the mouse pointer looks like this
, then drag up/down.
You can also quickly convert the selected dotted envelope range to a Linear shape. To do so, right-click the selected envelope region
and select Add Nodes at Selection.This creates envelope nodes at the selection boundaries, and converts the region to a Linear
shape.
To offset the entire tempo map numerically, right-click in the Tempo track and select Offset Tempo Map, then specify a value to
apply to all existing tempo changes. For details, see “Offsetting the tempo map” on page 418.

Setting the project tempo by tapping
In a new song, the tempo may not be defined yet. If you don’t know the exact BPM value for your project, you can manually set the
project tempo by tapping the mouse button.
To use tap tempo:
1. Position the Now Time where you want to insert the tempo change.
2. Click the TAP button

in the Tempo track repeatedly to tap out a tempo.

Cakewalk averages the last 16 taps (weighted in favor of the last 4) to determine the correct tempo. The computed BPM value
appears in the BPM textbox.
3. Click the Insert Tempo Change

button in the Tempo track.

The project tempo is set to the tapped tempo.

 Right-click the tempo change and select Delete
 Press the DELETE key
 Select Edit > Delete
Cakewalk deletes the selected tempo change. You cannot delete the first tempo in the list.

Tip: You can select multiple tempo changes, then delete them simultaneously.
To select discontiguous tempo changes, hold down the CTRL key and click the tempo changes you want to select/deselect.
To select a range of adjacent tempo changes, click the first tempo change you want to select, then hold down the SHIFT key and click
the last tempo change you want to select.

Setting the project tempo from an audio recording
You can extract a tempo map from an audio recording as long as the audio contains discernible beats or rhythms, even if the audio
was not recorded to a metronome of contains tempo drift. By adapting the project tempo to match the recorded audio, you retain the
imperfections and human performance variations in the recorded audio.
Cakewalk uses Melodyne to extract tempo information from recorded audio. Melodyne features accurate tempo detection, and
Cakewalk’s ARA integration allows you to easily synchronize a project’s tempo map to the tempo of any Melodyne Region FX clip or
regular audio clip.

Method 1 (Melodyne)
To add the tempo from an audio clip to the project’s tempo map:
1. Do one of the following:

 Drag the audio clip to Cakewalk’s Tempo track or Time Ruler.

Note: In addition to dragging a Melodyne Region FX clip to the Time Ruler, you can also drag any audio clip to the Time Ruler
and Cakewalk will extract the tempo information using Melodyne and ARA and set the global tempo map for that region. It is not
necessary to first convert the audio clip to a Melodyne Region FX clip, but this approach will not allow you to edit the tempo in
Melodyne before extracting the tempo. The only exclusions are Groove clips and REX files, since they already follow Cakewalk’s
tempo. If a clip has Lock Position enabled, hold down the CTRL key in order to drag it to the Time Ruler.

 [Melodyne Region FX clip only] Click the Tempo Options button in Melodyne, then select Confirm as File Tempo.

2. In the Select Algorithm dialog box, select the algorithm that best suits the audio material, then click OK.
The clip’s tempo map is added to Cakewalk’s tempo map.

Tempo
Changing tempos

419

Method 2 (AudioSnap)
You can also sync the project tempo to an audio clip with the following method:
1. Select the audio clip(s) that has the desired tempo map.
2. Press ALT+A to open the AudioSnap palette.
3. Click the Set Project Tempo From Clip button

on the AudioSnap palette.

The clip tempo map is copied to the project tempo map so the tempo maps are identical. This allows the project’s measure
boundaries to align with the audio clip(s).
Note 1: The Set Project Tempo From Clip drop-down list lets you specify at which resolution the clip’s tempo map should be
copied to the project tempo. The options are as follows:
• Beats
• Measures (default)
• Clip

Note 2: If multiple audio clips have their Clip Timebase property set to Musical, changing the project tempo will affect the
relative positions of the audio clips. When using the Set Project Tempo from Clip command, Cakewalk will offer to convert
the timebase to Absolute.

Setting the project tempo from freely recorded MIDI or audio
You can record a performance without the metronome and have Cakewalk adapt the project tempo to match the tempo of the
recording.
The Process > Fit Improvisation command lets you take a recording and create a tempo map (with measure and beat boundaries)
that fits what you played. Your performance is not changed in any way, even though MIDI note start times and durations are adjusted
to fit the new tempo map. This is important if you later want to use any of Cakewalk’s editing features that depend on a proper tempo
map for best results, such as Snap to Grid and Quantize.
In order to create a tempo map, you must first record a MIDI reference track and tap in the beat (one note per beat). To do so:
1. Select Insert > MIDI Track to insert a new blank MIDI track, then arm it for recording.
2. Rewind to the start of the project, and start recording.

 Use a MIDI controller to tap the tempo along to the beat of the freely recorded music.
 IMPORTANT: You must record only a single MIDI note on each beat boundary. The reference track must contain one event for
every single beat, with no extra beats or missing beats. Missing or extra MIDI events will cause the tempo matching to fail. The
first beat of the reference track should be at 1:01:000.

 The better the quality of your reference track, the better job the Fit Improvisation command can do. You want each of your
reference track events to be as close as possible to the beat of the music.
3. Stop recording and play back the recorded MIDI notes together with the original recording to check if the timing is correct. Make
any necessary corrections. You can use any editing command to adjust the reference track.
4. The reference track must only contain a single MIDI clip. If there are multiple clips, combine all clips in the reference track into a
single clip using the Track view Clips > Bounce to Clip(s) command.
5. Select the reference MIDI clip, then select Process > Fit Improvisation.
Cakewalk adds tempo changes as necessary to fit the tempo grid to the reference track. When you’re done, you should mute the
reference track, since the reference track events are not rescaled.
Note: If the resulting tempo grid exceeds 250 beats per minute, you will see an error message. If this happens, you can shorten
the start times of each event using the Process > Length command, decrease the tempo to compensate for the change, and
then try again.

Note: If you want, you can use other types of events as markers on the reference track, such as a sustain pedal. Remember,
however, that MIDI sustain pedals generate one event when the pedal is pressed and another when it is released. So if you want
to use the sustain pedal for the reference track, keep this in mind. Click down, up, down, up, for one, two, three, four.
Some keyboards transmit aftertouch events when you record your reference track. These extra events will prevent Process >
Fit Improvisation from working properly. Therefore, you should delete these events before using this command, or filter them
out when recording the reference track (using Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Playback and Recording).
You can also use the Project > Set/Measure Beat At Now command to align a freely played MIDI performance with the Time Ruler.
For details, see “Aligning measure/beat boundaries manually” on page 423.

Aligning measure/beat boundaries manually
If you have recorded a MIDI track without a metronome, you may want to align the project’s tempo map with the MIDI performance.
The Set/Measure Beat At Now command allows you to create new bar lines to fit your project. This command does not stretch
audio. It works by adjusting tempo so that measure lines line up with audio transients or MIDI data. The tempo will ramp up/down
from the previous tempo change in order to arrive at the required tempo.
To use the Set Measure/Beat At Now command, you need to be able to identify where you want to put the downbeats of each
measure, and possibly where you want to place some other beats of the measure, if the tempo varies a lot.
1. Display the MIDI clip that you want the measure/beats to align with in the Inline Piano Roll view: click the MIDI track’s Edit Filter
control and choose Notes. Zoom in enough to see the MIDI data clearly (you can also use the regular Piano Roll view).
Tip: To make it easier to visually align note events with the Time Ruler, drag the MIDI track to the top position so it appears right below
the Time Ruler.

2. If you want other MIDI clips that exist in the project to retain their current M:B:T positions, select the clips, right-click one of them,
and choose Clip Lock > Lock Position from the pop-up menu.
3. Turn off the Snap to Grid button
, and use the Select tool
to click the MIDI clip at the place where you want to set a
measure or beat. The Now Time cursor moves to the place you clicked:

A
A. Now Time cursor

4. Choose Project > Set Measure/Beat at Now to open the Measure Beat/Meter dialog box.

Tempo
Changing tempos

423

5. Enter the desired measure and beat values, and click OK.
Note: Cakewalk attempts to guess the correct measure/beat, so you usually can just click OK to accept the default values.

6. Move the Now Time to the next desired beat (click the start of the next note).
Tip: Press TAB to jump to the next note, or SHIFT+TAB to jump to the previous note.

7. Choose Project > Set Measure/Beat at Now to open the Measure Beat/Meter dialog box, enter the desired values, and click
OK.
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 until the Time Ruler is correctly aligned.
After you align the Time Ruler to your clip, you can smooth out the tempo changes in the Tempo view, and your clip will retain its
M:B:T position.

Backwards compatibility
When loading legacy Cakewalk and SONAR projects, the tempo map is automatically converted to a tempo envelope. The following
Cakewalk.ini variables affect how tempo envelope shapes are preserved when opening Cakewalk 2021.04 (and later) projects in
earlier versions.

Variable

Type

TempoMapDecimationResolution=<0 - Integer
3>

Default value

What it does

1 (240 ticks / 16th
note)

Setting the value to 2 or 3 will increase the number of
decimation points, making the tempo changes more
accurate, but will slow down calculations when drawing
envelopes.
The values are as follows:
1 = 240 ticks (16th Note)
2 = 120 ticks (32nd Note)
3 = 60 ticks (64th Note)
4 = 30 ticks (128th Note)
5 = 15 ticks (256th Note)
6 = 12 ticks (320th Note)
7 = 6 ticks (640th Note)
8 = 3 ticks (1280th Note)

TempoImportDecimationResolution
=<0 - 3>

Integer

1 (240 ticks / 16th
note)

This variable should be left at 1 in most cases in order to pick
up most shapes.
The values are as follows:
1 = 240 ticks (16th Note)
2 = 120 ticks (32nd Note)
3 = 60 ticks (64th Note)
4 = 30 ticks (128th Note)
5 = 15 ticks (256th Note)
6 = 12 ticks (320th Note)
7 = 6 ticks (640th Note)
8 = 3 ticks (1280th Note)

TempoImportErrorThreshold=<0 -

Integer

10

This variable controls how close the tempo entries have to
match points on a candidate curve before this curve is
chosen. The best fit curve will always be chosen first, but this
threshold determines whether to go with that curve or
continue with discrete points.
Valid entries are 0 to 250 (0.00 to 0.25). The default is 10,
which equates to a difference of 0.01 of four point
differences added together.
A value of 0 effectively means import everything as discrete
jump values.

BandLab library import/export

Cakewalk provides complete integration with your BandLab library, with support for downloads and uploads, tracking revision state,
and setting song properties directly from within Cakewalk. You can export Cakewalk projects to BandLab as well as download
projects from your BandLab library and open them in Cakewalk.
BandLab integration allows you to publish Cakewalk stems and mixes to the BandLab cloud, continue working on your songs using
BandLab on mobile (iOS and Android) or web, and import your changes back to Cakewalk. This workflow presents many
possibilities, including:

 Publish Cakewalk projects, stems and mixes to your BandLab library, and easily share audio on mobile and web
 Quickly open BandLab projects in Cakewalk
 Collaborate easily by sharing audio tracks via the BandLab cloud
 Bring projects started on mobile into Cakewalk for VST effects and advanced editing
 Fly in vocals or other parts for a Cakewalk project from iOS and Android
 Curate your music as playlists that you can play anywhere from your mobile device
 Quickly audition multiple mixes on different platforms (fo example, check the mix in your car by connecting via Bluetooth to your
car stereo)

BandLab library import/export

427

 Publish your Cakewalk projects to BandLab, then embed the song on the Cakewalk User-submitted Songs forum at https://
discuss.cakewalk.com/index.php?/forum/30-songs (this is much more powerful than posting a stereo mix to your song, because if
you additionally provide stems others can offer more constructive advice on your mixes)
For more information about the free BandLab social music service, visit www.BandLab.com.

Publishing to your BandLab library
When publishing to BandLab, a project can be uploaded as a new project, or as a revision of the current BandLab project (see “What
is a revision?” on page 428).
To publish the current project to your BandLab library, select File > Publish to BandLab or choose Export > BandLab from the
Export Control Bar module.
Use the Upload Settings options to select the combination of project assets you wish to upload to the BandLab project. Tracks and
buses are mixed down prior to uploading to BandLab.
For details, see “Publishing to BandLab” on page 429.

Importing from your BandLab library
To open a BandLab project, select File > Browse BandLab Projects. You may open as a new Cakewalk project or import into an
existing project. Note that revisions are only tracked if you open as a new Cakewalk project. Use the Download Settings options to
select the types of assets from the BandLab project you wish to download and open.
For details, see “Importing from BandLab” on page 431.

Important: Cakewalk is no longer compatible with projects downloaded via BandLab Assistant. As of version 2021.04, BandLab
Assistant should no longer be used for BandLab project integration.

What is a revision?
A Revision is a revised edit of your project with a unique date/timestamp. A new revision is created every time you make a new
BandLab project or save an edit of your existing BandLab project.
Revisions ensure that nothing is overwritten. All revisions are saved, and you can go back to an older version of your project at any
time.
You can upload as a revision to an existing project. Here are two ways to do it:

 Upload a new project from Cakewalk. After you have published as a new project, any subsequent updates to the SAME
project will upload as revisions to the BandLab project. The Cakewalk project will store a reference to the uploaded BandLab
project and tracks changes from that point on. For details, see “Publishing the current project to your BandLab library” on page
429.

 Download a project created on BandLab to create a NEW Cakewalk project. After you load a BandLab project to create a
new Cakewalk project, any changes to this project will upload as revisions to the ORIGINAL BandLab project. The Cakewalk
project stores a reference to the BandLab project and tracks changes from that point on. For details, see “Opening or importing a
project from your BandLab library” on page 431.
Cakewalk projects opened from BandLab songs automatically inherit the song revision they were derived from. Subsequent uploads
of the project by default are automatically linked to the last song revision.
Projects that originate from Cakewalk also follow the same rules. You may also create fresh BandLab songs from a revision by
selecting Upload as New Project in the Upload Project dialog box (File > Publish to BandLab).

Collaborate with others
You can invite other people to collaborate on a project via the BandLab cloud. For details, see “Inviting collaborators” on page 435.

Switching BandLab user accounts
If you have multiple BandLab user accounts and would like to sign in as a different user, select Help > Sign Out from BandLab,
then select Help > Sign In to BandLab to sign in with a different account.

BandLab library import/export

Publishing to BandLab
Max duration and track limit
When publishing to BandLab, you can export a maximum duration of 15 minutes and up to 16 tracks or buses.
If the project or selection exceeds these limits, adjust the selection before publishing to BandLab.

Note: An instrument track includes two tracks when uploading both audio and MIDI tracks.

Public vs private projects
A BandLab project can be either public or private. When a project is marked as Public, anyone will be able to listen, comment and
share the project. Mark a project as Public when you want to share your song with the BandLab community.
By default, all content is set to “Private”, meaning that only you and any invited collaborators can access it, make adaptations of it
and use it. When Public is enabled, other users can view your content or play it on BandLab by streaming, but they will not be able
to download, adapt, synchronize or use that content.

Publishing the current project to your BandLab library
After you have recorded and arranged your tracks, you can publish the project to your BandLab library.
To publish the current project:
1. Do one of the following:

 Go to File > Publish to BandLab to open the Upload Project dialog box.
 In the Control Bar’s Export module, select either Project or Selection to specify if you want to publish the entire project, or
only selected clips and tracks, then click the Export button and select BandLab to open the Upload Project dialog box.
Note: If you want to publish individual tracks or buses, and the project contains more than 16 tracks or buses, you must select
Selection and manually select the tracks or buses you want to export.

2. In the Upload Project dialog box, you can modify the following project settings:

 Project Name. Specify the name of the project as you want it to appear in BandLab. By default, the name is inherited from
the Cakewalk project name.

 Description. Enter a brief description for the project/revision (up to 250 characters).
 Upload Settings. Select the project assets you want to upload:
• Audio Tracks. Publish individual audio tracks and Instrument track audio, up to a maximum of 16 tracks. All clips in a track
are mixed down to a single region.
• MIDI Tracks. Publish individual MIDI and Instrument tracks. If Audio Tracks and MIDI Tracks are both selected,
instrument track MIDI and audio are both uploaded, and the MIDI instrument track is muted in BandLab.
• Empty Tracks. Upload empty tracks. The project must contain at least one non-empty track.

BandLab library import/export
Publishing to BandLab

429

• Buses.

Publish stereo bus outputs, up to a maximum of 16 buses (surround buses will downmix to stereo).

Note: If your project contains more than 16 buses, you must manually select the buses you want to export, and also select the
audio tracks that feed the buses. For details, see “Bus selection” on page 984 and “Select tracks/buses that are assigned to a
specific bus” on page 985.
• Project Mixdown. Publish the entire mix as a single track. If you publish both individual tracks and a project mixdown, the
project mixdown will be muted in order to prevent doubled audio.

 Upload as new project. [Only available if the current project has already been published] Instead of uploading as a revision
of the current project, upload as a new project. Different edited versions of BandLab songs are linked together by a revision
control system. For details, see “What is a revision?” on page 428.

Arranging and editing

The Track view makes it easy to arrange and mix your projects from a single view. From one location, you can select, copy, move,
mix, and rearrange the parts of your project, using menu commands or drag-and-drop tools.
You can add real-time audio and MIDI effects from the FX Rack and buses.
Arranger tracks allows you to create a color coded overview of the song structure, then edit sections of the entire project as one unit
instead of moving individual clips. You can also create different arrangements in a non-destructive and non-linear manner.
Markers provide easy-to-use reference points and labels for the different parts of your project, and the snap grid makes it easy to
align your clips to the desired time points.
Slip-editing allows you to non-destructively change the start and/or end time of a clip, just by dragging its borders.
With Groove clips, you can easily create repetitions of your clips using your mouse.
Both the Track view and Console view have a full set of record and playback meters, which you can configure in several ways.
Cakewalk also has a variety of tools and commands for changing the tempo of your project.
Composite tracks allow you to keep all your takes in one track if you want, and selectively mute and solo the various clips in the
track. Track folders let you edit multiple tracks at once and conserve screen space.

Arranger tracks
Overview
An Arranger track is an arrangement tool that provides several workflow benefits:

 Easily rearrange sections of the entire project as one unit instead of moving individual clips. For example, instantly swap the
positions of the first and second chorus for all tracks, or copy the first verse in order to double its duration (see “Arranger track
drag operations” on page 463).

 Experiment with different song structures in a non-destructive and non-linear manner. For example, does your song work best in
AABA, ABAB, or ABAC song form? Define time range sections and sequence them in any order without destructively moving any
clip data. You can even save multiple arrangements within each project (see “Creating arrangements” on page 467), and create
Arranger templates that can be used in any project (see “Arranger templates” on page 472).

 Create a color coded overview of the song structure, and use the Arranger Inspector to quickly navigate around the project and
jump to song sections (see “Navigating by Arranger sections” on page 470).

 Create arbitrary song sections anywhere on the project timeline, then later string them together for seamless playback (see
“Defining sections of your song” on page 453 and “Creating arrangements” on page 467).

 Sections provide an additional way to perform time based selections and edits of the project.
 Create an unlimited number of arrangements per project, which can all be exported simultaneously (see “Exporting
arrangements” on page 471).
Arranger functionality is distributed across two views:

 Arranger track (see “Arranger tracks” on page 441)
 Arranger Inspector (see “Arranger Inspector” on page 448)

A. Arranger Inspector B. Arranger track(s)/timeline C. Sections D. Current arrangement

An arrangement is comprised of Sections, each spanning a unique time range. Other section properties include name and color, to
clearly delineate regions of time and track content by musical function.

Important: By default, clicking an Arranger section also selects underlying track events. Clicking again deselects track events,
while retaining selection of the section. This behavior allows you to easily determine whether or not track events are included in
section edit operations. Note that the selection highlight in the Clips pane indicates selected track events.
To disable automatic selection of track events when selecting sections, right-click in the Arranger track timeline and disable Select
Events with Sections.

Tip: You can prevent data on individual tracks from being selected when you select Arranger sections. For details, see “Excluding
tracks from following arrangements” on page 466.

Basic workflow
1. Create and edit sections either within the Arranger Inspector or Arranger track timeline (see “Defining sections of your song” on
page 453).
2. Move, add, delete, trim and reorder sections (see “Editing sections” on page 460).
3. [Optional] Create arrangements (see “Creating arrangements” on page 467):
a) Create alternate orders of sections, called arrangements, without affecting track events.
b) Arrangement sections can be edited and previewed independently of project sections.
c) An arrangement can subsequently be rendered to the project timeline and/or exported (see “Exporting arrangements” on
page 471).

Arranger tracks
A project can contain multiple Arranger tracks, with each track containing its own set of sections.Multiple Arranger tracks provides
many benefits, including:

 Simultaneously declare multiple sections intersecting within a given range of time.
 Define and organize sub-sections within a larger section. For example, if you have a live recording of multiple songs, you can use
one Arranger track to mark out each song, and another to mark out the verses and choruses within each song.

 Use multiple sections for generic annotation within a project.

Arranger track time base
The time base format for each Arranger track can be set to either Musical or Absolute. The time base format determines what
happens to sections when you change the project tempo.
To toggle between musical and absolute time, click the icon to the left of the Arranger track name in the Track view:

 Musical

.

A section’s M:B:T position stays constant, and its absolute position shifts.

 Absolute

. A section’s absolute position stays constant, and its M:B:T position shifts. Absolute time is useful for scoring to
film/video. The Arranger track tooltip shows time as H:M:S:F and samples.

A. Musical time B. Absolute time

When committing an arrangement, the following rules apply:

 If all the sections came from absolute time Arranger tracks, the committed arrangement track will be absolute.
 If the sections came from musical Arranger tracks (or a mixture of musical/absolute), the committed arrangement track will be
musical.

Selection behaviors
 You can choose whether a time selection contains sections from only the active Arranger track, or from all Arranger tracks. This is
done from the Track view Options menu:

 Select Sections with Time Ruler (Active Arranger Track). Making a time selection in the time ruler will also select any
overlapping Arranger sections in the active Arranger track.

 Select Sections with Time Ruler (All Arranger Tracks). Making a time selection in the time ruler will also select any
overlapping Arranger sections in all Arranger tracks.

 Ripple Edit All affects sections in all Arranger tracks.

Sections
Sections are the building blocks that make up the song. Each section defines a time range in the project, such as Intro, Verse,
Chorus, etc. An arrangement is an ordered set of sections. You can sort the sections in any order to define the playback order. To do
so, drag the sections from the Sections area down to the Arrangements area.
The Sections area lists all the arranger sections defined in the project’s timeline, from which a custom arrangement can be built.
The order of the sections reflect the order in which they appear in the timeline.
The Sections list provides an additional way to edit time based selections of the project. Any operation performed in the Sections
list is immediately reflected in the project/timeline, and vice versa.
To copy all sections to the current arrangement, click the Add All Sections to Arrangement button
selected, only the selected sections will be copied.

. If one or more sections are

The Arrangements area allows you to sequence sections in a non-linear manner without destructively moving any clip data,
regardless of which order they appear in the project’s timeline.
The Sections list is a collection of project sections from which an arrangement can be built. To create an arrangement, drag sections
from the Sections list or from the Arranger track. Any section can appear multiple times within an arrangement (or not at all).
To move sections in the list, drag them up or down.
To play the current arrangement, click the Preview button
or press ALT+SPACEBAR (see “To preview an arrangement” on page
468). The Arrangements list shows the order in which the sections are played back, from top to bottom.
To (destructively) render the current arrangement to the project’s timeline, click the Commit Arrangement to Project button
(see “To commit an arrangement” on page 469).

Note: Operations performed in the Arrangements section have no effect on the linear project structure until you click the

Defining sections of your song
To use the Arranger track, you must first define time range sections such as Intro, Verse, Chorus, etc. Sections can be of any
duration, but it is common to start/end them at measure boundaries.

Tip: When drawing section in the Arranger timeline, enable Snap to Grid and set the snap resolution to Measure.

Section behaviors
 Sections are presented above the Clips pane, immediately below the time ruler.
 Sections cannot overlap, but do not have to be contiguous.
 Changing the position of a section changes the relative positions of track content within the section, with ripple effect.
 Section position can also be changed without modifying track events.
To add a section
If the Arranger track is not visible, click the Track view View menu and select Arranger Track Show/Hide, or press A.
If the Arranger Inspector is not visible, click the Show/Hide Arranger button

at the top of the Inspector pane.

New sections can be created by any of the following means:

 Draw a range within the Arranger track timeline (below the time ruler).
 Hold down the ALT key to overwrite any downstream sections you draw over.
 Hold down the SHIFT key to move over any downstream sections.
 Double-click a blank area in the Arranger track. The new section duration is inherited from the last clicked section.
 To insert a new section that spans the gap between two existing sections, hold down the ALT key and double-click the gap, or
right-click the gap and select Span Sections.

 To insert a section at the mouse position, right-click the blank area in the Arranger track timeline and point to Insert Section, then
select Here and select the desired section type.

 To insert a section at the Now Time, right-click the blank area in the Arranger track timeline and point to Insert Section, then
select At Now Time and select the desired section type.

 A new section appears at the Now Time position.
 If there is space between the Now Time and the next section, the new section will be equal to the size of the previous selected
section, or truncated to fit in the gap.

 If there is no space between the Now Time and the next section, the new section will be equal to the size of the previous
selected section, and downstream sections move to make room. Any selected track events also move.

 If the Now Time position overlaps an existing section, the new section is added at the end.
 Click the Add Section button

in the Arranger Inspector.

 The new section duration is inherited from the last clicked section, or defaults to 1 measure.
 If no sections are selected, the new section is added at the end.
 If at least one section is selected, the new section is added at the beginning of the selection, and downstream sections move
to make room. Any selected track events also move.

Tip: Right-click the Add Section button

 Click the Add Section at Now Time button

to insert a section of a specific type (see “Section types” on page 456).

in the Arranger track.

 Make a time selection, for example by selecting a range of track events, then right-click in the time ruler and select Create
Section from Selection. A new Arranger section is created with start/end times defined by the selection.

 You can convert existing text markers to sections. For details, see “Converting markers to sections and vice versa” on page 455.

Figure 171. Adding a section in the Arranger Inspector adds it in the Arranger track timeline as well.

By default, drawing a section or clicking the Add Section button
creates a new unassigned section, which can then be assigned
to a specific section type (see “To assign a section type to a section” on page 456). However, you can also directly insert a section of
a specific type. This can be done in the following ways:

 Right-click in the Arranger track and point to Insert Section, then select the desired section type from the submenu.
 Right-click the Add Section button

in the Arranger Inspector and select the section type from the pop-up menu.

 In the Media Browser, select the Arranger Templates content location preset, then open the Single sections folder and drag
the desired template to an Arranger track.

Converting markers to sections and vice versa
You can automatically create Arranger sections based on existing text markers (see “Creating and using markers” on page 515), and
vice versa.
To convert markers to sections, make a time selection in the time ruler that spans the text markers, then right-click in the time ruler
and select Create Sections from Markers.
The easiest way to use this is to use CTRL+A to select all before invoking this command. Sections are created, beginning at each
text marker location, and ending at the location of the next marker in the timeline. Note that if you have markers beyond the last clip,
you may have to extend your selection to encompass this marker.
The Create Markers from Sections command is similar, except it creates markers from sections. In both cases, any duplicates are
skipped.

Section types
Arranger sections can be assigned to an optional section type attribute, such as Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc. Cakewalk includes
many common section types, and you can create your own custom section type presets (see “To create a new section type preset”
on page 457).
Section types provide the following benefits:

 By tagging sections with type attributes, you can use Arranger templates (see “Arranger templates” on page 472) to instantly
create new arrangements from your existing sections (see “To create a new arrangement from an Arranger template” on page
474).

 Quickly assign consistent names and colors to sections that serve specific musical functions in a song.
 Directly insert new sections that automatically use appropriate names and colors.

To assign a section type to a section
Right-click a section in the Arranger track or Arranger Inspector, point to Section Type, and select the desired section type.
The section inherits the name and color from the section type preset.
When a section is assigned to a type, the type abbreviation is shown in the top right corner of the section. This serves as a visual
aide to help you identify which sections have been assigned to a type.

Note: If you have previously given the section a custom name, the original name is retained after assigning a section type. If
you want to use the default style name, clear the current section name via the Rename command. A blank name will
automatically use the stored style name. Should you want to use a blank section name, simply use a single space character as
the name.

Dealing with leading/trailing MIDI notes that overlap section boundaries
When dragging sections or committing arrangements, Cakewalk has logic for dealing with leading/trailing MIDI notes that overlap
section boundaries.
In the following example, section 2 is selected. The underlying MIDI clip contains note events that start slightly before section 2 and
end slightly after section 2. By default, selecting section 2 will ignore the portions of overlapping note events that fall outside the
section boundaries. Cakewalk now lets you optionally include the full duration of overlapping note events.

A
A. Notes that overlap section boundaries

Leading/trailing notes are often created in the following scenarios:

 The recorded performance is unquantized and notes appear slightly earlier than the section start.
 When using a sound with a slow attack, and the notes have to be played early to make up for the attack time.
 Leading notes as part of a lead-in phrase, or droned notes that overlap with the section boundaries.
You can specify the threshold that determines which overlapping note events are included when moving sections.
To do so, click the Track view MIDI menu and point to Arranger Section Event Overlap Threshold, then select one of the following
options:

 Off. Ignore overlapping notes.
 Note value (Whole – 1/256 Triplet). Only include notes that overhang by a duration equal to or less than the selected value.
 Any Overlap. Include notes that overhang by any duration.
When overlapping notes fall within the threshold set, those notes are included in the section move/copy and the clip start/end is
automatically resized (slip-edited) to accommodate the notes. The moved notes are also removed from the neighboring sections.
This requires Non-destructive Editing to be enabled, and works best with Split MIDI Note enabled.
The Arranger Section Event Overlap Threshold setting affects all arranger drag operations, delete, commit arrangement, and
Duplicate from the section context menu.

Excluding tracks from following arrangements
By default, clicking an Arranger section also selects underlying track events. Clicking again deselects track events, while retaining
selection of the section. This behavior allows you to easily determine whether or not track events are included in section edit
operations. Note that the selection highlight in the Clips pane indicates selected track events.
You can prevent data on individual tracks from being affected when you edit arranger sections. To do so, select Arranger Exclude
in the Track Properties Inspector (see “Properties Inspector - Track Properties” on page 713).

Tip: To exclude all track, press CTRL+A to select all tracks, then select Arranger Exclude in the Track Properties Inspector.

You can also lock individual clips to prevent them from being affected when editing sections. For details, see “Locking Clips” on page
504.

Creating arrangements
An arrangement describes the overall structure of the song.
Sections can be sequenced in any order to create arrangements, without affecting project data. The sections don’t have to live on
the project timeline in any specific location or order, because the arrangement determines in which order they are played back.
The Arranger Inspector allows you to create unlimited different arrangements of the current project. Each arrangement can contain
any combination of sections, in any order. All arrangements are saved within the project.
Arrangements are not tied to a specific Arranger track, and can contain sections from different Arranger tracks. In the Arranger
Inspector, the tooltip indicates a section's parent Arranger track.
If the Arranger Inspector is not visible, click the Show/Hide Arranger button

at the top of the Inspector pane.

To create a new arrangement
1. Click the Arrangements menu and select New.
2. Drag sections from the Sections list down to the Arrangements list. You can also drag sections directly from the Arranger track.
See also:
“To create a new arrangement from an Arranger template” on page 474

To create new arrangement based on an existing arrangement
You can quickly create a new arrangement by selecting sections in an existing arrangement. To do so, select the desired sections in
the Arranger Inspector’s Arrangements pane, then right-click in the Arrangements pane and select New Arrangement From
Selection.

To add a section to the current arrangement
Do one of the following:

 Drag the section(s) from the Sections area or from the Arranger track timeline down to the Arrangements area.
 In the Sections area, select the section(s) you want to add to the current arrangement, then click the Add Selected Sections to
Arrangement button

.

To move sections in the Arrangements list, drag them up or down.

To add all sections to the current arrangement
1. Make sure either no sections are selected, or all sections are selected.
2. Click the Add All Sections to Arrangement button

.

If one or more sections are selected, only the selected sections will be copied.

To remove a section from the current arrangement
Select the section in the Arrangements list and press the DELETE key.
Right-click the section in the Arrangements list and select Remove.
The Remove command removes the section from the arrangement, but does not delete it from the Sections list or from the
Arranger track timeline.

Tip: To remove all instances of a specific section from the current arrangement, click the section in the Arranger Inspector’s Sections
list. This selects all the instances of the section in the current arrangement. Next, right-click any of the selected instances of the section
in the Arrangements list and select Remove.

To remove all sections from the current arrangement
Right-click an empty area in the Arrangements list and select Remove All Arrangement Sections.
Only the sections themselves are removed. Track events associated with the sections are not affected.

Arranging and editing
Arranger tracks

To commit an arrangement
When you have configured an arrangement the way you like, and you are certain that you do not want to edit it any further, you can
convert it to a linear project.
To commit an arrangement to the project’s timeline, select the arrangement, then click the Commit Arrangement to Project button
.
The selected arrangement is converted into a linear project, updating track content and section display in the timeline accordingly.
If you would like to create linked clips when committing an arrangement, hold down the SHIFT key, then click the Commit
Arrangement to Project button

.

Caution: Rendering an arrangement may potentially remove events from the project, so only use Commit Arrangement to
Project when you no longer need to edit the arrangement. If in doubt, save a backup copy of the project before rendering the
arrangement.

Note: Some generative VST instruments (EZkeys, EZdrummer, Jamstix, etc.) have their own internal timeline. If you sequence
parts within the VSTi to play based on the original project timeline, the VSTi will play back using its internal timeline as a
reference, and will not be aware of your new song structure after committing an arrangement.
There are two ways to handle this:
• Don't use the plug-in's internal timeline to sequence parts
• Freeze the plug-in before rendering an arrangement

To insert an arrangement at the Now Time
You can insert a committed arrangement into the existing project at the Now Time. To do so, right-click the Commit Arrangement to
Project button

and select Insert Committed Arrangement.

Sections for the inserted arrangement are added to new Arranger track. Any other existing Arranger tracks, sections and
arrangements remain unaffected.
Any existing events after the Now Time will be shifted over to make room for the inserted arrangement.
As with the Commit Arrangement to Project command, holding down the SHIFT key while selecting the command will cause the
events under the arrangement sections to be copied as linked clips.

Arranger templates
Arranger templates are pre-defined song forms that store the order in which sections are arranged. You can think of an Arranger
template as a map of an entire song.
Arranger templates are global and can be used in several ways:

 Create a new Arranger track from a template. The template is applied to the Arranger track, which creates new sections. This
is useful when starting a new song and you want to quickly create all Arranger sections for a typical song form that you can fill in
with music.

 Insert sections in an existing Arranger track. Drag Arranger templates from the Media Browser and drop them in existing
Arranger tracks. Sections in the template are inserted into the target track.

 Create a new arrangement. If your project already contains existing sections, you can use Arranger templates to create new
arrangements from the existing sections. This allows you to preview your existing sections with different song forms. Sections that
exist in the template but not in the project can be optionally created at the end of the project in the active Arranger track.
Arranger templates store the following information:

 Section order
 Section types
 Section names
 Section durations
 Section colors
Cakewalk includes many common Arranger templates, and you can create your own custom templates that can be used in any
project. Arranger templates can be created from an existing Arranger track or from an existing arrangement.
Arranger templates can be found in the Media Browser under Arranger Templates.

To save an Arranger track as a template
1. In the Arranger track timeline or Arranger Inspector’s Section list, arrange sections in the desired order.
[Optional] To get the most benefit from Arranger templates, assign a section type to each section (see “To assign a section type
to a section” on page 456). This will allow templates to map their saved sections to existing sections.
2. Do one of the following:

 In the Arranger Inspector, click the Sections menu and select Save as Arranger Template.
 In the Track view, right-click the Arranger track name and select Save as Arranger Template.
Note: Gaps between sections are not saved in Arranger templates.

To save an arrangement as a template
1. In the Arranger Inspector’s Arrangements list, arrange sections in the desired order.
2. Click the Arrangements menu and select Save as Arranger Template.

To create a new Arranger track from a template
To create a new Arranger track from an Arranger template, do one of the following:

 In the Track view, right-click any Arranger track name and select New Arranger Track from Template.
 In the Media Browser, select the Arranger Templates content location preset, and do one of the following:
 Drag a template (.arr file) to the Arranger Inspector’s Sections area.
 Drag a template (.arr file) to the Track view Arranger track header area.
 Hold down the ALT key and double-click a template (.arr file).
Cakewalk creates a new Arranger track containing sections from the template.

Note: Only 8 Arranger tracks can be shown simultaneously. If 8 Arranger tracks are already visible, you must first hide at least
one track before you can create a new Arranger track.

Tip: The Arranger workspace is configured to show the Arranger Templates folder in the Media Browser. For details about using
Workspaces, see “Workspaces” on page 745.

Cakewalk will try to match the sections in the project with the types specified within the template, and create a new arrangement
from them.

Note: When creating a new arrangement from a template, Cakewalk attempts to automatically map sections that are stored in
the template to sections that already exist in the project. The mapping is based on section names and types.
If the template contains types that don't exist in the project, it will try to find a section with the same name as that type. If there is no
match, you will have the option of creating new blank sections of that type in the active Arranger track, or simply skipping sections of
that type.

Deleting Arranger templates
To delete an Arranger template, do one of the following:

 In the Media Browser, select the Arranger Templates content location preset, then right-click the template you want to delete and
select Delete.

 In Windows Explorer, navigate to C:\Cakewalk Content\Cakewalk Core\Arranger Templates and delete the desired
Arranger template (.arr) file.

Arranger template location and naming convention
Cakewalk includes many Arranger templates that are based on common song forms such as AB, AABA, ABC, etc., where A
typically refers to the Verse, B refers to the Chorus, and C refers to the Bridge.
By default, Arranger templates are stored in C:\Cakewalk Content\Cakewalk Core\Arranger Templates. The folder
location can be specified in Edit > Preferences > File - Folder Locations under Arranger Templates.
The Media Browser also has an Arranger Templates content location preset that points to C:\Cakewalk Content\Cakewalk
Core\Arranger Templates.

Arranging tracks
Cakewalk provides a variety of commands that let you work with the tracks in your project. Here are some of the things you can do.
You can

Here’s why

Rearrange the tracks in the Track view so that This makes it easier to see and work with a subset of tracks, like the rhythm section, or the vocals
they appear in a different order
and vocal backing tracks, or all muted tracks.
Hide individual tracks

This makes it easier to work in a large project. You can display only the tracks you want to see at a
given time.

Move tracks into a track folder

Lets you group tracks by function, edit several tracks at once, hide groups of tracks easily, and
mute, solo, archive, arm, or input monitor a group or tracks with one click. See “Track folders” on
page 549 for more information.

Make copies of a track

Copying a track and then adding a time offset or changing the patch is an easy way to double a
part. You can also copy and then transpose a track to add harmony.

Erase or delete a track

Tracks and clips that you are no longer using in your project are distracting and take up space in
your project file.

All the commands you use to arrange tracks work on selected tracks. The current track (the one with the lighter track name
background color) is always selected. You can select additional tracks as shown in the following table.

To do this

Do this

Select a track

Click the track number in the Track view. The track is selected, and all other tracks—except the
current track—are deselected.
When a track is selected, both the track number and all the data in the track appear highlighted.

Select several adjacent tracks

Click the track number for the first track in the group, drag the mouse to the last track number in
the group, and release the mouse button.

Select/deselect all tracks

Double-click a track number.

Add or remove a single track from the selection

Hold the SHIFT key and click the track number to add it to the selection; hold the CTRL key and
click the track number to toggle its selection status.

Select all buses that a track is routed to (via
output or sends).

Hold down the ALT key and click the track number.

Note: Track selection gestures also apply to buses. For details, see “Bus selection” on page 984.

Changing the order of tracks
There are several ways you can change the order of tracks in the Track view:

 Drag a track to a new position in the Track view.
 Use the Track view Tracks > Sort Tracks command to rearrange the tracks in order based on the track name, status, or other
setting.

To drag a track to a new position
1. Position the mouse just to the right of the track number, over the track icon of the track you want to move.
The cursor changes to an up/down arrow.
2. Drag the track to its new location, and release the mouse button.
Cakewalk rearranges and renumbers the tracks.

Tip: You can reorder multiple tracks simultaneously by dragging in the Track pane. To do so, select the tracks that you want to reorder,
then drag any selected track.
Restrictions:
• You can’t move the selection on or before tracks within the selection (i.e. in effect trying to move it onto itself)
• You can’t move a selection containing track folders into a track folder (nested folders are currently not supported)
• If a track folder is selected (whether or not all the tracks within the folder are selected or not), the whole track folder is
moved, unless you are moving selected tracks from within a single track folder out of the track folder.
You can sort the tracks in a project based on several parameters, in either ascending or descending order:
Sort by

What happens

Name

Ascending puts track in alphabetic order, descending puts them in reverse order

Size, output, or channel

Ascending puts them in increasing numeric order, descending puts them in decreasing numeric order

Muted, archived, selected

Ascending puts qualifying tracks at the end, descending puts them at the beginning

No matter how you sort, blank tracks always go to the end of the list.
Note that track numbers are used for reference only. When you re-arrange the order of tracks, they are automatically assigned
sequential numbers based on the order in which they are displayed in the Track view.

To sort the tracks
1. Click the Track view Tracks menu and choose Sort Tracks to open the Sort Tracks dialog box.
2. Choose the attribute by which to sort from the Sort By list:
Attribute

How it works

Name

If you choose this attribute, Cakewalk puts the tracks into alphabetical order, either ascending or descending, depending on
what you choose in the Order list.

Muted

If you choose this attribute, Cakewalk puts all the muted tracks at either the top or bottom of the Tracks window, depending
on whether you choose descending (top) or ascending (bottom) in the Order list.

Archived

If you choose this attribute, Cakewalk puts all the archived tracks at either the top or bottom of the Tracks window, depending
on whether you choose descending (top) or ascending (bottom) in the Order list.

Selected

If you choose this attribute, Cakewalk puts all the selected tracks at either the top or bottom of the Tracks window, depending
on whether you choose descending (top) or ascending (bottom) in the Order list.

Size

If you choose this attribute, Cakewalk puts the tracks in order by size, either in descending or ascending order.

Output

If you choose this attribute, Cakewalk sorts the tracks by output number, either in descending or ascending order. Cakewalk
considers non-numbered outputs to have lower numbers than numbered outputs.

Channel

If you choose this attribute, Cakewalk sorts the tracks by channel number, either in descending or ascending order:
• If you choose ascending order, Cakewalk puts all MIDI tracks at the bottom of the Tracks window, with the lower channel
numbers first.
• If you choose descending order, Cakewalk puts all MIDI tracks at the top of the Tracks window, with the higher channel
numbers first.

3. Choose the order in which to sort from the Order list.
4. Click OK.
Cakewalk sorts the tracks according to the settings you chose.

Inserting tracks
You can insert new tracks by a variety of methods. When you insert multiple tracks, you can set track output properties at the same
time. If you want new audio tracks to always use the same output bus, you can set that bus as the default bus.
For step-by-step instructions, follow these procedures:

To insert a single track
Do one of the following:

 Click the Insert menu and choose Audio Track or MIDI Track.
 Right-click in the Track pane at the place where you want to insert a track, and select Insert Audio Track to add an audio track or
Insert MIDI Track to add a MIDI track.

 Press INSERT to add a track of the same type (audio or MIDI) as the current track.
 Click the Add Track button

in the Track view to open the Add Track menu.

Cakewalk shifts the current track and all tracks below it down by one, and inserts a blank, new track at the location of the highlight.

To insert multiple tracks
1. Use the Insert > Multiple Tracks command to open the Insert Tracks dialog box.
2. If you want to insert audio tracks, do the following:

 Fill in the number of audio tracks you want to insert in the Audio section’s Track Count field.
 Pick a main audio output for the tracks in the Main Destination field.
 If you want the main output that you chose to be the default output for new audio tracks, enable the Set as Default Bus check
box. You can also choose the default bus by right-clicking a bus, and choosing Set as Default Bus from the pop-up menu.

 If you want your new audio tracks to contain a Send module that outputs to a specific bus, choose the bus in the Send field. If
you choose None, the new audio tracks will not contain a Send module.
3. If you want to insert MIDI tracks, do the following:

 Fill in the number of MIDI tracks you want to insert in the MIDI section’s Track Count field.
 Pick a MIDI output for the tracks in the Port field.
 Pick a MIDI output channel for the tracks in the Channel field.
4. Click OK to insert your tracks, or click Cancel to cancel the operation.
Your new tracks appear below any pre-existing tracks, with new audio tracks appearing above new MIDI tracks.
Note: You can also choose the default output bus for new audio tracks by right-clicking a bus, and choosing Set as Default
Bus from the pop-up menu.

Arranging clips
The Track view provides many ways for you to rearrange, copy, and paste clips to arrange your music the way you want. The easiest
is to select the clips or portions of clips you want to arrange and then drag and drop them wherever you want. You can drag and drop
clips in the Track view even while playback is in progress. You can also arrange clips via the Clipboard using the Edit > Cut, Edit >
Copy, and Edit > Paste commands, which work like those in almost all Windows programs.
The snap grid enables you to move clips to or by an exact amount of time, such as a quarter note or whole measure. See “To
change the snap options” on page 514.
See:
“Displaying clips” on page 489
“Opening views by double-clicking clips” on page 495
“Selecting clips” on page 496
“Moving and copying clips” on page 498

Displaying clips
Clips are displayed as rectangles in the Clips pane. Their position and length show you at a glance their starting times and lengths.
You can control four aspects of their appearance:

 Color. By default, each track’s clips are drawn in a different color. The clip colors restart at the tenth track. You can customize
the default colors of clips in Edit > Preferences > Customization - Color, or change the color of any individual clip in the Clip
Properties Inspector.
Note: In audio clips, the waveform changes color, unless no clip contents are displayed. In MIDI clips, the clip background
changes color.

 Name. You can also assign each clip a descriptive name, which is displayed in the upper-left corner of the clip.
 Contents. At your option, clips can be displayed with a graphical representation of the events in the clip. The effect is slightly
different for MIDI and audio information.

A

B

C
A. A MIDI clip shows each event; by looking at the clips, you can “see” the notes that are being played B. An audio clip shows the actual
waveform C. Controller or automation data are also displayed

To inspect the clip contents more closely, use the zoom tools to increase the size in which clips are displayed. Note that displaying
the contents of each clip makes your computer work a little harder. As a result, if your computer has an older, slower CPU you may
want to turn off the display of clip contents.

Moving and copying clips
You can copy or move clips using drag-and-drop editing or the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands. If you copy or move clips into
tracks that contain existing material, you need to let Cakewalk know how to combine the two.
You have these options:
Option

How it works

Blend Old and New

Events in the copied or moved clip are placed into a new clip that overlaps with the existing clip. This is the
same effect as sound-on-sound recording.

Replace Old with New

Events in the copied or moved clip are placed into a new clip, and any overlapping events in the existing clip
are erased. This is the same effect as overwrite recording.

When you use the Edit > Paste Special command to add information to a track that contains existing material, there is one final
option you can choose.
Option

What it means

Paste as New Clips

New clips are created containing the events on the Clipboard, exactly as described in the
preceding table.

Paste into Existing Clips (MIDI clips only)

The events on the Clipboard are merged into any existing clips that occupy the same region of
time. This means you will never end up with clips that overlap.

Note that if you copy or move clips to new, empty tracks, you don’t have to worry about these settings. In this case, the track
properties that go with the clips are automatically applied to the new track.
When you use drag-and-drop editing:

 You can set the above options every time you perform an edit, or you can set them once and have the same settings carry over
automatically. Check or uncheck the Ask This Every Time box in the Drag and Drop Options dialog box to indicate your
preference. To open the Drag and Drop Options dialog box, click the Track view Options menu and choose Drag and Drop
Options.

 If you drag to the edge of the Clips pane, it will scroll automatically in the direction you drag.
 If you change your mind while dragging clips, press the ESC key to cancel the operation.
Cakewalk also lets you move and copy clips between projects.

To move clips using drag and drop
1. Select the clips you want to move.
2. If you want to move the clips by an exact amount of time, enable the snap grid (see “To change the snap options” on page 514
and “Aim Assist line” on page 502).
3. Select the Smart tool

or Move tool

in the Control Bar.

4. Position the mouse over one of the selected clips.
5. Press and hold down the left mouse button. A rectangle is displayed around the selected clips.
6. Drag the clips to their new location, and release the mouse button.
7. If necessary, choose the options you want from the Drag and Drop Options dialog box (go to Edit > Preferences >
Customization - Editing, or click the Track view Options menu and select Drag and Drop Options), and click OK.

To choose a specific start time and/or length for a clip
1. Select the clip you want to edit.
2. Open the Clip Properties Inspector and select the Properties section.
3. In the Time Format field, choose the units you want to use for the new start time and/or length by clicking one of the radio
buttons:

 M:B:T. Click this if you want the clip to begin and end on a specific measure, beat, or tick.
 Samples. Click this is you want the clip to begin and end on a specific sample.
 H:M:S:F. Click this is you want the clip to begin and end on a specific hour, minute, second, or frame. This is also known as
SMPTE time, and lets you start the clip at an absolute-time-based (as opposed to musical-time-based) point in your project.

 Seconds. Click this is you want the clip to begin and end on a specific second.
4. In the Start and Length fields, enter a new start time and/or length, or use the spinners or keyboard to change values.
5. Choose a value in the Time Base field—choose one of the two options in this section to control what happens to the clip’s start
time when you change the tempo:

 Musical (M:B:T). If the clip is set to the Musical time base, the clip’s M:B:T position stays constant, and its Absolute
(SMPTE) position shifts.

 Absolute (SMPTE). If the clip is set to the Absolute (SMPTE) time base, its Absolute position stays constant, and its M:B:T
position shifts.
Note: The length of a clip may also change when you change the tempo—audio clips maintain their absolute (SMPTE) length,
while a MIDI clip will follow the value in the Time Base field.
Cakewalk adjusts the clip to the values you chose.
Note: The Snap Offset field is for audio clips only. The value of this field is the snap offset of the selected clip, in samples.
When you set a snap offset value for a clip, and then drag the clip, the left edge of the clip does not snap to the current snap
resolution--the clip snaps to a point on the clip that is the distance from the left edge of the clip to the snap offset value. For
example, if you set the snap resolution to move to a measure, and the snap offset of a clip to 1500 samples, when you drag the
clip, instead of the left edge of the clip moving to a measure line, the spot on the clip that's 1500 samples right of the beginning
of the clip moves to the measure line.

Reverting clip(s) to original time stamp
All audio and MIDI clips in Cakewalk have a Original Time property, which stores the original SMPTE time stamp associated with a
clip. The Original Time clip property is based on absolute time, not tempo. This allows you to freely re-arrange clips and later revert
them back to their original time.
Cakewalk automatically assigns the Original Time property during import or immediately after record. When an audio clip containing
a SMPTE time stamp is imported into Cakewalk (such as a Broadcast Wave file), the Original Time field is populated with this time
stamp. When opening previous Cakewalk projects, existing clips will be populated with their current time.
Note: The Original Time property can not be edited. If a clip is bounced to a new clip, the Original Time stamp will not
propagate to the new clip.

2. From the pop-up menu, choose one of the following commands:

 Clip Lock > Lock Position. In lock mode, this choice locks position only, and causes a yellow lock icon with the clasp
unlocked to appear on the clip. If data is already locked, then both position and data become locked, and a “locked” lock icon
appears on the clip. In unlock mode, if both position and data are locked, and you unlock position, then the blue “unlocked”
lock icon appears on the clip, meaning that only data is locked.

 Clip Lock > Lock Data. In lock mode, this choice locks data only, and causes a blue lock icon with the clasp unlocked to

on the clip. In unlock mode, if both position and data are locked, and you unlock data, then the yellow “unlocked” lock icon
appears on the clip, meaning that only position is locked.
Note: If a clip’s position is locked, and you change tempo, what happens to the clip’s position depends on what option the Clip
Properties Time Base field is set to: Musical (M:B:T), or Absolute (SMPTE). If the clip is set to the Musical time base, the
clip’s M:B:T position stays constant, and its Absolute position shifts. If the clip is set to the Absolute time base, its Absolute
position does not move, but its M:B:T position shifts.

Auto scroll lock in Clips pane
While editing, you can prevent the Clips pane from scrolling horizontally during playback. This allows you to focus on the edit
location without worrying that the screen will eventually scroll away from the edit location.
When the Left Click Locks Scroll option is enabled (default behavior), the Clips pane will not scroll if you click any object in the
Clips pane. When you are done with the edit and want the Clips pane to scroll again during playback, click in the background of the
Clips pane to clear auto scroll lock.

To enable/disable auto scroll lock
Click the Track view Options menu, point to Click Behavior and choose Left Click Locks Scroll on the submenu.

Ripple editing
Ripple editing means to adjust the position of a clip in the Track view, and automatically adjust the start position of all subsequent
clips to compensate for the change.
Ripple editing is a convenient way to arrange clips and maintain sync relationships without leaving unintended gaps between the
clips.
You can choose to ripple edit just the selection, or all tracks plus meter/key changes, tempo changes, and markers.

Caution: Use caution when ripple editing, and make sure you don’t unintentionally move track data that is off screen. It is good
practice to check the results often when editing multiple tracks.

Tip: If you don’t want a clip to be affected by ripple editing, lock its position before editing. For details, see “Locking Clips” on page 504.

To enable/disable ripple editing
Do one of the following:

 Click the Ripple Edit On/Off button

. Long press or right-click the button to specify the ripple edit mode.

 Click the Track view Options menu and select one of the following options:
 Ripple Edit Selection. Affects all clips that are downstream from the selected clip(s). Locked clips are ignored.
 Ripple Edit All. In addition to downstream clips in all tracks, also affects meter/key changes, tempo changes, and markers.
Locked markers are ignored.
Figure 200. Ripple Edit On/Off button.

Tip: Assign the Ripple Edit Selection and Ripple Edit All commands to keyboard shortcuts so you can quickly enable/disable ripple
editing. For details, see “Key bindings” on page 1261.

What works with ripple editing?
The following operations in the Track view support ripple editing:

 Moving clips.
 Delete, cut, and paste.
 Nudge.
 Changing the clip Start time in the Clip Properties Inspector.
 Process > Slide.
 Import audio/MIDI.
 Delete empty space.

Note: Automation envelopes follow when ripple editing clips.

To delete empty space (close a gap)
1. Click the Track view Options menu and select Ripple Edit Selection or Ripple Edit All.
2. Drag in the time ruler or Clips pane to select the time range you want to delete, then go to Edit > Delete or press the DELETE
key.

Clip selection groups
Cakewalk lets you treat multiple clips as a single unit. By grouping clips, you can select and edit an entire group of clips by simply
selecting or editing any group member. A group can contain both audio and MIDI clips from a single track or from multiple tracks.
Clip groups are very useful, for example, when editing multitrack drums and you want to synchronize edits on all clips from the same
recording take.
You can instruct Cakewalk to automatically group clips after recording multiple tracks simultaneously, or you can add and remove
clips from a group after the clips have been recorded.
Grouped clips are indicated by a group number before the clip name.
Figure 201. Grouped clips.
A

A. The group number is displayed next to the clip name

To group clips during multitrack recording
You can specify how clips should be grouped when recording multiple tracks simultaneously.
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Record, or right-click the Record button to access recording settings.
2. Under Multi-Track Grouping, select one of the following options:

 Group all clips. All clips that are recorded at the same time are placed in a clip group.
 Group only clips in folders (default). All clips in folders are grouped. Different folders have different groups. Tracks not in
folders are not grouped.

 Do not group tracks. Each new take will belong to a different clip group if loop recording is enabled.
After recording is complete, all new clips are grouped together. When loop recording, each pass of the loop gets placed in its own
group.
Two discrete steps are placed in the Undo history. The first step is the actual recording and the second step is for Create Clip Group.
This allows you to undo the clip group, if desired, without losing the recording.

Using editing tools on grouped clips
The Select, Mute and Split tools behave as follows when editing grouped clips:

 Select tool

:

 Clicking a clip in a group will also select all other clips in the same group.
 Lasso-selecting will select clips that are touched by the lasso as well as other clips in the same group that intersect the lasso
time range.

 Split tool

:

 Clicking an unselected clip will split that clip and all other clips in the same group that intersect the split time.
 If a previous selection exists, clicking will split only the clips in the selection.
 Selecting a range will split all clips in the group that intersect that range.

508

Arranging and editing
Clip selection groups

 Mute tool

. The Mute tool has several modes of operation. The corresponding mode is indicated in square brackets.

 [Mute Entire Clips mode] Clicking an unselected clip will mute that clip and all other clips in the same group.
 [Mute Entire Clips mode] If a previous selection exists, clicking will mute only the clips in the selection.
 [Mute Entire Clips mode] Lasso-selecting will mute clips that are touched by the lasso as well as other clips in the same group
that intersect the lasso time range.

 [Mute Time Ranges mode] Selecting a range will mute all clips in the group that intersect that time range.
Note: Muting a time range is limited to one track or Take lane at a time.

 [Isolate mode] Isolate mode does not follow clip groups for clips that live in the same track.
Cakewalk can automatically create a new clip group when splitting clips in an existing clip group. To specify the split behavior, follow
these steps:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Customization - Editing.
2. Under Clips, select the When Splitting Clips in Groups, Create New Groups check box.
For more information about splitting clips, see “Splitting and combining clips” on page 520.

Copying and pasting grouped clips
When you copy and paste clips that belong to a clip group, you can specify if the pasted clips should be placed in a new clip group or
continue to be grouped with the original clip group. By default, a new clip group is created. You can change the behavior by adding
the following line to the [WinCake] section of the Cakewalk.ini file:
[WinCake]
CreateNewGroupsOnPaste=1
The values are as follows:
0 = The pasted clips will belong to the same clip group as the clips that were copied.
1 = A new clip group is created for the pasted clips. This is the default behavior.
To view and edit the Cakewalk.ini file, go to Edit > Preferences > File - Initialization File.

Nudge
Nudging is moving a clip or a MIDI note by a small amount to the left or right or up and down. There are three customizable settings
for the Nudge feature. You can also nudge clips (in the Track view) or notes (in the Piano Roll view) up or down, and you can use
keyboard shortcuts (see “To Nudge a Clip Using Keyboard Shortcuts” on page 511).
See:
“Nudge settings” on page 510

Nudge settings
To configure the three nudge settings, go to Edit > Preferences > Customization - Nudge or Process > Nudge > Settings.

To Nudge a Clip Left or Right
Use the following procedure to nudge a clip.
1. Select the clip you want to nudge.
2. Select Process > Nudge Left(1-3) from the menu to move the clip left or Process > Nudge Right(1-3) to move the clip right.
The amount the clip or note moves is determined by the settings in Edit > Preferences > Customization - Nudge.

To Nudge a Clip Up and Down
Use the following procedure to nudge a clip (in the Track view) or MIDI note (in the Piano Roll view) up or down.
1. Select the clip or note you want to nudge.
2. Select Process > Nudge > Up to move the clip or note up or Process > Nudge > Down to move a clip or note down.
Clips move up or down one track at a time. Notes move up or down one pitch at a time.

To Change Nudge Settings
1. Select Process > Nudge > Settings to access nudge settings.
2. In one of the three Nudge groups, select one of the following:

 Musical Time. Select a note length setting.
 Absolute Time. Select one of the following absolute time options and a number in the first field:
Absolute time setting

Description

Seconds

Whole seconds.

Milliseconds

Thousands of a second.

Frames

Number of frames. The default frame count is 30 frames per second. The number of frames varies
depending on the setting in Edit > Preferences > Project - Clock.

Samples

A very small amount of time. For CD-quality audio there are 44,100 samples per second, so a value of 1 here
would not move a clip by a perceptible amount.

Ticks

The number of ticks per quarter note varies depending on the setting in Edit > Preferences > Project Clock. The default setting is 960.

 Follow Snap Settings. Moves the clip or note by the current snap setting.

Working with partial clips
Cakewalk lets you select, copy, move, and delete portions of a project even if they do not match clip boundaries. There are two ways
to do this:

 Directly select portions of one or more clips.
 Select a range of times and one or more tracks. Cakewalk automatically selects the portions of clips that are in both the selected
time range and the selected tracks. You can then copy, move, or delete the material the same way you do with whole clips. When
you select portions of a clip, Cakewalk may round off the start and end times of your selection based on the snap grid. For more
information, see “Defining and using the Snap Grid” on page 513.

To select a portion of a clip
Select the Smart tool

or Select tool

in the Control Bar and drag across the bottom half of a clip.

Cakewalk highlights the selected portion of the clip. You can edit this portion of the clip using all the normal editing commands.

To select a portion of several clips

Markers and the snap grid
Cakewalk has a collection of features you can use to simplify and speed the work you do arranging your projects. Here are a few of
the most important things you can do:

 Show grid lines on measure boundaries in the Track view.
 Define and use the snap grid to make drag-and-drop editing more accurate.
 Create markers to identify and work with key time points in your project.
See:
“Showing grid lines” on page 513
“Defining and using the Snap Grid” on page 513
“Snap offsets” on page 515
“Creating and using markers” on page 515

Showing grid lines
Displaying grid lines, or vertical rules, in the Clips pane of the Track view makes it easy to see at a glance how clips align with each
other, how they align with measure boundaries, and when they start and end.

To show/hide vertical grid lines
1. Click the Track view View menu, point to Display > Vertical Grid Lines and select one of the following options:

 None. No vertical grid lines are displayed
 Behind Clips. Vertical grid lines are displayed, but clips will draw on top of them, so clip contents will not be obstructed.
 In Front of Clips. Vertical grid lines are displayed and drawn on top of clips, always visible.
Cakewalk displays the Track view as you requested.

Defining and using the Snap Grid
Cakewalk lets you define a snap grid that makes it easier to arrange clips, select time ranges, and control envelope shape drawing.
To use the snap grid, enable the Snap to Grid button
in the Control Bar’s Snap module (or press N) and set the grid resolution
to an interval of musical time, such as a whole note, half note, or quarter note; a unit of absolute time: a number of frames, seconds
or samples; an event; the start or end of a clip; a marker; or audio transients. The grid can use multiple resolutions at the same time,
such as a whole note, and audio transients. When the Snap to Grid button is enabled, if you move or paste clips or markers, items
will be snapped to the nearest point on the snap grid.
You can also use the snap grid to move clips by a certain interval, rather than snap them to the interval. Moving by an interval can
be useful during drag-and-drop operations, if your data are not exactly aligned with measure or note boundaries. To set advanced
Snap to Grid settings, go to Edit > Preferences > Customization - Snap to Grid.
Magnetic snap. Cakewalk’s snap grid has an option called magnetic snap. This means that when you’re dragging the boundary of
an object, you can move the boundary freely until the boundary gets within a certain number of ticks from the snap target. The closer
the object gets to the snap target, the more strongly the object is pulled to the target. You can set the strength of magnetic snap to
low, medium, high, or off. Note that if you are zoomed out a certain amount, the time boundary around the snap target will appear to
be quite small, and you might think that the snap grid is not functioning. If this is the case, zoom in closer to enhance your editing
experience. If you’re dragging a whole clip, magnetic snap is not in effect.

To enable or disable the Snap Grid
Do one of the following:

 Click the Snap to Grid button

in the Control Bar’s Snap module.

 Press N.

Arranging and editing
Markers and the snap grid

To change the snap options
1. In the Control Bar’s Snap module, select one or more of the following resolution options:

 Time resolution. Snap to the selected musical or absolute time resolution. Click and hold the mouse button pressed to
select a different duration from the pop-up menu. For absolute time resolutions (samples, frames, seconds), type the desired
number of units. When Smart Grid is selected, the snap resolution is dynamically determined by the horizontal zoom level,
and the M:B:T Time Rulers in the Clips pane and Piano Roll view are optimized to show relevant snap locations.
Note: To exit Smart Grid mode, clear the Smart Grid check mark. If you manually select a new resolution while Smart Grid is
enabled, the new settings only apply until the focused view's zoom level changes.

 Triplet

. Reduces the duration of the selected Musical time resolution by 2/3 of its original duration. When Triplet is
enabled, three note events fit in the space of two.

 Dotted

. Increase the duration of the selected Musical time resolution by half of its original value (150%).

 Snap To. Align data to the snap grid.
 Snap By. Move data by the grid resolution.
 Landmark Events

. Snap to the selected landmarks, including markers, Now Time, clips, audio transients, MIDI notes,

and automation envelope nodes. To select the desired landmarks, right-click the Snap to Grid button
to open the
Preferences dialog, then select the desired check boxes in the Landmarks section. Cakewalk will snap to landmarks on
tracks/lanes that are currently visible in the Clips pane.
2. Go to Edit > Preferences > Customization - Snap to Grid.
3. If you want to change the magnetic snap strength, or turn off magnetic snap, adjust the Snap Intensity slider.
4. If you want to automatically snap edited audio clips to the nearest zero crossing of the waveform (the point at which there is no
volume, to minimize the glitches that can happen when waveforms are spliced together) select the Snap to Nearest Audio Zero
Crossings check box.
5. Click OK to close the dialog box.
All time selections and drag-and-drop editing operations use the new snap grid resolution(s).

To use a secondary Snap to Grid resolution
By default, Cakewalk uses the global Snap to Grid settings when snap is enabled. However, you can also specify a secondary Snap
to Grid resolution that is in effect when holding down the N key.
To assign the secondary Snap to Grid settings, hold down the N key while selecting the desired snap settings in the Control Bar’s
Snap module.
To momentarily apply the secondary Snap to Grid resolution, hold down the N key while dragging or editing data that is snapping to
the grid. When the N key is released, the main global snap settings are restored.
To swap the primary and secondary Snap to Grid settings, press CTRL+SHIFT+N.
Note: To enable/disable Snap to Grid, press the N key quickly. To assign or use the secondary Snap to Grid resolution, keep
the N key pressed.

Tip: You can configure the secondary Snap to Grid resolution to effectively bypass snapping when holding down the N key. To do so,
hold down the N key while disabling the snap resolution and snap landmarks in the Control Bar’s Snap module. Snapping will now be
temporarily disabled while you hold down the N key.

Markers and the snap grid

Snap offsets
Snap offsets allow you to set a point other than the beginning of a clip as the “snap” point used by the Snap to Grid. A snap offset is
the number of samples from the beginning of the clip. Snap offsets affect all edits that obey the Snap to Grid setting. Once the snap
offset is added, you can set the Timer Ruler to SMPTE or MBT time.
Note: You cannot set a snap offset for a Groove clip.

Creating a snap offset
Use the following to add a snap offset to a clip:
1. Locate the place in the clip where you want to put the snap offset, and set the Now Time to that location. Use the Scrub tool if
necessary.
2. Right-click on the clip and select Set Snap Offset to Now Time from the menu that appears.
Edits to that clip, when the Snap to Grid button is depressed, now snap to the snap offset rather than the beginning of the clip.

Deleting a snap offset
1. Select the clip.
2. Open the Clip Properties Inspector and select the Properties section.
3. Click the Snap Offset field and type 0.

Creating and using markers
Markers are a way of associating a name with a time point in your project. You use markers to name sections of a project, to mark hit
points in a film score, or simply to provide a shortcut for working with any time point in a project. Markers make it easy to:

 Jump to a specific time point in a project.
 Select a portion of a project.
 Enter a time in any dialog box, by pressing G and choosing the marker you want.
You can see and work with markers in four ways:

 They are displayed in the Time Ruler at the top of the Track, Staff, and Piano Roll view.
 The Markers module in the Control Bar lets you add markers and jump to specific marker locations.
 The Markers view displays all markers and lets you add, edit, and delete markers.
 You can press M while playback is in progress to add a marker on the fly.
The time associated with a marker can be expressed in musical time or as a locked SMPTE time. If a marker has a musical time
(measures, beats, and ticks), the marker stays at that musical time regardless of changes in tempo. If a marker has a locked SMPTE
time (hours, minutes, seconds, and frames), the marker stays at the same time even when the tempo is changed. Locked markers
are useful for projects that require you to sync the music or sound with film scores or multimedia presentations. See “To add a
marker” on page 516.
Cakewalk takes the current snap grid settings into account when you move or copy markers. For example, if the snap grid is set to
even measure boundaries, any time you move or copy a marker, the marker will be snapped to the beginning of the nearest
measure. You are allowed to have any number of markers at a single time point. To display the Markers view, choose Views >
Markers. From the Markers view, you can use the File > Print and File > Print Preview commands to print a listing of markers.

TAB to transients

Note: As of Cakewalk version 2021.12, the TAB key is now longer assigned to “Tab to transients”. You can re-enable this function
again in Edit > Preferences > Customization - Keyboard Shortcuts; bind the TAB key to AudioSnap Go To Next Transient
Marker and bind SHIFT+TAB to AudioSnap Go To Previous Transient Marker. For details, see “Key bindings” on page 1261.
You can use the TAB and SHIFT+TAB keys to jump to audio transients, and MIDI Note events. Tabbing is only possible when the
transport is not rolling.
TAB to transients is selection-based, which means tabbing will go to the next/previous transient amongst all selected clips. If there is
no selection, tabbing operates on the current track.

Working with linked clips
Cakewalk makes it easy to repeat a pattern over and over using a feature called linked clips. Linked clips always have the same
contents, name, and display color. Any change you make to the internal contents of one of the clips, such as adding or editing notes
or effects, automatically applies to all of them. Any number of clips may be linked with each other. To create linked clips, copy the
clips and when pasting, check the Linked Clips option in the Paste dialog box or the Drag and Drop Options dialog box. Linked
clips are displayed with a dotted border, so they are easy to spot. You can also identify linked clips from the Clip Properties Inspector
or by using the Select All Siblings command in the Clips pane context menu. You can easily unlink linked clips, and then edit them
individually. You have two options when unlinking linked clips:
Option

How it works

New linked group

The clips you selected will still be linked to each other, but won’t be linked to any clips that are not selected

Independent

Every selected clip will be completely independent

Once you have unlinked linked clips, you cannot re-link them except by using Edit > Undo.
If you attempt to copy only a portion of a linked clip, the copy will not be linked to the original. Copies of a clip can be linked to the
original only when you select and copy the entire clip.

To make linked copies of a clip using drag and drop
1. Click the Track view Options menu and choose Drag & Drop Options to display the Drag and Drop Options dialog box.
2. Select the option labeled Copy Entire Clips as Linked Clips.
3. Click OK.
4. Select the clips you want to copy.
5. Position the mouse over one of the selected clips.
6. Press and hold down the CTRL key.
7. Press and hold down the left mouse button. A rectangle is displayed around the selected clips.
8. Drag the clips to their new location, and release the mouse button.
9. If necessary, confirm the options in the Drag and Drop Options dialog box, and click OK.
Cakewalk creates copies of the selected clips that are linked to the originals. Any change you make to one of the clips is applied to
all linked clips, including the original clip.

To make linked copies of a clip using copy and paste
1. Select the clips you want to copy.
2. Choose Edit > Copy Special to display the Copy dialog box.
3. Choose options as desired and click OK. Cakewalk copies the clips to the Clipboard.
4. Click in the Track pane to set the current track to be the one where clips should be pasted.
5. Set the Now time to be the time at which the clips should be pasted.
6. Choose Edit > Paste Special to display the Paste dialog box.
7. In the Paste dialog box, choose one of two options:

 Linked Repetitions. If you choose this option, only the new copies of the original clip are linked together. Edits you make to
the new copies do not affect the original, and vice versa.

 Link to Original Clip(s). If you choose this option, the new copies and the original clip are linked together. Edits you make
to any of the linked clips, including the original, affect all other linked clips in the group.
8. Choose the other options you want and click OK.
Cakewalk creates copies of the selected clips that are linked in the way you chose.

3. Choose the unlink option you want, and click OK.
Cakewalk unlinks the clips and updates the Clips pane accordingly. From now on, any changes you make to one of the clips are
applied only to remaining linked clips, if any.

To select the clips that are linked to another clip
1. Select one or more clips in the Track view.
2. Right-click on any selected clip and choose Select All Siblings from the pop-up menu.
Cakewalk selects any clip that is linked to one of the currently selected clips.

Splitting and combining clips
Cakewalk provides several commands that are used to split and combine clips. Specifically, you can:

 Split a clip into several smaller clips
 Create a new clip from a selected portion of an existing clip
 Combine adjacent or overlapping clips into a single, longer clip
The following table summarizes the commands you can use.
To do this

Use this command

Notes

Split clips into parts

•

Works on all selected clips.
By default, MIDI notes that overlap the split position will also be split, and
MIDI chase events (such as continuous controllers, Pitch Wheel, and
Patch Change) are inserted at the split position. You can enable/disable
this behavior with the Split MIDI Notes option in Edit > Preferences >
Customization - Editing (see “Customization - Editing (Advanced)” on
page 1728).

•

Combine several clips into one

Right-click the clip and choose
Split on the context menu
Press S

Click the Track view Clips menu
and choose Bounce to Clip(s)

If the selected clips are in separate tracks, one clip is created for each
track. All clip automation is applied destructively to the new clip.

Note: Combining a stereo and mono clip always produces a stereo clip.

The Split command lets you split clips four different ways.
Option

How it works

Split at Time

Splits selected clips at a specific point in time. By default, the split occurs at the Now time, but you can choose any
time you want.

Split Repeatedly

Splits selected clips at regular intervals, beginning at a specified time, with a specified duration. For example, you
could split a long clip into 4-bar clips starting at measure 5.

Split at Markers

Splits selected clips at any marker location. This option is available only if your project has markers.

Split when Silent

Removes “silent” stretches of one measure or more from selected clips. The presence in a measure of any event—
including those that make no sound, such as a patch change or lyric event—will cause that measure to be retained.

While the Split command works for both MIDI and audio clips, for audio clips, the Split command provides sample accurate editing
and snap-to-zero capability. Note that the Edit > Undo and Edit > Redo commands work with all three of these editing commands.
Cakewalk allows you to specify what is selected after a clip is split into two parts:

 Left portion (default). Only the left portion is selected.

Take lanes
Take lanes provide an alternative method of viewing and editing overlapping clips on tracks. Overlapping clips can occur when you
record multiple takes on the same track. Take lanes can be expanded or collapsed on each track. When expanded, Take lanes are
indented below the parent track. Take lanes can be created, hidden, and removed, and each track can have an unlimited number of
lanes.
Take lanes provide many benefits, including:

 Better visibility of clip data.
 Less screen clutter on track strips.
 Ability to quickly mute and solo individual takes.
 Better workflow for creating a final composite take out of many separate takes.
To show a track’s Take lanes, click the track’s Expand/collapse Take lanes button

.

Figure 205. Take lanes expanded.

A

B

A. Parent track B. Take lanes

When you view clips in separate Take lanes, it’s easy to mute and solo them individually and eventually come up with a composite
take, with only the best clips playing back.
When you use loop recording, you can store all your takes in the same track, and then use the Mute tool or “Audition (selection
playback)” on page 528 to hear only the ones you want.
If you enable a track’s Expand/collapse Take Lanes button
of the following happens:

, Cakewalk moves the track’s clips to separate lanes whenever any

 You use loop recording in Comping or Sound on Sound mode, and choose to store takes in a single track.
 You record over some pre-existing data while in Sound on Sound mode.
 The track contains at least one overlapping clip.

Note: The Smart tool
is powerful, but may produce unintended results in certain situations, such as inadvertently isolating
clips in Take lanes when clicking the bottom half of clips. If you are not strictly using Take lanes for comping, you may want to
disable the Smart tool’s comping behavior. To do so, long press or right-click the Smart tool button
menu, then clear the Comp option. For details, see “To customize the Smart tool” on page 577.

Comping
There are various methods you can use to record your best performance. Comping refers to the process of recording multiple takes,
then assembling a final “composite” track by combining the best parts from each take.
While some musicians can perform a flawless performance in a single take, most people typically record several takes so they have
a few alternative versions of the same performance in case there are any mistakes they want to fix later.
Instead of using punch recording to painstakingly record multiple short “perfect” takes, it is often a better approach to record multiple
longer takes, even if they contain mistakes, then isolate the best parts from each take. This approach is usually more relaxed and
allows you to capture a better performance.
Cakewalk makes comping very easy and transparent. You simply click or drag across the takes you want to keep, and Cakewalk
automatically mutes all other overlapping takes on the same track.
There are three primary methods you can use to comp in Cakewalk:

 Comping record mode. The default recording mode in Cakewalk is called Comping. When recording, previously recorded
material on the track is not heard. When a recording is done, the newly recorded material is unmuted and all other takes are
muted for the duration of the new material. Each take appears on its own Take lane, with the newest take on top. For details, see
“Comping record mode” on page 535 and “Recording modes” on page 352.

 Manual comping. When Take lanes are visible on a track, you can use the Smart tool

or Comping tool
to isolate
overlapping takes. Simply click or drag across a take, and all other overlapping takes in the same track are muted. For details, see
“Comping with the Smart tool and Comping tool” on page 538.

 Speed comping. After recording multiple takes, you can audition any individual take, use keyboard shortcut keys to audition
other takes and then select which take you want to use. For details, see “Speed comping” on page 541.
You can use one or more of the different methods to create a perfect comp. Cakewalk will even apply configurable crossfades
between takes automatically, and you can quickly “flatten” the final comp to a new Take lane and mute the original takes.

Basic comping workflow
When comping, you will typically use a workflow that looks similar to this:
1. Record multiple takes to separate Take lanes. You can manually record to one Take lane at a time, or set up loop recording to
automatically create a new Take lane for each repetition. You can also import loops. For details, see “Recording takes” on page
532.
2. Click the track’s Expand/collapse Take Lanes button

(or press SHIFT+T) so Take lanes are visible.

3. Audition takes to identify which takes you want to keep or delete. You can mute and solo individual Take lanes, or audition only
the selected clips or time region by pressing SHIFT+SPACEBAR. For details, see “Auditioning takes” on page 534.
4. Mute or delete any takes you are certain you don’t want to keep. When you are left with two or more good takes, it’s time to pick
the best parts from each take and combine them into a final composite track.

You can also use speed comping for even faster workflow (see “Speed comping” on page 541).
6. Fine-tune the comp, if necessary by adjusting clip start/end times and cross-fades. For details, see “Adjusting crossfades” on
page 543.
7. Finalize the comp by right-clicking the Comp clip and selecting Flatten Comp on the pop-up menu. For details, see “Finalizing

Note: The original takes are still available after you flatten a comp. This allows you to experiment freely and create unlimited
alternative comps for each track.

Recording takes
Before comping, you need to record multiple takes on a track. You can manually record to one Take lane at a time, or set up loop
recording to automatically create a new Take lane for each repetition.
A take is any new data brought into a track. It can be recorded audio or MIDI, dragged-in loops, or imported files. If a track has data
on it, it has at least one Take lane. A new Take lane is created for each new take.
Note: In Overwrite record mode, a new Take lane is only created if there is no existing lane. Otherwise, the new data overwrites
existing data on the existing lane.
The following rules apply when recording new takes:

 Take lanes are named automatically. The first lane is named T1, the next lane is named T2, etc. The lane number always stays
with a lane, even if you reorder, insert or delete lanes.

 The newest (chronologically youngest) take is shown on top when displayed in lanes.
 Clips cannot overlap on the same Take lane. If you wish to overlap two clips, place each clip in a separate Take lane. When a clip
is moved, pasted or recorded to a lane, any clip data already in that area will be cropped or removed to accommodate the new
data.

 Click the Take lane’s Solo button

.

Unlike track solo buttons, Take lane solo buttons are mutually exclusive, meaning you can only solo one Take lane on a track at
a time. This allows you to quickly audition or solo a single take since there is no need to first unsolo other takes.When soloed,
time mute (partial clip mute) regions are ignored. You might want to enable looping in order to repeat a specific time region while
you audition different takes.

 Select the desired clip(s) or time region, then press SHIFT+SPACEBAR.
You can use the LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN ARROW keys to audition adjacent takes, then press the ENTER key to isolate the
selected take. This is referred to as speed comping. For details, see “Speed comping” on page 541.
Tip: If you want to audition takes in context with other tracks, enable Dim Solo mode in the Control Bar’s Mix module. For details, see
“Dim Solo mode” on page 300.

 Hold down the J key to enter Scrub mode, then drag across a take.

Comping methods
There are three primary methods you can use to comp in Cakewalk:

 Comping record mode. The default recording mode in Cakewalk is called Comping. When recording, previously recorded
material on the track is not heard. When a recording is done, the newly recorded material is unmuted and all other takes are
muted for the duration of the new material. Each take appears on its own Take lane, with the newest take on top. For details, see
“Comping record mode” on page 535 and “Recording modes” on page 352.

 Manual comping. When Take lanes are visible on a track, you can use the Smart tool

or Comping tool
to isolate
overlapping takes. Simply click or drag across a take, and all other overlapping takes in the same track are muted. For details, see
“Comping with the Smart tool and Comping tool” on page 538.

 Speed comping. After recording multiple takes, you can audition any individual take, use keyboard shortcut keys to audition
other takes and then select which take you want to use. For details, see “Speed comping” on page 541.

Comping record mode
The default recording mode in Cakewalk is called Comping. When recording, previously recorded material on the track is not heard.
When a recording is done, the newly recorded material is unmuted and all other takes are muted for the duration of the new material.

(default)

No

Yes

Yes

When recording, previously recorded material on
the track is not heard. When a recording is done,
the newly recorded material is heard and all other
takes are time-muted for the duration of the new
material.
Comp record mode will record all takes as
independent Take lanes. At the end of a
recording pass, only the most recently recorded
takes will be audible. This is achieved by
automatically comping, isolating the clips in the
recording and muting other clips in existing Take
lanes.
Splits are created in all lanes at the start and end
record times.
All clips within the recorded region are
automatically "healed", removing any
unnecessary splits from prior takes.
All clips in Take lanes that are obscured by the
latest record pass are muted.
The comp splitting process follows the same
logic as the Comping tool, and will mute all clips
that are not part of the latest recording.

Overwrite

No

No (new material

existing clips may be “wiped clean” to make room
for newly recorded material. While recording, you
will not be able to hear material from existing

Comping with the Smart tool and Comping tool
Cakewalk’s Smart tool
or Comping tool
have an isolate function that allows you to select a region on one Take lane and
automatically mute the same region in all other Take lanes on the same track.
The mouse pointer looks like
when comping operations are possible. Simply click a take to isolate the take, or drag to make a
time selection, and Cakewalk automatically mutes all other overlapping takes in the same track. Clips are split, if necessary, in order
to be isolated or muted.
Tip: When comping, enable Aim Assist (Edit > Aim Assist, or press X) so you can clearly see which clips overlap at the position you
click. When you click or drag to isolate a take, any other takes on the same track that intersect the Aim Assist line will be muted.

Note: The Smart tool
is powerful, but may produce unintended results in certain situations, such as inadvertently isolating
clips in Take lanes when clicking the bottom half of clips. If you are not strictly using Take lanes for comping, you may want to
disable the Smart tool’s comping behavior. To do so, long press or right-click the Smart tool button
menu, then clear the Comp option. For details, see “To customize the Smart tool” on page 577.

to open the Smart tool

Figure 210. Click the take you want to isolate.

When a clip is split, the two resulting clips contain identical data, but are cropped differently. Cakewalk will intelligently create as few
clips as possible when comping. If a clip has been split, it can later be “healed” by removing the split. Cakewalk can heal split clips if
two clips are abutting, and contain the identical audio data, as long as the clips have not been moved relative to each other.
or Comping tool
to isolate and mute/unmute, Cakewalk will automatically “heal” any split clips
When you use the Smart tool
if possible in order to reduce the number of clips. You can simply focus on identifying the regions you want to hear (isolate), and
Cakewalk will automatically split, mute/unmute, and heal clips.

6. Repeat steps 3-4 until you have completed the comping.

Tip: If you want to audition takes in context with other tracks, enable Dim Solo mode in the Control Bar’s Mix module. For details, see
“Dim Solo mode” on page 300.

Tip: Before speed comping, you may first want to use the Smart tool or Comping tool to drag across each musical phrase in order to
split the takes into smaller phrases. This makes it easier to quickly mute/unmute shorter phrases while comping. For details, see
“Comping with the Smart tool and Comping tool” on page 538. Also see “Split tool” on page 599 and “Splitting and combining

Adjusting crossfades
When splitting clips as a result of comping, Cakewalk automatically adds a short crossfade between abutting takes. In order to
create a crossfade, clip boundaries must occur at the exact same position on the time line. You can manually adjust the duration of
each crossfade by dragging the crossfade up/down in a Take lane.

Comp clips
When showing multiple Take lanes, the parent track shows a Comp clip that is a visual representation of all overlapping unmuted
takes in the track, but no audio or MIDI data actually exists in a Comp clip. A track can contain multiple Comp clips if there are time
gaps between takes.
When you hide Take lanes, Comp clips are also hidden and the takes are shown as regular clips.
Each Comp clip has a blue unifying header bar, which allows you to select and move the takes as a group, and the clip background
color is slightly darker than regular clips.
Figure 214. The Comp clip is a visual representation of the track’s unmuted takes.

Track folders
A track folder contains tracks in the Track pane of the Track view. Track folders make larger projects much easier to manage—you
can group different types of tracks in their own folder: vocals, soft synths, ReWire instruments, drums, etc.
The main characteristics of a track folder are:

 You can edit all the tracks in the folder as if you were editing a single track—especially valuable for drum tracks. The track folder
displays a composite clip in the Clips pane of all the clips in the folder. Selecting a time range in the composite clip selects data in
all the enclosed tracks in the same time range; now you can edit all the tracks in the folder by editing the selected area of the
composite clip.

 You can hide tracks in a folder, freeing up space on your screen.
 A folder can contain any type of track—you can put MIDI, audio, and synth tracks, and subfolders in the same folder.
 You can archive, mute, solo, arm, or input monitor all the tracks in a folder with one click—just click the Archive, Mute, Solo,
Arm, or Input Echo button on the track folder.

Nested track folders
A nested folder is a subfolder that is contained within another parent folder. Nested subfolders allow you to organize tracks more
logically. For example, you can have a “Guitar” parent folder that contains “Electric” and “Acoustic” subfolders.

To only move tracks into another folder, drag one of the tracks or select Move To... from the context menu of one of the tracks.
To move the entire folder, drag the folder itself onto another folder, or select Move To... from the context menu of the folder.
If a track is in a folder, selecting Move To Folder > New Track Folder will create a new sub-folder at the same level of that track.

Undo, redo, and the undo history
Cakewalk provides very powerful Undo and Redo commands that let you move forward or backward through any portion of an
editing session. Every project has its own independent undo history. This means you can return to any open project and use the
Undo and Redo commands, even if you’ve spent the last hour working on a different project. The undo history of a project is lost
when you close the project.
Remembering everything that is necessary to undo the changes you have made can use a lot of memory. If a change you are about
to make requires too much memory and cannot be undone, you will be advised that the operation is too big to undo later and asked
if you want to go ahead anyway. If you do choose to perform the operation, you will not be able to undo it. Therefore, you may want
to save your project first.
The Edit > History command displays a complete history of the commands and actions you can undo for the current project. The
Undo History dialog box looks like this:
Figure 218. The Undo History dialog box.

A

B

C
A. Most recent change B. Click to clear the undo history C. Adjust the number of steps you can undo

The History command is grayed out until you make a change to the current project that can be undone.
The History list is updated every time you make a change to a project. For example, if you insert a new note into a project using the
Piano Roll view, that action is added to the History list. This entry remains on the list—even if you undo the change—so that you can
redo the change later on. If you delete the note, this change is added to the History list.
You can click the Clear button in the Undo History dialog box to erase the undo history for the current project and free up some
memory. If Cakewalk is low on memory, it may offer to erase the History list. To revert to an earlier version of a project, highlight the
entry in the History list that represents the point to which you’d like to return, and click OK. Cakewalk performs the necessary undo
or redo actions to take you to that point. Once you edit the project (for example, by inserting a note), the History list is truncated at

on the list.
By default, Cakewalk keeps a history of up to 128 editing actions for each open project. Once that limit is reached, each new action
pushes out the oldest item from the History list. You can raise or lower that number in the Undo History dialog box.

Slip-editing (non-destructive editing)
Slip-editing allows you to non-destructively hide or reveal the beginning of a clip, the end of a clip, or both. The hidden material in a
clip is not heard during playback. All hidden material remains intact and can be restored. All slip-editing movements correspond to
the current snap to resolution. For more information about the snap to grid, see “Defining and using the Snap Grid” on page 513.

B

A. Clip handle B. Slip-edit cursor

Important: Like any clips, slip-edited clips can be combined with other clips using the Track view Clips > Bounce to Clip(s)
command and slip-edited clips in a track can be mixed down to another track. When a slip-edited clip is combined with another
clip or an effect is applied to a clip using the Process > Apply Effect > Audio Effects command, any slip-edited data (audio
clips or MIDI events that are cropped from view) is overwritten.

“Using slip-editing” on page 554

Using slip-editing
Cakewalk makes it easy to edit audio and MIDI clips by way of prominent clip handles that appear as your cursor comes close to the
edges of clips. The clip handles are easy to see and are equipped with broad functionality for fade-ins, fade-outs, and crossfades, as
well as non-destructive editing of the beginning and end of clips.

To slip-edit a clip
1. Set an appropriate snap resolution in the Control Bar’s Snap module.
2. Select the Smart tool

or Edit tool

in the Control Bar.

3. If you are slip editing an audio clip, open the Clip Properties Inspector, select the Groove Clip section and make sure the
Looping check box is unchecked.
4. Move the cursor over the beginning of the clip until the clip handle appears.

2. Select the clips you want to slip-edit.
3. Move your cursor over the beginning or end range of the selected clips until the blue clip handle appears.
4. Drag the boundary to the desired location and release.

Fades and crossfades
Fades are a gradual increase or decrease in volume at the beginning (fade-in) or end (fade-out) of a clip. A crossfade is when one
clip fades out while another fades in. There are two ways to create fades and crossfades in Cakewalk: offline (destructive) and realtime (non-destructive). To create fades and crossfades offline, see “Applying fades and crossfades offline” on page 942.
See:
“Using fades and crossfades in real-time” on page 556

Using fades and crossfades in real-time
You can create real-time fades and crossfades in the Track view’s Clips pane. Real-time fades and crossfades do not change the
data in the clip. Cakewalk reads the fade-in, fade-out, or crossfade in the clip and adjusts the gain accordingly. You can edit the
crossfade’s start time and end times. You can set the type of fade-in or fade-out you want to use as a default:

 Linear. A straight line, raising or lowering the volume at a steady rate.
 Slow Curve. A curved fade which starts to change the volume slowly at first and then rapidly increasing (fade-in) or decreasing
(fade-out) the volume.

 Fast Curve. A curved fade which starts to change the volume quickly at first and then rapidly decreasing (fade-out) or
increasing (fade-in) the volume.

To choose the fade type
Click the Track view Options menu, point to Crossfade Type and select the desired default Fade-In, Fade-Out and Crossfade curve
types.

To create a real-time fade-in in a Clip
1. Select the Smart tool

or Edit tool

in the Control Bar.

2. In the Track view’s Clips pane, move your mouse over the top part of the beginning of a clip until the cursor looks like this:
and a red line appears at the edge of the clip.

,

A filled red triangle appears at the top of the red line indicating the fade marker is ready to be dragged.

A

A. Filled red triangle

3. When your cursor changes and the filled red triangle appears, click and drag to the right until you reach your desired fade-in
length.
As you drag your mouse, a fade-in appears on your clip, and the red line moves with the mouse to mark the end of the fade-in.

The filled blue triangle at the top of the clip handle indicates that dragging the top edge of the clip handle will move the fade along
with the crop. The filled blue rectangle at the bottom of the clip handle indicates that dragging the bottom of the clip handle will
slip edit the edge, but leave the end of the fade-in where it is.

To create an automatic crossfade (real-time)
1. Click the Track view Options menu and choose Auto Crossfade.
2. Click the Track view Options menu, point to Crossfade Type > Default Crossfade Curves and select the desired default
crossfade curve types.
3. Select and drag an audio clip so that it overlaps another audio clip. You should overlap the clips by the length you want the
crossfade.
4. When you have the clip positioned where you want it, release the mouse button to drop the clip.

Tools

Cakewalk has several different global tools that allow you to edit content in your projects. The global tools live in the Tools module in
the Control Bar, and allow you to edit content in the following views:

 Track view
 Piano Roll view
 Staff view
 Tempo view
The selected tool applies to whichever editing view has focus. There are several ways to select tools:

 From the Tools module in the Control Bar. For details, see “Using the Control Bar to select tools” on page 569.
 From the Tools HUD (Heads Up Display). For details, see “Using the Tools HUD to select tools” on page 570.
 By pressing the tool’s keyboard shortcut. For details, see “Using keyboard shortcuts to select tools” on page 570.
Figure 220. Global tools are accessed from the Tools module in the Control Bar.

Each tool serves a specific purpose, and the most suitable tool depends on the editing task you want to accomplish. The default
Smart tool can be used for most tasks, but there may be times when a specific tool is either required or makes the editing task
easier. For instructions about common editing tasks, see “Using tools to perform common tasks” on page 628.
To use a tool in the Track view, first select the desired tool, then select the data type you want to edit (clips, track automation, clip
automation, audio transients, or notes). You can specify the desired data type independently for each track. For details, see
“Selecting the data type to edit” on page 572.

To temporarily invoke a tool
While using a specific tool, you can temporarily invoke another tool by holding down the new tool’s keyboard shortcut. Release the
shortcut to switch back to the previously selected tool.
For example, if you are using the Move tool and need to select some notes, press and hold down the F6 key (shortcut for the Select
tool), make a selection, then release the F6 key to return to the Move tool.
For a list of tool shortcuts, see “Using keyboard shortcuts to select tools” on page 570.

Hotspots and modifier keys
Clips, note events, envelopes and AudioSnap transients have different “hotspots”. That is, a tool may do something different
depending on where you click. As you move the mouse pointer, the current hotspot is shown as a shaded rectangle.
A modifier key, such as CTRL, ALT or SHIFT, may also be used in some cases to extend a tool’s function.
See:
“Selecting the data type to edit” on page 572

Selecting the data type to edit
Use a track’s Edit Filter control to specify the type of data you want to edit.
Figure 226. Use the Edit Filter control to specify what type of data the global tools should operate on.

A
A. Edit Filter

The following data types can be selected:

 Clips. The selected tool operates on clips.
 Audio Transients. The selected tool operates on audio transients (only available for audio tracks).
 Notes. The selected tool operates on MIDI Note events (only available for MIDI and Instrument tracks).
 Track Automation. The selected tool operates on track automation envelopes, including ProChannel, Arpeggiator, plug-in
parameters and MIDI continuous controllers (CCs). Select the desired automation parameter from the submenu. Color-coded
squares and bold text are used to indicate existing envelopes.

 Clip Automation. The selected tool operates on clip automation envelopes. Select the desired automation parameter from the
submenu. Color-coded squares and bold text are used to indicate existing envelopes.

To change the current Edit Filter setting
Do one of the following:

 Click the Edit Filter control and select the desired data type. The Edit Filter control is available in each track strip in the Track view
and in the Tools HUD (see “Using the Tools HUD to select tools” on page 570).

 Hold down the SHIFT key and click the clip or envelope you want to edit.
 Hold down the SHIFT key and right-click to toggle between the two most recently selected data types.
 Click the middle mouse button to show the Tools HUD, then scroll the mouse wheel to cycle through the available data types.
Tip: To set all tracks to the same Edit Filter setting, hold down the CTRL key when you change any non-selected track’s Edit Filter
setting. To set all selected tracks to the same Edit Filter setting, hold down the CTRL when you change any selected track’s Edit Filter
setting.

572

Tools

Tip: You can quickly toggle between Track Volume and the last/previously shown data type on the current track. To do so, press the
PLUS (+/=) key. This only works on the current parent track, not in Automation lanes.
To toggle between the two most recent Edit Filter settings, hold down the SHIFT key and right-click in the Clips pane.

Data type ghosting
Although you can only edit one data type at a time, you can choose to always show clips and automation envelopes simultaneously.
All but the selected data type will be shaded, or “ghosted”. This allows you to see all data types in context while editing a specific
data type.
You can also hold down the SHIFT key and click any ghosted object to switch a track’s current Edit Filter setting. This is a quick way
to toggle between editing clips and automation envelopes.
Figure 227. Use the Edit Filter control to specify what type of data the global tools should operate on.

To paint a pattern with the Pattern tool
1. Select the Pattern tool

2. Locate and select the pattern you want to paint.
In order to use the Pattern tool, you must first define a selection. The selection can be a clip, a portion of a clip, MIDI events in
the Piano Roll view, or a MIDI loop in the Media Browser. The most recent selection always defines the current pattern.
To select MIDI notes in the Piano Roll, drag with the right mouse button over the notes you want to select.
3. Drag from left to right in the Piano Roll view or Track view to “paint” the selected data. When painting with the Pattern tool, the
mouse pointer looks like a paint roller:

.

The location you initially click to drag defines the first note in the pattern. After the last event end time is reached, the pattern
repeats until the mouse button is released.

To transpose MIDI patterns
When painting melodic MIDI patterns in the Piano Roll view, you may want to transpose the pattern while painting. To do so, hold
down the SHIFT key while painting. The pitch you click to start the painting gesture defines the first note in the pattern. If the pattern
starts with multiple overlapping notes, the pitch you click defines the lowest note.

Tip: You don’t have to select an entire clip when painting a pattern. You can select specific notes within a clip, or, for example, all notes
of a specific pitch (click the corresponding key on the Piano Roll view keyboard). You can easily build chords or double percussion
instruments by transposing specific notes.

To save MIDI patterns to the Media Browser
If you frequently use specific MIDI patterns, save each pattern as a separate MIDI file that can be accessed from the Media Browser.
You can very quickly create your own custom library of favorite and common patterns.
1. Create a new folder on your hard disk named \My Patterns, then open the folder in Cakewalk’s Media Browser and save the
folder as a Content Location preset (see “To save a Content Location preset” on page 727).
2. In the Piano Roll view, select or draw the pattern you want to save.
3. Drag the note selection to the Media Browser.
4. Rename the MIDI file with a descriptive name, if necessary (see “To rename media files in the Media Browser” on page 726).
The MIDI pattern is saved to the Media Browser and available for future use. Simply select the saved MIDI file in the Media Browser
the next time you want to paint that specific pattern.

Snap to Grid settings
Cakewalk lets you define a snap grid that makes it easier to arrange clips, select time ranges, and control envelope shape drawing.
To use the snap grid, enable the Snap to Grid button
in the Snap module and set the grid resolution to an interval of musical
time, such as a whole note, half note, or quarter note; a unit of absolute time: a number of frames, seconds or samples; an event; the
start or end of a clip; a marker; or audio transients. The grid can use multiple resolutions at the same time, such as a whole note, and
audio transients. When the Snap to Grid button is enabled, if you move or paste clips or markers, items will be snapped to the
nearest point on the snap grid.
Figure 279. Snap to Grid settings are available in the Snap module in the Control Bar.

The Snap module contains the following settings:

 Snap enable/disable

. Enable/disable snapping.

 Snap To. Align data to the snap grid.
 Snap By. Move data by the grid resolution.
 Time resolution. Snap to the selected musical or absolute time resolution. Click and hold the mouse button pressed to select a
different duration from the pop-up menu. For absolute time resolutions (samples, frames, seconds), type the desired number of
units. When Smart Grid is selected, the snap resolution is dynamically determined by the horizontal zoom level. When Smart
Grid is enabled, the M:B:T Time Rulers in the Clips pane and Piano Roll view are optimized to show relevant snap locations.

 Triplet

. Reduces the duration of the selected Musical time resolution by 2/3 of its original duration. When Triplet is enabled,
three note events fit in the space of two.

 Dotted

. Increase the duration of the selected Musical time resolution by half of its original value (150%).

 Landmark Events

.

Snap to the selected landmarks, including markers, Now Time, clips, audio transients, MIDI notes, and

automation envelope nodes. To select the desired landmarks, right-click the Snap to Grid button
to open the Preferences
dialog, then select the desired check boxes in the Landmarks section. Cakewalk will snap to landmarks on tracks/lanes that are
currently visible in the Clips pane.

the snap grid.

 Magnetic Test. Drag the event to test the current Snap Intensity setting.
 Snap to Nearest Audio Zero Crossings. Automatically snap edited audio clips to the nearest zero crossing of the waveform
(the point at which there is no volume) to minimize glitches that can happen when waveforms are spliced together.

 Landmarks. Snap to the selected landmarks when the Events button is enabled in the Control Bar’s Snap module:
 Markers. Snap to any marker.
 Now Time. Snap to the current Now Time.

It prioritizes modules on the left of the Control Bar, trying to keep them full size, while collapsing and shrinking modules further to
the right, as necessary. Auto-sizing occurs whenever the Control Bar is resized. This is the default size setting.

 Collapsed. Collapse the module and only show the module name. Point to, or click, the collapsed module to temporarily show a
pop-up module (see “To temporarily show controls in a collapsed module” on page 651). The pop-up module is always the full
Large size. Use this size if you don’t always need to see the module’s controls, but you still want quick access to the module.
Collapsing modules helps to avoid screen clutter, and lets you focus on only the controls that are important for the task you are
working on.

 Small. Shows the minimum number of controls, or a smaller control layout.
 Medium. Shows a subset of all available controls, or a smaller control layout.

Control Bar overview

Snap module
Cakewalk lets you define a snap grid that makes it easier to arrange clips and note events, select time ranges, and control envelope
shape drawing. To use the snap grid, enable the Snap to Grid button
in the Snap module and set the grid resolution to an
interval of musical time, such as a whole note, half note, or quarter note; a unit of absolute time: a number of frames, seconds or
samples; an event; the start or end of a clip; a marker; or audio transients. The grid can use multiple resolutions at the same time,
such as a whole note, and audio transients. When the Snap to Grid button is enabled, if you move or paste clips or markers, items
will be snapped to the nearest point on the snap grid.

The Snap module contains the following settings:

 Snap enable/disable

. Enable/disable snapping.

 Time resolution. Snap to the selected musical or absolute time resolution. Click and hold the mouse button pressed to select a
different duration from the pop-up menu. For absolute time resolutions (samples, frames, seconds), type the desired number of
units. When Smart Grid is selected (the Snap to Grid button changes to
), the snap resolution is dynamically determined by
the horizontal zoom level, and the M:B:T Time Rulers in the Clips pane and Piano Roll view are optimized to show relevant snap
locations.
Note 1: To exit Smart Grid mode, clear the Smart Grid check mark. If you manually select a new resolution while Smart Grid
is enabled, the new settings only apply until the focused view's zoom level changes.

Note 2: The Piano Roll view can use its own independent snap resolution. For details, see “Piano Roll view snap resolution”
on page 840.

 Triplet

. Reduces the duration of the selected Musical time resolution by 2/3 of its original duration. When Triplet is enabled,
three note events fit in the space of two.

 Dotted

. Increase the duration of the selected Musical time resolution by half of its original value (150%).

The Transport module contains the following controls:

 Rewind

.

Gradually rewind the project.

 Stop

. Stop playback.

 Play

. Start/stop playback.

 Pause

. Pause/resume playback.

 Fast Forward

. Gradually fast forward the project.

 Record

. Start recording (requires at least one track to be armed for recording). Right-click to access global record options.
Click and keep the mouse button pressed for a brief moment to choose the desired record mode and how new Take lanes are
created during recording. The Record button indicates the current record mode (for details, see “Recording modes” on page 352):

 Comping

. When recording, previously recorded material on the track is not heard. When a recording is done, the newly
recorded material is heard and all other takes are time-muted for the duration of the new material.

Comp record mode will record all takes as independent Take lanes. At the end of a recording pass, only the most recently
recorded takes will be audible. This is achieved by automatically comping, isolating the clips in the recording and muting other
clips in existing Take lanes.
Splits are created in all lanes at the start and end record times.

Control Bar overview

663

All clips within the recorded region are automatically "healed", removing any unnecessary splits from prior takes.
All clips in Take lanes that are obscured by the latest record pass are muted.
The comp splitting process follows the same logic as the Comping tool, and will mute all clips that are not part of the latest
recording.

 Overwrite

. The new material replaces (overwrites) any existing material. This means that portions of existing clips may
be “wiped clean” to make room for newly recorded material. While recording, you will not be able to hear material from existing
clips.

 Sound on Sound

. The new material is merged with any existing material. This means that any existing clips on the
track are left unchanged and all newly recorded material is stored in new clips. While recording, you will be able to hear
material from existing clips. Note: When loop recording, you will not be able to hear the prior loop passes until you stop
recording. This is because takes are only committed after recording is stopped.

 Step Record

. Open the Step Record window. For details, see “Step recording” on page 373.

 Takes Create New Lane. Always create a new lane for each take.
 Takes Reuse Existing Lane. Reuse existing lanes for each take (this option is not available when using the Comping
record mode).

 Takes Reuse Existing Lane, Unless Takes Overlap. Reuse existing lanes for each take, and only create new lanes if
takes overlap.

 Go to Start (RTZ)

.

Rewind to the start of the project.

 Progress Bar

.

Current position in the project. Drag to skip around in the project.

 Go to End

. Skip to the end of the project.

 Time Display. The time display section shows useful information about the current project, including the Now time, sample rate
and bit depth, tempo and meter. The following information is shown:

 Current Now Time. The Now time shows your current location in the project. For details, see “The Now time and how to use
it” on page 282. Click the time display to toggle between the following time formats:
• MBT. Display time as Measure:Beat:Tick.
• HMSF. Display time as Hour:Minute:Second:Frame. This format is also referred to as SMPTE time.
• Milliseconds. Display time in milliseconds.

 Dropout Indicator

. Appears whenever the audio engine is stopped as a result of a dropout. For details, see “Dropouts
and other audio problems” on page 1373.

 Audio Engine on/off

. Enable/disable the audio engine. The Audio Engine button lights up if the audio engine stops
running. To restart the audio engine, click the Audio Engine button.

 Reset / Panic (Reset MIDI and Audio)

. Reset any stuck MIDI notes. The Reset button flashes if a MIDI note is stuck. To
force a restart of the audio and MIDI engine (only if the transport is not playing/recording), including a reset of ASIO, hold
down the CTRL key and click the Reset button.

 Sample Rate / Bit Depth. The project’s sample rate and recording bit depth.
 Current Tempo. The current tempo at the Now time. Double-click to change the current tempo.
 Current Meter. The number of beats per measure and the note value of each beat at the current Now time. Click to change

The Performance module contains the following controls:

 CPU meters. The CPU meters let you monitor your computer’s CPU activity. Right-click the CPU meters to specify the global
CPU meter mode:

 Audio Processing. Measures Cakewalk’s audio processing load, which is the time it takes to process a buffer full of audio
data as a percentage of the maximum time available to process that data and maintain uninterrupted playback. There is one
CPU meter for each core in your computer, up to 32 cores. There is some tolerance built into the meter, so it is possible that it
will exceed 100% at times (more so during recording than playback).

 System Performance. Displays the global system-wide load across all cores, as reported by the operating system rather
than by measuring Cakewalk’s audio processing load.

 Overall App Performance. Displays a single CPU meter for the entire Cakewalk process CPU utilization across all cores.
Note: The width of the Performance module depends on the number of CPU cores available.

32 cores

4 cores

 Disk Activity indicator

. Measures how much of the available time Cakewalk is using to perform input/output functions on
your hard disk. The size of your setup’s I/O buffer size (listed under File System in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Sync and
Caching) determines how much time is allowed to perform disk operations and maintain uninterrupted playback. When Cakewalk
performs disk operations, the Disk Activity indicator changes color from yellow to red to indicate the time Cakewalk is taking to
complete each cycle of disk input/output. A red icon indicates very high data activity.

 Disk Space meter. Shows the amount of available space on the drive where your wave data directory is located. The tooltip
shows the actual remaining disk space on your audio disk.

 Memory Usage (RAM) meter. Shows the total memory (RAM) usage by your computer, not just by Cakewalk.
Note: If you experience a dropout or your CPU or Disk meters are reading high, there are steps you can take to improve your
audio performance. For more information, see “Audio dropouts or crashes during playback” on page 1432.

Control Bar overview

CPU metrics
Diagnosing glitches in audio playback is easy with the Engine Load and Late Buffers metrics in the Performance module tooltip. To
view these new metrics, hover the mouse over the Performance module. Note: you must have Show Tooltips enabled in
Preferences > Customization - Display to see this.
The Engine Load value is a percentage of the total time the engine took to process an audio buffer. If it takes 100% or more of the
allotted time, the buffer is processed too late and it will result in audio glitches/distortion. The value in parenthesis represents the
max engine load since the time the engine started.
Engine load is a better metric to help troubleshoot audio glitches during playback since it accounts for other delays in synchronizing
and processing audio workloads beyond what the CPU meters report. It's normal for engine load to be higher than the average CPU
meter value shown.
The Late Buffers count indicates the total number of buffers that took too long to process since the time the engine started. Too
many late buffers will result in audible glitches or distortion in playback due to the audio device not receiving buffers in time.

Note: It's OK to have a few sporadic late buffers during playback since it will not result in audible glitches.

when synchronizing to any European video format.

 29.97 FPS Drop. NTSC broadcast and long format video in North America and Japan. This setting synchronizes the video
perfectly with Cakewalk, but the sequencer position displayed in the Now Time and Big Time displays will gradually drift and
become incorrect over long periods of time. The audio and MIDI synchronization to the external device will not be affected by
this discrepancy.

 29.97 FPS Non Drop. NTSC non-broadcast and short length video in North America and Japan. Used for some music
projects. This setting synchronizes the video perfectly with Cakewalk, but the sequencer position displayed in the Now Time
and Big Time displays will gradually drift and become incorrect over long periods of time. The audio and MIDI synchronization
to the external device will not be affected by this discrepancy.

 30 FPS Drop. Not a standard type of timecode, used rarely for speed correction and transfer problems in tape based
systems.

 30 FPS Non Drop. Most music projects and some film in North America. This is the best choice for any music project and
should be used unless the situation dictates otherwise.

 Incoming timecode. Shows the current time of incoming time code when synchronizing to an external device.

684

Control Bar overview

 Sync type. Select the sync type. The following sync types are supported:
 Internal Sync
 MIDI Sync

.

Timing is determined by the clock on the computer motherboard.

. Timing is determined by the clock on an external MIDI device.

 SMPTE/MTC Sync

. Timing is determined by a time code signal (in SMPTE or some other format) recorded on some
external medium or generated and sent by Cakewalk.

 Audio Sync

. Timing is determined by the clock on the computer’s audio interface.

 Transmit MIDI Sync

. Transmit MIDI Sync to external MIDI devices, such as drum machines, stand-alone MIDI hardware
sequencers, and sequencers built into MIDI keyboards (only available when using the Internal or Audio clock). Cakewalk sends
messages to all other devices to start and stop playback and to keep all the devices in sync. Cakewalk can send MIDI Sync on
multiple MIDI output ports. For details, see “MIDI synchronization” on page 1339.

 Transmit MTC Sync

. Transmit MIDI Time Code (MTC) to external devices that can receive MTC. SMPTE/MTC is a
position and timing reference that indicates the current location in the project and how quickly the project should be playing.
SMPTE/MTC time code labels the position in a project in hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. The speed of playback is
indicated by a frame rate. Cakewalk can send MTC on multiple output ports simultaneously. For details, see “SMPTE/MIDI time
code synchronization” on page 1342.

Inspectors

When working on a project, you will frequently need to access track and clip parameters and mix controls. The Track Inspector and
Properties Inspector provide easy access to relevant settings for the selected track(s) or clip(s).
Figure 325. Use the Track Inspector and Properties Inspector to configure track and clip settings.

B

A. Properties Inspector B. Track Inspector

The Inspector pane appears to the left of the Track view, but can also be moved to the right side. There are five separate inspectors:

 Arranger Inspector. The Arranger Inspector shows all the arranger sections defined in the project’s timeline, and allows you to
create unlimited different arrangements of the current project. Each arrangement can contain any combination of sections, in any
order. For details, see “Arranger tracks” on page 438.

 Tempo Inspector. The Tempo Inspector shows a list of all tempo envelope nodes and allows you to edit each tempo change
BPM, time position, and curve type. For details, see “Tempo Inspector” on page 398 and “Using the Tempo Inspector” on page
413.

 Track Inspector. The Track Inspector shows mix settings for the current track, bus, or hardware output, and is essentially
identical to a channel strip in the Console view. Advanced MIDI settings are also available for MIDI tracks and Instrument tracks.
For details, see “Track Inspector overview” on page 695.

 Properties Inspector. The Properties Inspector shows properties for the selected clip(s), track(s), or bus(es). For details, see
“Properties Inspector overview” on page 707. The Properties Inspector has several modes:

 Clip. The Clip Properties Inspector displays settings for the currently selected clip(s). For details, see “Properties Inspector Clip Properties” on page 708.

 Track. The Track Properties Inspector lets you type a track name, specify the automation write mode and time base, specify
an audio track’s stretch methods, specify the default clip colors, and enter a text description. For details, see “Properties
Inspector - Track Properties” on page 713.

 Bus. The Bus Properties Inspector lets you type a bus name, specify the automation write mode and time base, and enter a
text description. For details, see “Properties Inspector - Bus Properties” on page 715.
Note: Settings in the inspectors are non-destructive, and therefore do not destructively process data in any way. Feel free to
experiment with different settings without worrying that changes are permanent.

 ProChannel. ProChannel combines compression, equalization, and tube saturation modeling in one convenient processor.
ProChannel is available on each audio track, Instrument track and bus. For details, see “ProChannel” on page 1081.
Note: Due to technical limitations of the VST plug-in format, it is not possible to show more than one instance of a ProChannel
module. As a result, the same ProChannel instance can not be displayed in the Inspector and Console view at the same time.
If you open ProChannel in the Inspector, the same ProChannel will close in the Console view, and vice versa.

Track Inspector overview
The Track Inspector provides mixing controls for the currently selected audio track, MIDI track, Instrument track, bus or hardware
output. The Track Inspector is essentially identical to a channel strip in the Console view. Any changes you make in the Track
Inspector are reflected in the corresponding Console view channel strip, and vice versa. The Track Inspector modules can be
shown/hidden independently from the corresponding Console view modules.
The Track Inspector is divided in two. The left strip shows mix controls for the current track/bus/hardware output. The right strip
varies depending on the current track type, as shown in the following table.

 Snap to Scale On/Off. Enables/disables Snap to Scale on the selected track.
 Scale. Displays current scale for Snap to Scale feature. The drop-down menu contains the following options:
 <scale categories>. The pre-installed scales are organized into categories such as Diatonic, Pentatonic, Exotic, etc. Point
to the desired category and select a scale from the submenu.

 Custom User Scales. This submenu lists all custom scales you have created.
 Scale Manager. Select Scale Manager to create new scales or edit existing scales. See “To create a scale” on page 879
and “To edit or delete a scale” on page 880.

 Root Note. Use this field to specify the root note of the selected scale.
 Settings. Use this field to specify how you want Cakewalk to handle non-scale notes in the Piano Roll view when Snap to Scale
is enabled.

 Next, Higher Note. Cakewalk moves any non-scale note that you move to the next higher note in the selected scale.
 Previous, Lower Note. Cakewalk moves any non-scale note that you move to the previous, lower note in the selected
scale.

 Nearest Note. Cakewalk moves any non-scale note that you move to the note that is closest in pitch in the selected scale.
For more information about Snap to Scale, see “Snap to Scale” on page 878.

Input Quantize section
 Input Quantize On/Off. Enables/disables Input Quantize on the selected track.
 Preset. Save or select settings that you use often in the drop-down menu. To save a new group of settings, click the Preset list
and choose Quantize Settings to open the Input Quantize dialog box, then type a name in the Preset field and click the Save
button. To delete a group, select it and click the Delete button. The Input Quantize dialog box contains the following settings:

 Resolution. Set the note resolution in either standard note duration or tick value. The resolution determines the size note or
time value that you want your MIDI data to conform to.

 MIDI Event Start Times. Select this option to quantize MIDI event start times.
 Note Durations. Select this option to quantize Note Event durations to the size of the Resolution value.
 Only Quantize Notes. If selected, Cakewalk will not modify other events, such as controllers.
 Strength. This value determines how closely Cakewalk moves the selected notes to the resolution value, or “grid”. See
“Strength” on page 871.

 Swing. Use this value to make groups of even eighth notes (or whatever note you want to enter in the Resolution field)
“swing”, instead of playing with exact eighth note rhythm. A value of 50 percent, or “50-50”, produces equal durations for both
notes—no swing. A larger value makes the first note longer, and vice versa. See “Swing” on page 871.

 Window. This value determines whether Cakewalk quantizes notes that are far from the quantization points, or leaves them
alone. A value of 100 percent quantizes every note. See “Window” on page 872.

 Randomize. This value randomizes the three previous fields to introduce a more human feel to the rhythm. The value you
enter is the maximum amount of difference from the entered values that the randomize feature can add.
For more information about Input Quantize, see “Input quantizing” on page 357.

Arpeggiator section
 Arpeggiator On/Off. Enables/disables the Arpeggiator on the selected track. This control can be assigned to MIDI remote
control and modified in real-time during project playback.

 Preset. You can create and edit Arpeggiator presets; all user parameters are stored in the preset. Arpeggiator settings are
included in track templates.

 Rate. Adjusts the relative speed of the Arpeggiator sequence by changing all the note durations by a factor of the current tempo.
This control can be assigned to MIDI remote control and modified in real-time during project playback.

 Lock Rate. Lock the current arpeggiator Rate value, thereby preventing the Rate value from changing when you select other
arpeggiator presets.

 Octave Range. Sets the number of octaves through which the arpeggio will play. A value of 1 means that a held chord will only
arpeggiate the notes that are being held within the octave from which the notes are being transmitted. A value of 2 means a held
chord will arpeggiate for two octaves. The held chord always represents the bass octave, meaning that the other octaves sound in
a higher register.
If you specify a range higher than the standard MIDI specifications, the Arpeggiator will repeat the pattern in the highest available
octave as necessary.
This control can be assigned to MIDI remote control and modified in real-time during project playback.

 Latch. Latch keeps the arpeggio playing after you let go of the keys.
This control can be assigned to MIDI remote control and modified in real-time during project playback.

 Swing. Sets the amount of swing applied to the selected pattern. You can make a pattern of 8th, 16th, or 32nd notes play back
as swing notes instead of straight notes. The amount of swing ranges from 0 (no swing) to 100% (maximum swing).

 Velocity. An offset control that scales the arpeggiated note’s velocity to a percentage of the original note velocity.
 Duration. Controls whether the notes in the pattern are held to their full value, or are held for shorter or longer durations.
 Pitch. A transposition control in half-steps, up or down a maximum of 2 octaves.
Flam. If a pattern contains flams, this menu controls how big a difference there is between the attack time of the flam and the
note it is attached to.

 Mix. When 0, simultaneously held notes arpeggiate as single notes. At 50%, simultaneously held notes are heard as a chord in
addition to the usual arpeggiated notes, both at equal levels. At 100%, only the held chord is audible.
Control: Knob (0 – 100%); this control can be assigned to MIDI remote control and modified in real-time during project playback.

The section expands and the previously-displayed section collapses.
Figure 339. Click a section’s header bar to expand the section and show its controls.

Properties section
 Properties header bar. Click to show/hide the Properties section.
 Clip Name. Use this field to assign a name to the selected clip. The name of a clip is used in the Track view and Event List view.
You can assign any name to help you remember the contents of the clip.

 Time Format. Use the list to specify in which format to display the selected clip’s Start time and Length. The options are as
follows:

 MBT. Display the clip’s Start and Length properties in M:B:T (Measure:Beat:Tick) format.
 Samples. Display the clip’s Start and Length properties in number of samples format.
 HMSF. Display the clip’s Start and Length properties in H:M:S:F (Hour: Minute:Second:Frame) format.
 Seconds. Display the clip’s Start and Length properties in number of seconds format.
 Start. Use this field to move the selected clip forward or backward in the track by setting a new start time.
 Length. This field displays the length of the selected clip.
 Snap Offset (audio clips only). The Snap Offset field is for audio clips only. Snap offsets allow you to set a point other than
the beginning of a clip as the “snap” point used by the Snap to Grid. A snap offset is the number of samples from the beginning of
the clip. Snap offsets affect all edits that obey the Snap to Grid setting. Clips without a snap offset always align at the very
beginning of a clip. For more information, see “Snap offsets” on page 515.
Note: You cannot set a snap offset for a Groove clip.

 Original Time. The Original Time property stores and shows the original SMPTE time stamp associated with the clip. This is the
SMPTE time stamp at which the clip was recorded or imported into the project. The Original Time property can not be edited. See
“To revert clip(s) to original time stamp” on page 503.

 Time Base. Choose one of the two options in this section to control what happens to a locked clip when you change the tempo:
 Musical (M:B:T). If the clip is set to the Musical time base, the clip’s M:B:T position stays constant, and its absolute position
shifts.

 Absolute. If the clip is set to the Absolute time base, its absolute position stays constant, and its M:B:T position shifts.

Inspectors
Properties Inspector overview

709

 Mute. Mutes the clip.
 Lock. Locks the clip’s data and/or position. The Lock drop-down menu contains the following options:
 Position and Data. Locks position and data, and adds a lock icon on the clip .
 Position Only. Locks position only, and adds a yellow lock icon (with the clasp unlocked) on the clip .
 Data Only. Locks data only, and adds a blue lock icon (with the clasp unlocked) on the clip .
 Automation Read. Allows the clip to respond to clip automation envelopes.
Note: Clip envelopes are only visible/editable when the parent track’s Edit Filter control is set to Clip Automation. For details,
see “Selecting the data type to edit” on page 572.

 Clips Linked. Shows how many clips are linked to the selected clip.
 Foreground. Specifies the waveform or note color of the selected clip.
 Background. Specifies the clip background color of the selected clip.
 Use Track Colors. Returns the selected clip’s color to the default, as defined in Edit > Preferences > Customization - Color.
For more information about clip properties, see “Editing clip properties” on page 933 and “Arranging clips” on page 489.

Groove Clip section
 Groove Clip header bar. Click to show/hide the Groove Clip section.
 Looping. Convert the selected clip to a Groove Clip. You can drag the right edge of a Groove Clip to create loop repetitions.
Groove Clips can also obey pitch markers. For more information about Groove Clips, see “Working with Groove Clip audio” on
page 806 and “MIDI Groove Clips” on page 813.
Note: If this control is not available, the selected clip is most likely an AudioSnap clip. A clip can not have Groove Clip looping
and AudioSnap enabled at the same time.

 Stretch to Tempo (audio clips only). Stretch or shrink the selected clip to fit the project’s tempo. Cakewalk uses the Beats in
Clip and Original Tempo parameters to make the change.

 Beats in Clips. The number of beats (quarter notes) in the clip.
 Original Tempo (audio clips only). The tempo at which the clip was recorded.
 Follow Pitch. Transposes the loop, if necessary, to the key of the project. A loop recorded in the key of A, used in a project in
the key of C, will be transposed up three semitones if the Follow Pitch option is selected. You can also insert markers in the Time
Ruler which change the project pitch. These markers, called pitch markers affect only Groove clips with Follow Pitch enabled.

 Reference Note. Represents the key in which the loop was originally recorded. The Follow Pitch feature uses this information,
when checked, to transpose the loop to match the project’s default project pitch and pitch markers.

 Pitch (semitones). Allows you to set the transposition of a clip independently from the project pitch. A positive number
transposes the clip up by that number of semitones. A negative number transposes the clip down by that number of semitones.
Remember, if Follow Pitch is enabled, the clip follows the project’s pitch, so any transposition changes you make using this
option are changes to the project pitch, not the clip pitch.

 Fine Pitch (cents). Allows you to make tuning adjustments or to transpose the pitch of a clip up to 50 cents. There are 100
cents in one semitone. A Fine Pitch setting of 1 adjusts the pitch up one hundredth of a semitone. The Fine Pitch option can “fine
tune” a slightly out of tune clip so that it is in pitch with the remaining clips in a project.
For more information about Groove Clips, see “Working with loops and Groove Clips” on page 799.

Properties Inspector overview

AudioSnap section
 AudioSnap header bar. Click to show/hide the AudioSnap section.
 Enable. Enables or disables AudioSnap on selected audio clips.
Note: AudioSnap is automatically enabled on a clip if you stretch a transient marker on the clip.

 Average Tempo. Shows the average tempo candidates: original, 0.5x and 2x. Cakewalk will do its best to detect the correct
average tempo, but a clip can often have multiple potential tempos (60 BPM, 120 BPM, 240 BPM, etc.). If Cakewalk is unable to
detect a tempo, Average Tempo will be set to Original, which is the project’s tempo at the location the clip was recorded or
imported. If you change the Average Tempo setting, all clip tempo changes are adjusted to scale.

 Follow Project Tempo. Forces the clip to follow the project’s global tempo map.
 Follow Options. Specifies at which resolution the clip should follow tempo changes when Follow Project Tempo is selected.
The options are as follows:

 Beats
 Measures
 Clip (default)
 Auto-Stretch
Note: The Follow Project Tempo option only works on clips that are configured to use musical time (the Time Base property
is set to Musical (M:B:T) in the Clip Properties Inspector.

 Filter Threshold. Disables AudioSnap transient markers based on their volume. This clears out unwanted markers to make
editing easier. Higher values create a bigger volume threshold, which disables markers that are fall below that threshold.

 Filter Resolution. The selected Filter Resolution value lets you disable markers based on their time location. This clears out
unwanted markers to make editing easier. Larger values create a bigger time window, based on musical time values, which
preserves markers that are closest to the displayed musical time value, and disables others.

 Online Render. This choice determines what stretch algorithm is used during real-time playback. For more information about
render modes, see “Algorithms and rendering” on page 795. The options are as follows:

 Default. This uses the default algorithm listed in the default Online Render field in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback
and Recording.

 Groove. This mode works faster than Percussion render mode, using less processing power.
 Percussion. This mode works better than the Groove render mode on percussive material, especially if the stretching is by
more than a few beats per minute.

 Elastique Pro. Elastique Pro is a general purpose high quality time-stretching engine that fulfills the demands of
professional productions and broadcast applications. It minimizes stretching artifacts, offers stable timing, inter-channel phase
coherence and sample accurate stretching which allows for sharp transients and crystal clear vocals.

 Elastique Efficient. Elastique Efficient gives you similar time-stretching quality as Elastique Pro, but with a lower CPU hit.
The algorithm is targeted at complex polyphonic signals like complete mixes and offers the same transient preservation as
Elastique Pro.
Note: The Online render mode is for preview purposes only during playback. The final audio quality will be greatly improved
after the Offline render mode is applied during mixdown/export.

 Radius Mix. Better for clips containing polyphonic, stereo data.
 Radius Mix Advanced. Similar to Radius Mix, but exposes Radius Pitch Coherence and Radius Phase Coherence
sliders in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording.

 Radius Solo. Better for clips containing monophonic, solo instruments.
 Radius Solo (Bass). Better for clips containing solo bass instruments.
 Radius Solo (Vocal). Better for clips containing solo vocals.
 Elastique Pro. Elastique Pro is a general purpose high quality time-stretching engine that fulfills the demands of
professional productions and broadcast applications. It minimizes stretching artifacts, offers stable timing, inter-channel phase
coherence and sample accurate stretching which allows for sharp transients and crystal clear vocals.

Using FX Chain presets (.fxc)
You can save effect chains in Cakewalk, which can be used in any project. An FX Chain preset stores all the settings of a specific FX
Rack. This allows you to effortlessly duplicate favorite effect combinations and settings without having to manually insert one effect
at a time. FX Chain presets are saved as .fxc files that can be imported from the Plug-in Browser.

To save an FX Chain preset
1. Do one of the following:

 To save an FX Rack as an FX Chain preset, right-click any blank space in the FX Rack and choose Save Rack as FX Chain
Preset on the pop-up menu. Specify a preset name and location in the Save FX Chain Preset dialog box. All plug-ins in the
FX Rack are consolidated into a single new FX Chain.

 To save an FX Chain container as a new FX Chain preset, right-click the FX Chain container in an FX Rack and choose Save
Rack as FX Chain Preset on the pop-up menu. Specify a preset name and location in the Save FX Chain Preset dialog box.

 Click the Browse Plug-ins button

in the Browser, then drag the FX Chain container from the Track view to the Audio FX
section in the Browser. The FX Chain is added to the FX Chain folder.

Note: FX Chain presets are stored as FX Chain Preset files (*.fxc). For track and bus FX Racks, the default name for the FX
Chain preset is the track/bus name. For clip FX Racks, the default name is the clip name.

To load an FX Chain preset
Do one of the following:

 Right-click an FX Rack and choose Load FX Chain Preset on the pop-up menu. Select the desired FX Chain Preset file (*.fxc) in
the Load FX Chain Preset dialog box and click Open.

 From the PlugIns tab of the Browser, under Audio FX, expand the FX Chain branch and drag the preset to an FX Rack.
Note: You can automatically extract plug-ins when loading an FX Chain preset. To do so, hold down the SHIFT key while
loading the preset. For more information about extracting plug-ins from an FX Chain container, see “To extract plug-ins from an
FX Chain container” on page 1030.

Caution: If you load a Cakewalk project in an older version of SONAR, SONAR will report the FX Chain as a missing plug-in
and the contents of the FX Chain will be unavailable. Resaving the project will permanently remove the FX Chain.

To rename an FX Chain preset
1. In the Browser, click the PlugIns button

to show the Plug-in Browser.

Using the Synth Rack

Note: The core Cakewalk installer does not include all available software instruments. Please download and install the optional
instruments via BandLab Assistant (see “BandLab Assistant” on page 276).
The Synth Rack view lets you view, insert, delete, and configure your soft synths. You can also mute, solo, and freeze any active
instruments in your projects. Each time you insert a soft synth into your project, a new row appears in the Synth Rack view with the
name of the soft synth and its current preset. You can select different presets directly from the Synth Rack.
When a synth is highlighted in the Synth Rack, the corresponding tracks in the Track View and Console View are also highlighted.
You can insert as many copies of the same soft synth as you like; each new copy appears in a new row and has the same name, but
has a higher number after the name (ReWire soft synths can only have one copy open). The new higher-numbered name also
appears on the menus of Instrument track inputs and MIDI track outputs.
When the Synth Rack is undocked, or docked in the MultiDock, additional controls become available. These include synth icons and
control knobs to control and/or automate parameters.

Workspaces

A Workspace is a global template that stores the current UI configuration. and allow you to instantly adapt Cakewalk’s UI to only
show elements that are relevant to a specific task or workflow. You can hide features you don’t want to see. Some workflows require
access to many features, while other workflows benefit from a simpler and more focused UI. The selected Workspace remains active
until you select another Workspace or disable Workspaces, and is applied to all projects.
Cakewalk includes several factory Workspaces to get you started, and you can create your own custom Workspaces based on your
personal preferences. Simply customize Cakewalk’s look and feel to suit your workflow, then save the configuration as a Workspace
that can be recalled at any time. Be more productive and efficient by optimizing the UI for simplicity and speed.

Note: Factory Workspaces are always overwritten when installing a new Cakewalk release. If you need to customize a factory
Workspace, please save your Workspace as a new name to prevent it from getting overwritten by a future Cakewalk release.

AudioSnap

Cakewalk’s AudioSnap engine and tempo analysis features give you unprecedented rhythmic and tempo control over your audio.
Employing sophisticated transient detection technology, the AudioSnap engine automatically analyzes all recorded and imported
audio files for rhythmic content to determine where the beats are in the music.
AudioSnap is completely non-destructive, similar to Groove clips and V-Vocal clips. AudioSnap, V-Vocal, and Groove clips are
mutually exclusive. Groove clip markers are typically placed at a zero-crossing point before a transient; AudioSnap transient
markers are placed where musical changes occur, but may not be exactly at a zero crossing.

What is AudioSnap?
AudioSnap is not a single feature, but rather a collection of different tools that can be used for different tasks. The AudioSnap palette
ties it all together in a task-oriented layout.
AudioSnap does several things, in a variety of ways:

 Stretches audio clips to fit project tempo or for quantizing.
 Changes project tempo to fit audio or MIDI clips.
 Copies audio rhythms for groove quantizing or doubling sounds.
Figure 355. The AudioSnap palette.

How does it work?
AudioSnap works by finding the transients in audio clips. Transients are the areas in an audio clip where the level increases
suddenly. These make good locations to shrink, stretch, or split a clip, without changing its sound quality too drastically. Cakewalk
contains a variety of high-quality stretching algorithms for different kinds of material. You can choose a lower-quality algorithm for
real-time playback of your edits, and then choose a better algorithm for mixdown or bouncing to track (see “Algorithms and
rendering” on page 795).
Cakewalk lets you define the default online and offline algorithms via the AudioSnap palette, and you can override the default
algorithm(s) on a clip-by-clip basis.
Note: The online algorithm is for preview purposes only during playback. The final audio quality will be greatly improved after
the offline algorithm is applied during mixdown/export.

AudioSnap

751

The transients also make it possible for Cakewalk to calculate a clip’s tempo map (see “Editing a clip’s tempo map” on page 771).
Figure 356. Audio clip.

Figure 357. Audio clip showing transient markers.

AudioSnap finds transients automatically, but the transient markers don’t always appear exactly where you might want them for the
kind of editing you want to do. You can edit the markers by moving them to new locations, adding markers, filtering out markers,
deleting markers, and promoting markers (protecting them from being filtered). For information about editing transient markers, see
“Editing transient markers” on page 757.

Why would I use it?
Here are some common uses for AudioSnap:

 Aligning measure lines and tempo to audio or MIDI tracks that were recorded without a metronome (see “Synchronizing audio
and the project tempo” on page 769).

 Fixing timing errors (see “Fixing timing problems in audio clips” on page 774).
 Synchronizing the rhythms of out-of-sync tracks (see “Making multiple clips/tracks groove together” on page 779).
 Doubling existing sounds with other sounds (see “Extracting MIDI timing information from audio” on page 786).
 Changing the tempo of existing projects (see “Changing a project’s tempo” on page 773).
 Snapping both audio and MIDI edits to audio beats (see “Snapping edits to audio beats” on page 787).
 Fixing timing errors in multi-track recordings while maintaining phase relationships (see “Adjusting the timing of a multi-track
performance while maintaining phase relationships” on page 776).
If you want to edit audio right away with AudioSnap, see “Synchronizing audio and the project tempo” on page 769 and “Fixing timing
problems in audio clips” on page 774. If you want to learn more about all the AudioSnap tools and options, see the following links.

AudioSnap transient detection algorithms
The AudioSnap transient detection method can be specified in Edit > Preferences > Project - AudioSnap under Transient
Detection. There are three methods:

 Magnitude
 Spectral (default for legacy projects)
 Multi-Resolution (default for new projects)
Multi-Resolution is the default transient detection method for new projects, and Spectral and Magnitude are the older legacy
modes. The Multi-Resolution transient detection algorithm provides improved transient analysis that works well with most audio
source material.
The detection mode is stored in the project and older projects will continue to use Spectral until changed via Edit > Preferences >
Project - AudioSnap.

Note: The Multi-Resolution transient analysis will not be used by default on pre-Cakewalk 2021.09 saved projects. You must
explicitly pick the Multi-Resolution algorithm from Edit > Preferences > Project - AudioSnap before this will take effect for
that project. Once you resave the project with this change it will continue to use the new algorithm for all audio.

752

AudioSnap

When the detection method is changed, you will be prompted that project audio waveforms will be recomputed. After regeneration of
the waveforms are complete, the new transients will be visible when switching the edit filter to Transients. The default transient
threshold (available in the AudioSnap palette) is different for each transient detector mode. Note that any edited transients are
retained when switching the transient detector mode.

Using global tools on AudioSnap transient markers
At the heart of AudioSnap are transient markers. Cakewalk automatically detects transients for all audio clips in your project.
Although you can also edit transient markers with the Select tool, Move tool, Stretch tool, Split tool, Freehand tool, Erase tool and
Mute tool, this chapter focuses on the Smart tool since it is the easiest way to edit transient markers.
In order to edit audio transient markers, you must assign a track’s Edit Filter to Audio Transients (see “Selecting the data type to
edit” on page 572).
For more information about using different tools on AudioSnap transient markers, see:
“Using the Smart tool on AudioSnap transients” on page 583
“Using the Select tool on AudioSnap transients” on page 587
“Using the Move tool on AudioSnap transients” on page 590

“Using the Freehand tool on AudioSnap transients” on page 604
“Using the Erase tool on AudioSnap transients” on page 616
“Using the Mute tool on AudioSnap transients” on page 619

To enable the Smart tool
1. Select the Smart tool

in the Control Bar.

2. Assign the desired track’s Edit Filter control to Audio Transients.
All audio clips show transient markers and the AudioSnap palette appears.
Note: Displaying transient markers does not mean that AudioSnap is enabled. AudioSnap is only active on a clip when at least
one transient marker has been stretched.
If you select another data type in the Edit Filter, transient markers will no longer be visible and the AudioSnap palette closes.
The following table describes how the Smart tool behaves when interacting with transient markers and clips.

Transient marker context menu
The transient marker context menu gives you quick access to commands related to time stretching and tempo mapping. The
following menu commands are available when you right-click a transient marker:

 Select markers. Use this submenu to select transient markers that meet specific criteria.
 Set project tempo from clip. This command copies the clip’s tempo map to the project’s global tempo map. This allows the
project’s measure boundaries to align with the audio clip. Whenever the project’s tempo map is generated from a clip, the clip’s
Lock Position property is enabled automatically.

 Set clip tempo from project. This command copies the project’s tempo map to the clip’s tempo map. This allows the project’s
measure boundaries to align with the audio clip.

 Clip follows project tempo. This command forces the clip to follow the project’s global tempo map.
Note: The Clip follows project tempo command only works on clips that are configured to use musical time (the Time Base
property is set to Musical in the Clip Properties Inspector).

 Edit clip tempo map. Each audio clip has an internal tempo map. This command exposes controls that allow you to edit a clip’s
tempo map. For details, see “Editing a clip’s tempo map” on page 771.

AudioSnap
Using global tools on AudioSnap transient markers

755

 Merge and Lock Markers. This command combines all transient markers on all selected tracks, so that all selected tracks
share identical transient markers. The clip positions are also locked. This will ensure that phase relationships are maintained
when quantizing or moving clips across multiple tracks. When using the Smart tool to drag transient markers, all transient markers
at exactly the same point in time on selected clips move together as a group.

 Save as Groove. This command opens the Define Groove dialog box, which lets you save the groove to a file. The groove can
then be applied to other audio or MIDI clips.

 Copy as MIDI. This command saves the selected audio as a MIDI clip, which you can paste from the Clipboard into a MIDI
track. You select the MIDI note that the transients in the audio clip will be converted to in the AudioSnap Options dialog box,
which opens when you click the Options button.

 Quantize. This command opens the Quantize dialog box, which has options to quantize AudioSnap Beats and Audio Clip
Start Times, and also to set automatic crossfade options.

 Groove Quantize. This command opens the Groove Quantize dialog box, which has an option to quantize AudioSnap Beats,
and controls to set automatic crossfade options.

 Pool > Add MBT to pool. The Track view Time Ruler can be added to the Pool (see “Using the Pool” on page 793). This
command adds the current Musical Time snap resolution to the pool, and also displays dotted pool lines in the Clips pane. This
can be useful as either a basic visual guide, or for adding the Musical Time to an extracted groove, or to fill in any transients that
may be “missing” in a syncopated or sparse section. In the Control Bar’s Snap module, set the Musical Time value to the

Using global tools on AudioSnap transient markers

Editing transient markers
Transient markers show where the transients of a clip are (areas where the level increases suddenly), and are used to edit the timing
of audio clips.
AudioSnap finds transients automatically, but the transient markers don’t always appear exactly where you might want them for the
kind of editing you want to do.
Most AudioSnap commands edit transient markers automatically as a result of an editing operation, but sometimes you achieve the
best results by editing the markers manually.
You can edit the markers by moving them to new locations, adding markers, filtering out markers, deleting markers, and promoting
markers (protecting them from being filtered).
Figure 360. Transient markers.

The waveform of stretched segments are colored blue, and the waveform of compressed segments are colored red. The color gets
progressively darker the more a segment is stretched or compressed:

 Dark blue = slightly stretched.
 Light blue = heavily stretched.
 Dark red = slightly compressed.
 Light red = heavily compressed.

To enable/disable transient markers
It’s sometimes necessary to disable some of the markers so you can extract a clearer groove, or snap or quantize data to only the
more important markers. Disabling markers is a way to thin the data so that it creates a clearer time grid to work with. It also avoids
stretching any transients that you don’t want to stretch as a result of quantizing audio. Disabled markers are not deleted, but are
ignored by all AudioSnap functions. Only the head of a disabled marker remains visible.
There are several ways to disable/enable the transient markers in a selected clip:

 The Resolution drop-down list in the AudioSnap palette. The selected Resolution value lets you disable markers based on
their time location. This clears out unwanted markers to make editing easier. Larger values create a bigger time window, based on
musical time values, which preserves markers that are closest to the displayed musical time value, and disables others.
Note: The Resolution setting will only work reliably if the audio clip’s internal tempo map is accurate. For details, see “Editing
a clip’s tempo map” on page 771.

 The Threshold slider in the AudioSnap palette. This slider works by disabling markers based on their volume. Dragging the
slider to the right creates a larger volume threshold, so that transients that fall below the current volume threshold that the slider
defines are disabled.

 The transient marker context menu. You can right-click a marker, and choose Disable from the pop-up menu.
 Press CTRL+ALT+D to disable or re-enable all selected markers.
Tip: If you want to protect a marker from being disabled by the Sensitivity slider or the Threshold slider, you can right-click the
marker and enable the Promote option from the transient marker pop-up menu. You can also promote a disabled marker to ensure
that it never becomes enabled by the Sensitivity slider.

To navigate to the next/previous transient (TAB to transients)
 Do one of the following:
 To move the Now Time to the next transient, press TAB.
 To move the Now Time to the previous transient, press SHIFT+TAB.
Note: TAB to transients is selection-based, which means tabbing will go to the next/previous transient amongst all selected
clips. If there is no selection, tabbing operates on the current track.
For more information, see “TAB to transients” on page 518.

Transient marker appearance
Each transient marker changes its appearance when it is selected, moved, new, disabled, or has certain other characteristics. The
marker handle is only visible when you point to a marker.

Using the AudioSnap palette

Synchronizing audio and the project tempo
There are many reasons why you may want to synchronize audio clips with the project tempo. The following list presents a few
common examples.
AudioSnap provides two ways to quickly synchronize audio and the project tempo map:

 Applying an audio clip’s internal tempo map to the project’s global tempo map. Use this method if you want the project
tempo to match an audio clip’s tempo and have audio beats aligned with the project’s Time Ruler.
This is useful in the following scenarios:

 If you recorded an audio track without using the metronome, and you want the project’s measure and beat boundaries to align
with the audio. For example, you may have recorded an audio track that you would like to use as the tempo reference when
recording additional tracks.

 If you want both audio and MIDI edits to snap to audio beats.
 If you want to use the Quantize and Groove Quantize commands on audio clips, and have audio beats quantized correctly.
 If you want to remix an existing song that has been imported into Cakewalk (from an audio CD or MP3 file, etc.). In order to
add new drum loops and MIDI instruments that play in time with the original song, you need to create a tempo map from the
original song.
For details, see “To sync the project tempo to an audio clip” on page 769.

 Applying the project’s tempo to a clip’s tempo map.

Use this method if you want a clip to follow the project tempo.

This is useful in the following scenarios:

 If you want to synchronize new audio with existing audio.
 If you want to tighten up a new audio track so it fits well with the timing and tempo of an existing track.
 If you want to globally change the project’s tempo after audio has been recorded.
For details, see “To sync an audio clip to the project tempo” on page 770 and “To copy the project tempo to an audio clip’s tempo
map” on page 770.

How does it work?
Each audio clip has an internal tempo map, which makes it possible to synchronize the audio clip with the project’s global tempo
map (see “Editing a clip’s tempo map” on page 771).
Cakewalk automatically creates a tempo map for each audio clip. In some cases, Cakewalk can detect the wrong tempo. For
example, Cakewalk might detect a tempo of 120 BPM when the actual tempo is 240 BPM, or a beat may be mapped to the wrong
transient. You can easily remap the tempo map, if necessary.
You should make sure a clip’s internal tempo map is correct before using any of the tempo-related commands in the AudioSnap
palette. For details, see “Editing a clip’s tempo map” on page 771.

To sync the project tempo to an audio clip
1. Select the audio clip(s) that has the desired tempo map.
2. Press ALT+A to open the AudioSnap palette.
3. Click the Set Project Tempo From Clip button

on the AudioSnap palette.

The clip tempo map is copied to the project tempo map so the tempo maps are identical.
Note 1: The Set Project Tempo From Clip drop-down list lets you specify at which resolution the clip’s tempo map should be
copied to the project tempo. The options are as follows:
• Beats
• Measures (default)
• Clip

Note 2: If multiple audio clips have their Clip Timebase property set to Musical, changing the project tempo will affect the
relative positions of the audio clips. When using the Set Project Tempo from Clip command, Cakewalk will offer to convert
the timebase to Absolute.

AudioSnap
Synchronizing audio and the project tempo

If you need to align the project tempo with freely played MIDI notes, see “To sync the project tempo to freely played MIDI” on
page 876.

Tip: To copy a regular audio clip’s tempo to the project’s tempo map, simply drag the audio clip to the Time Ruler. Cakewalk will extract
the tempo information using Melodyne and ARA and set the global tempo map for that region. It is not necessary to first convert the
audio clip to a Melodyne Region FX clip, but this approach will not allow you to edit the tempo in Melodyne before extracting the tempo.
For details, see “To copy a Melodyne clip’s tempo map to Cakewalk’s tempo map” on page 1176.

To sync an audio clip to the project tempo
1. Select the audio clip(s) that you want to follow the project tempo.
2. Press ALT+A to open the AudioSnap palette.
3. Click the Clip Follows Project Tempo button

on the AudioSnap palette.

The clip is synchronized to the project’s tempo map.
Note: If the audio clip does not play back at the expected tempo, the clip might not have an accurate internal tempo map. For
details about editing a clip’s tempo map, see “Editing a clip’s tempo map” on page 771.

To copy the project tempo to an audio clip’s tempo map
1. Configure the project’s tempo as desired (either specify the tempo manually, or extract the tempo from another audio clip by
using the Set Project Tempo from Clip button

on the AudioSnap palette).

2. Select the audio clip(s) that you want to follow the project tempo.
3. Press ALT+A to open the AudioSnap palette.
4. Click the Average Tempo box on the AudioSnap palette and select Set Clip Tempo From Project on the drop-down menu.
The global project tempo map is copied to the clip tempo map so the tempo maps are identical.
Note: AudioSnap will always attempt to find the tempo of any clip recorded or imported into Cakewalk. While several possible
tempos are normally generated, in some cases AudioSnap may be unable to detect the correct tempo or may not detect a
tempo at all. This can occur if the source material is highly compressed or does not contain transient markers on all actual beats.
If AudioSnap is unable to detect a tempo from the clip, new transient markers are inserted on each beat corresponding to the
project’s global tempo map.
If AudioSnap detects possible tempos for the clip, existing transient markers (that appear within a defined window of the project’s
beats) are reassigned to nearby beat markers on the clip’s tempo map.

AudioSnap
Synchronizing audio and the project tempo

Editing a clip’s tempo map
Each audio clip has an internal tempo map, which makes it possible to synchronize the audio clip with the project’s global tempo
map.
Cakewalk automatically creates a tempo map for each audio clip. In some cases, Cakewalk can detect the wrong tempo. For
example, Cakewalk might detect a tempo of 120 BPM when the actual tempo is 240 BPM, or a beat may be mapped to the wrong
transient. You can easily remap the tempo map, if necessary.
Cakewalk provides a convenient graphical interface for editing a clip’s tempo map.
You should make sure a clip’s internal tempo map is correct before using any of the tempo-related commands in the AudioSnap
palette.
The following figure shows what a Cakewalk-generate clip tempo map might look like.
Figure 367. You can edit the internal tempo map of each audio clip.

The following controls are available when editing a clip’s tempo map:

 Beat markers. Each detected beat has a corresponding beat marker. You can remap a beat marker by dragging the marker to
any active transient marker. When a beat marker has been moved, it turns red and becomes “anchored” to the assigned transient
marker. An “anchored” beat marker is a marker that has been edited as opposed to a beat that Cakewalk detected. To “unanchor” a beat marker, double-click the marker.

 Average Tempo. This list shows the average tempo candidates: original, 0.5x and 2x. Cakewalk will do its best to detect the
correct average tempo, but a clip can often have multiple potential tempos (60 BPM, 120 BPM, 240 BPM, etc.). If Cakewalk is
unable to detect a tempo, Average Tempo will be set to Original, which is the project’s tempo at the location the clip was
recorded or imported. If you change the Average Tempo setting, all clip tempo changes are adjusted to scale.
This list also contains the Set Clip Tempo From Project command, which copies the project’s tempo map to the clip’s tempo
map. This allows the project’s measure boundaries to align with the audio clip.

 Beats per measure. This list lets you specify the number of beats per measure. The value range is 2 to 14, and the default
value is 4.

To edit a clip’s tempo map
1. Select the clip or clips you want to edit.
2. Click the Edit clip tempo map button

on the AudioSnap palette.

A simple tempo map guide appears above the clip, indicating where Cakewalk has mapped the bars/beats of the clip.
3. If the Average Tempo list does not show the correct tempo, select the correct tempo.
4. If the Beats per measure box does not show the correct number of beats, specify the correct number of beats per measure.
5. Starting from the beginning of the clip, inspect the beat markers above the clip. If any beat marker is mapped to the wrong
transient, drag the beat marker to the correct transient.
Figure 368. Drag beat markers to edit the clip tempo map.

AudioSnap
Synchronizing audio and the project tempo

771

Note 1: Beat markers can only be dragged to active transient markers. If you need to drag a beat marker to a position that
doesn’t have a corresponding transient marker, first insert a new transient marker at the desired position. For details, see “To
insert a new transient marker” on page 761.
You can also use the Merge and Lock Markers command to merge transient markers from other tracks. This is useful, for example,
if one track contains beats 1 and 3 and another track contains beats 2 and 4. For details, see “To copy transient markers from one
track to another track” on page 761.

Note 2: If you hold down the CTRL key when you drag a beat marker to the left, the original beat marker and all subsequent
beat markers will be renumbered accordingly.
If you hold down the CTRL key when you drag a beat marker to the right, all subsequent beat markers will be moved by the same
number of transient markers.
The clip’s tempo map is recalculated and the dragged beat marker turns red to indicate it has been “anchored” to a new
transient. An “anchored” beat marker is a marker that has been edited as opposed to a beat that Cakewalk detected. To “unanchor” a beat marker, double-click the marker.
If a beat marker is dragged to a transient marker that is already assigned to a later beat marker, Cakewalk will automatically renumber all subsequent beat markers accordingly.
A beat marker cannot be dragged to an earlier transient marker if that transient is already assigned to a beat marker.
6. To hide the tempo map guide, click the Edit clip tempo map button

on the AudioSnap palette again.

Tip: You can also enable/disable Edit clip tempo map from the transient marker context menu.

To audition an audio clip when editing the clip tempo map
When you are editing a clip’s tempo map, you may frequently need to audition the audio to make sure you are positioning the beat
markers at the correct transients.
1. Right-click the clip tempo map (above the clip) where you want to audition the clip, and keep the right mouse button pressed.
Cakewalk creates a one-measure selection, starting from one measure before the position clicked. The selected time will
gradually increase the longer you keep the mouse button pressed.
2. Release the right mouse button.
Cakewalk auditions the selection.

AudioSnap
Synchronizing audio and the project tempo

Changing a project’s tempo
Changing a whole project’s tempo is simple with AudioSnap, if the tempo change is not drastic.
Before you change the global tempo of a project that contains audio, you must first make sure the audio clips are configured to follow
tempo changes.
After you change the tempo, you may want to bounce some or all of the tracks to new tracks with the Radius algorithms to correct
any unwanted change to each track’s sound.

To change a project’s tempo
1. Use the File > Open command to open the desired project.
2. Use the Edit > Select > All command.
3. Press ALT+A to open the AudioSnap palette.
4. Zoom in (or press F) to get a better look at your clips.
5. With all clips still selected, enable the Clip Follows Project Tempo button

in the AudioSnap palette.

Note: The Clips follow project tempo command only works on clips that are configured to use musical time (the Time Base
property is set to Musical in the Clip Properties Inspector).

All the clips display the Auto Stretch icon

, and will now conform to any new or future tempo changes.

6. In the Control Bar’s Transport module, click the Tempo value

, type the desired tempo value, and press ENTER.

All the tracks stretch to conform to the new tempo. Listen to the project as a whole, and also solo each track to hear how different
the sound is after stretching.

Fixing timing problems in audio clips
AudioSnap provides several ways to fix timing errors in audio clips:

 You can drag individual beats or groups of beats to new positions. This gives you complete control over where each transient
ends up.

 You can quantize to a particular note resolution. This can be a very quick way to fix a clip, if your markers are fairly close to where
you want them to end up.

 You can quantize to another clip’s beats, making the clips share the same groove.
 You can slip-stretch the clip, to make it fit a larger or smaller block of time. This is a very quick way to adjust a clip that has good
timing, but whose tempo may be a little different from the project you want to use it in.

 You can combine techniques: slip-stretch a clip to fit a new tempo, then quantize or drag any markers that are out of sync.
The following is a list of common timing problems and solutions:

 If the audio contains various timing problems, but you want to fix them manually instead of letting AudioSnap fix them
automatically, see “Adjusting the timing of a solo performance” on page 775. This gives you complete control over every aspect of
your audio, and allows you to manually drag audio beats around to perfect the timing.

 If you need to fix a multi-track performance, such as a multi-mic drum kit or a full band, and you need to maintain phase
relationships between tracks, see “Adjusting the timing of a multi-track performance while maintaining phase relationships” on
page 776.

 If you want to synchronize the timing of clips on different tracks, you can fix this with AudioSnap if the sync errors aren’t huge. For
details, see “Synchronizing the rhythms of out-of-sync tracks” on page 779.

 If you want to quantize audio to the project’s Time Ruler, see “To quantize audio to the project’s Time Ruler” on page 780.
 If you want to quickly tighten up a performance in a project that already has a fixed tempo or varying tempo map, see “Quantizing
audio” on page 780. This is useful if you like the performance, but the timing is off in a few places.

 If you want to extract the groove from one clip and apply it to another clip, see “To Groove Quantize an audio clip” on page 780.
You can extract a groove from both audio and MIDI clips.

 If you need to synchronize audio with the projects tempo map, see “Synchronizing audio and the project tempo” on page 769.

Adjusting the timing of a solo performance
When adjusting the timing of a solo performance (for example, a single instrument recorded with a single microphone, or a prerecorded drum loop, etc.), you can freely drag beats around without worrying about potential phase problems.
By manually adjusting beats, you have complete control over the timing of your audio.

To manually adjust the timing of a solo performance
1. Select the Smart tool

in the Control Bar.

2. Assign the track’s Edit Filter control to Audio Transients.
Audio clips display transient markers and the AudioSnap palette appears.
3. Drag the desired transient markers around to perfect the timing.
For more information about editing transient markers, see “Editing transient markers” on page 757.

Adjusting the timing of a multi-track performance while maintaining phase
relationships
Editing a multi-track instrument, such as a multi-microphone drum kit or a full band, requires a little more care than editing a solo
performance.
When stretching or quantizing multi-track audio, it is critical to maintain the phase relationships of the original recording. This can
only be achieved if the tracks are stretched at the same exact points in time across all tracks.
AudioSnap provides tools that make it easy to preserve the phase relationship across tracks when editing beats on individual tracks.
In the following example, you will learn how to use AudioSnap to edit a multi-track drum kit alongside a piano track. The drum kit was
recorded with three microphones (kick, snare, and overhead), each routed to its own track.
To adjust the timing of a multi-track performance while maintaining phase relationships
The following figure shows the last three hits of a song. The top track is piano and the rest are drums: kick, snare and overhead.
Figure 369. The drum hits are rushed and are not in sync with the Piano track.

A

B

A. Piano track B. Drum tracks

As you can see, the drummer has rushed and is not in time with the piano. At the beginning of the measure, the drummer is in time
with the piano. Over the course of the measure, the drummer is performing a fill and on the next three beats is way ahead of the
piano player. You can see how the transient markers on the drum tracks are progressively earlier as the measure goes on (the
drummer is rushing).
Our job is to align the drum hits with the piano hits so that the drum and piano tracks in time all the way through the measure.
1. Select the Smart tool

in the Control Bar.

2. Assign the track’s Edit Filter control to Audio Transients.
Audio clips display transient markers and the AudioSnap palette appears.
3. Select the three drum tracks and make splits right before and right after the area you want to edit. For details, see “To split clips
into smaller clips” on page 521.
4. Select only the kick and snare clips.
5. On the AudioSnap palette, set Resolution to 1/16.
6. Select only the drum overhead track.
7. On the AudioSnap palette, set Threshold to 100% to ensure that there are no transients detected. This step is necessary
because the overhead track contains audio from both the kick and the snare, and you want to make sure the kick, snare and
overhead tracks are always synchronized when stretching beats.
8. Select all three drum tracks.
9. Right-click any selected clip and select Merge and Lock Markers on the pop-up menu.

776

AudioSnap
Fixing timing problems in audio clips

All three drum tracks now share the exact same transient markers, and each clip’s position is locked.
Note: When you fix timing errors in multi-tracked drum parts, you typically need to adjust all the drum parts in exactly the same
way, because drum parts often contain “bleed”—the sound of other drums in the track of the drum that you are trying to record.
For example, if your snare mic also picks up some of the hi-hat sound, you can’t move hi-hat clips around without also moving
the snare clips in exactly the same way, otherwise the sound of the hi-hat in the hi-hat track will conflict with the sound of the
hi-hat in the snare track.
Any time you have a track that contains “bleed” from other audio tracks, such as drum overhead tracks or room ambiance tracks, you
want to make sure the track has the same identical transient markers as the individual close-mic tracks. The first step is to disable all
transient markers in the overhead/room track, then use the Merge and Lock Markers command to copy the transient markers from
all individual close-mic tracks.
Figure 370. The Merge and Lock Markers command has copied the same transient markers to all three drum tracks.

The drum tracks are now ready to be edited.
We want to keep the feel of the piano track, so our goal is align the drum tracks with the piano track, while preserving the phase
relationship between the three drum tracks.
When editing multiple transients to adjust the timing of a performance, often times you need to speed up or slow down a section
rather than just move an entire section later or earlier. In this example, the drummer was speeding up through the drum fill and then
hits next downbeat too early. To fix this, you need to proportionally drag the drum transients so they are better aligned with the piano
track.
10. Using the Smart tool, lasso select all transient markers from the first hit through the third hit, across all drum tracks.
11. Hold down the CTRL key and drag any selected drum transient marker until the third drum hit is aligned with the third piano hits.
The selected transients are stretched proportionally. The first and last drum and piano hits are now aligned. The effect of this edit
is that the drummer no longer rushes through the fill and he lands on the downbeat much closer with the piano.

Figure 371. The drum and piano hits are aligned.

The second drum and piano hits are close but not perfect, so we need to fix this single beat.
12. Hold down the CTRL key and double-click any drum transient marker on the second hit.
All drum transient markers for the second hit are selected
13. Drag any selected transient markers until it aligns with the second piano hit.
All three drum and piano hits are now aligned properly, and the phase relationships between all drum tracks have been
preserved.
Figure 372. All three drum and piano hits are perfectly aligned.

Fixing timing problems in audio clips

Synchronizing the rhythms of out-of-sync tracks
A common problem arises when two or more clips aren’t quite in sync with each other. You can fix this with AudioSnap if the sync
errors aren’t huge. The AudioSnap command that is most helpful in this situation is the Quantize to Pool command. The way it
works is you decide which clip has the correct rhythm, you add that clip’s transient markers to the Pool, and then you quantize the
other clip’s transient markers to the Pool. For details, see “To quantize an audio clip to another audio clip (Quantize to Pool)” on page
781.
Tip: You can also copy one clip’s tempo to the project tempo, then configure other clips to follow the project tempo. For details, see
“To sync the project tempo to an audio clip” on page 769 and “To sync an audio clip to the project tempo” on page 770.

Quantizing audio
Quantizing audio is a quick way to tighten up the feel of an audio track. AudioSnap provides several ways to quantize audio:

 You can quantize audio to the project’s Time Ruler. This is useful for tightening up a performance in a project that already has a
fixed tempo or varying tempo map. For details, see “To quantize audio to the project’s Time Ruler” on page 780.

 You can copy the feel of one track and apply it to another track. There are four ways to accomplish this with AudioSnap:
 Method 1: Extract MIDI timing from the source track, then use Groove Quantize on the target track. For details, see “To extract
MIDI timing from an audio clip” on page 786 and “To Groove Quantize an audio clip” on page 780.

 Method 2: Add the source track to the Pool, then quantize the target track to the pool. For details, see “To quantize an audio
clip to another audio clip (Quantize to Pool)” on page 781 and “Using the Pool” on page 793.

 Method 3: Use the Extract Timing button on the AudioSnap palette to extract the timing from selected clips, then use the
Apply Groove button to apply the extracted groove to the selected clips. For details, see “To extract the groove from one clip
and apply it to another clip” on page 780.

 Method 4: You can manually match transient markers across multiple tracks by using the Smart tool. For details, see “To
manually match transients across different tracks” on page 781.

To quantize audio to the project’s Time Ruler
1. Select the audio clip you want to quantize.
2. Press ALT+A to open the AudioSnap palette.
3. Click the Quantize button

in the AudioSnap palette.

The Quantize dialog box appears.
4. Make sure the AudioSnap Beats check box is selected.
5. Configure the Quantize options as desired, then click OK.
Cakewalk quantizes the selected clips.
Note: You can only quantize to one rhythmic value at a time. If you don’t want to quantize all beats in an audio clip (to ensure the
Quantize command doesn’t move them to a rhythmic placement where they don’t belong), temporarily disable any transient
markers you don’t want to quantize. For details, see “To disable a transient marker” on page 760.

To Groove Quantize an audio clip
The Groove Quantize command aligns transients with a groove that’s on the Clipboard or a pre-existing groove file. If you want to
copy the timing from another audio clip to the Clipboard, see “To extract MIDI timing from an audio clip” on page 786.
1. Select the audio clip you want to groove quantize.
2. Press ALT+A to open the AudioSnap palette.
3. On the Process menu, click Groove Quantize.
The Groove Quantize dialog box appears.

• If there are no selected tracks, audio transients snap to transients in the selected clip.
4. Select the audio tracks that you want to use as the rhythm guide.
5. Identify the transient markers you want move, then drag the transient markers until they snap to the nearest transient markers in
the selected tracks.

To quantize an audio clip to another audio clip (Quantize to Pool)
A common problem arises when two or more clips aren’t quite in sync with each other. You can fix this with AudioSnap if the sync
errors aren’t huge. The AudioSnap command that is most helpful in this situation is the Quantize to Pool command. The way it
works is you decide which clip has the correct rhythm, you add that clip’s transient markers to the Pool, and then you quantize the
other clip’s transient markers to the Pool.
1. Select the Smart tool

2. Assign the track’s Edit Filter control to Audio Transients.
Audio clips show transient markers and the AudioSnap palette appears.
3. Select the audio clip that you want to use as the rhythm guide.
4. Disable any transient markers that you want to exclude from the Pool (see “To disable a transient marker” on page 760).
5. Right-click the selected clip and select Pool > Add clip to pool on the pop-up menu.
The selected clip is added to the Pool, and its transient markers turn purple.
6. Select the audio clip that you want to quantize.
7. Right-click the selected clip and select Pool > Quantize to pool on the pop-up menu.
The Quantize to AudioSnap Pool dialog box appears.
8. Configure the following settings as desired:

 Max Distance From Pool. The value in this menu determines which notes are affected by the Quantize to Pool command.
For example, if you choose Quarter in the menu, notes that are farther than a quarter note from a Pool line are not quantized.

 Quantize Window. This slider fine tunes the value in the Max Distance From Pool menu. A window of 100 percent
includes all markers that lie within the Max Distance From Pool value.

 Quantize Strength. This slider controls quantize strength, which determines how closely the selected notes move to the
Pool markers.
9. Click OK.
The transients in the selected clips are quantized to the Pool.

To quantize multi-tracked drums without stretching audio
When you fix timing errors in multi-tracked drum parts, you will frequently need to adjust all the drum parts in exactly the same way,
because drum parts often contain “bleed”—the sound of other drums in the track of the drum that you are trying to record. For
example, if your snare mic also picks up some of the hi-hat sound, you can’t move hi-hat clips around without also moving the snare
clips in exactly the same way, because if you don’t, the sound of the hi-hat in the hi-hat track will conflict with the sound of the hi-hat
in the snare track.
AudioSnap’s Add Transients to Pool command and Split Beats into Clips command allow you to slice your drum tracks at
identical locations, so you can then drag or quantize whole clips without stretching any audio. This method of aligning clips does not
change the phase relationships between the clips, as long as you move all the clips identically.
Let’s take a look at some multi-tracked drum parts, and see how to quantize them all in exactly the same way. The following project
uses 10 mics, including room mics and overhead mics:

1. Select the Smart tool

in the Control Bar.

2. Assign the track’s Edit Filter control to Audio Transients.
Audio clips display transient markers and the AudioSnap palette appears.
3. If necessary, edit each drum track’s transient markers so that there are no extraneous transients (use the Threshold slider,
disable some transients, move others, etc.).
4. Disable all the transient markers in the overhead mic and room mic tracks.
Note: The room mics and overhead mics are much farther from the drums than the close mics, so the transients in their tracks
occur a little later than the close mic tracks. Because you will eventually split each beat into a separate clip, you only want to
use the transient markers from the close mic tracks to avoid cutting off any transients.
5. Select all the drum tracks.
6. Right-click any selected drum track and select Merge and Lock Markers on the pop-up menu.
7. All transient markers on all selected tracks are copied to each drum track, so all drum tracks share identical transient markers.
The clip positions are also locked.
8. On the Edit menu, point to Clip Lock and click Lock Position.
The clip positions are no longer locked.
9. Select a drum track that has steady beats throughout the song.
Tip: If there is not a single drum track that has steady beats throughout the song, you can create a temporary guide track by bouncing
all the drum tracks to a single track (select all the tracks, use the Edit > Bounce to Tracks command, select Hardware Outputs
in the Source Category field in the Bounce to Tracks dialog box, and click OK).
10. Click the Set Project Tempo From Clip button

to align measure lines with drum track and establish a tempo map.

The project’s measure boundaries line up with the transients in the drum tracks.
Note: If the measure boundaries do not line up properly with the drum tracks, you may need to edit the guide track’s tempo
map. For details, see “To edit a clip’s tempo map” on page 771.

Now we can quantize all the clips at the same time. Let’s quantize this example to eighth notes:
13. Select all the clips that you want to quantize.
14. Use the Process > Quantize command to open the Quantize dialog box.

15. In the Duration field, choose Eighth (for this example).
16. Configure the other settings as follows:

 Make sure the AudioSnap Beats check box is cleared.
 Make sure the Audio Clip Start Times is selected.

 Make sure the Auto XFade Audio Clips check box is selected, and the XFade and Max Gap values are set at their default
values.

17. Click OK to close the Quantize dialog box.
After some processing time, the clip start times move to the eighth note boundaries:

Some clips now overlap, and some clips have small gaps between them. Because the Auto XFade Audio Clips check box was
enabled, and the XFade and Max Gap values were set at their default values, crossfades have been automatically added between
clips, and any gaps that were smaller than the Max Gap value have been filled in. Let’s zoom in to take a closer look:

Extracting MIDI timing information from audio
Extracting MIDI timing information from audio allows you to:

 Double an audio rhythm with a MIDI instrument.
 Replace sounds in an audio clip (commonly used for drum replacement).
 Notate the rhythm of an audio clip.
 Align lyrics with an audio rhythm.
After you extract the timing information from an audio clip, the timing information is copied to the Clipboard as MIDI note events. You
can paste the MIDI notes to a new MIDI track or use the Clipboard as a source for the Groove Quantize command.

To extract MIDI timing from an audio clip
1. Select the Smart tool

in the Control Bar.

2. Assign the track’s Edit Filter control to Audio Transients.
3. Press ALT+A to open the AudioSnap palette.
4. Select the audio clip whose rhythm you want to extract.
5. Do any necessary quantizing, and disable any transient markers that you don’t want to extract (see “Quantizing audio” on page
780 and “To disable a transient marker” on page 760).
6. With the clip still selected, click the AudioSnap Options button
dialog box.

in the AudioSnap palette to open the AudioSnap Options

7. In the Convert to MIDI Note box, choose C3. This is the note most drum synths use for the bass drum. If your favorite synth
uses a different note, choose it now.
8. Choose a Note Velocities option: either accept the extrapolated velocities in the audio clip (the Vary With Pulse Level option),
or set a constant velocity for the notes in the Set All to Same Value field.
9. Click OK to close the AudioSnap Options dialog box.
10. Click the Copy As MIDI button

.

This adds the extracted groove to the Clipboard.
Cakewalk copies the audio rhythm to the Clipboard as a MIDI clip, with the same pitch assigned to each note.
You can now paste the MIDI notes to a new MIDI track, use the Clipboard as a source for the Groove Quantize command, or save
the extracted groove as a Groove Quantize file.

To paste the extracted MIDI timing to a MIDI track
1. Click the track number of a MIDI track to select it.
2. Move the Now Time to the measure where you want the data (we’ll use measure 1).
Tip: If you want the MIDI notes to align perfectly with the audio data, press SHIFT+G to move the Now time to the beginning of the
selected audio clip.
3. Press CTRL+V to paste the data.
A new MIDI clip is inserted in the track
Note: All the new MIDI notes have the same pitch, and the tails of the preceding notes reach all the way to the following notes,
so you can’t see the actual rhythm. You can easily shorten the duration of each note event in order to clearly see each note
event. To do so, click Process > Length to open the Length dialog box. In the Length dialog box, disable the Start Times
check box, enable the Duration check box, and type 50 in the Percent field. Click OK to close the dialog box. Assign the MIDI
track’s Edit Filter to Notes and you will be able to see the rhythm if you zoom in.

When snapping audio transients, the following rules apply:

 If a Pool exists, audio transients snap to the Pool.
 If a Pool does not exists, audio transients snap to transients in the selected tracks.
 If there are no selected tracks, audio transients snap to transients in the selected clip.
In the following example, you will learn how to snap MIDI notes to audio beats.

To snap to audio transients
1. Select the audio clips whose rhythm you want to snap to.
2. In the Control Bar’s Snap module, select the Landmark Events button

.

Note: If events do not appear to snap to audio transients, go to Edit > Preferences > Customization - Snap to Grid (or rightclick the Snap to Grid button

Splitting beats into clips
Clicking the Split Beats Into Clips button
on the AudioSnap palette splits a selected AudioSnap-enabled clip into new clips
starting at every enabled transient marker. The main reason you might want to do this is to align a clip with a new tempo or quantize
it, without stretching the audio. Once you split a clip at its transients, you can move the new clips by dragging or quantizing so that
they are aligned the way you want them to be. The advantage is that moving clips instead of transient markers does not stretch any
audio, so that the original sound quality is unchanged. The possible disadvantage is that you can create gaps between the new clips
when you move them. However, the Quantize, Groove Quantize, and Fade Selected Clips dialogs all have an option to
automatically fill in the gaps. This is the Fill Gaps, XFade between Audio Clips option in the Fade Selected Clips dialog box, and
is the Auto XFade Audio Clips option in the Quantize and Groove Quantize dialogs. Filling the gaps is accomplished
automatically by “rolling out” the first clip’s right edge and the second clip’s left edge to create a crossfade. This option will often be
used when quantizing drum parts, which results in smooth-sounding audio without introducing phase problems.
Note: When you align clips on multiple tracks, it is necessary to split and/or quantize all clips at the exact same position in order
to avoid phase problems. In order to do so, it is necessary to establish a common, or master, transient pool that all tracks can
reference. The Merge and Lock Markers command will use the transient pool as a reference, and insert identical transient
markers on all selected clips. You can then use the Split Beats Into Clips button

to split clips at audio beats.

To add markers at Pool lines
1. Select the Smart tool

in the Control Bar.

2. Assign the track’s Edit Filter control to Audio Transients.
3. Make sure that the Pool contains markers from at least one clip, or from the Time Ruler.
4. Select the clips that you want to add markers to.
5. Right-click a selected clip, and choose Pool > Apply transient pool markers on the pop-up menu.
Markers appear on the selected clips at Pool lines.

To split a clip at beats
1. Select the clip(s) that you want to split.
2. Press ALT+A to open the AudioSnap palette.
3. Click the Split Beats into Clips button

.

The clip’s beats are split into separate clips.

To split a clip, quantize it, and fill in the gaps
1. The following picture shows a clip whose transient markers don’t line up with the measure lines:

2. If we quantize it, the audio will stretch and we may or may not like the resulting sound. Let’s try splitting it, and quantizing the
clips instead of the transients: click the Split Beats Into Clips button

on the AudioSnap palette.

The clip splits at the transients, and only the first new clip is still selected:

3. Let’s quantize the clips: drag through the clips to select them.
4. Click the Quantize button

in the AudioSnap palette.

The Quantize dialog box appears:

5. Make sure that Audio Clip Start Times is selected, and that (for this example) Sixteenth is selected in the Duration field. Leave
the Auto XFade Audio Clips option unchecked for now, and click OK. Let’s zoom in and look at the quantized clips:

6. The start of each clip now lines up where we want it to, but there are gaps between some of the clips. Let’s undo what we just did
(press CTRL+Z), and quantize again. This time, however we will enable the Auto XFade Audio Clips option in the Quantize
dialog box, and click OK:

A
A. Crossfades

7. Where the gaps were between clips, we now see crossfades. The default length of the crossfade is 20 milliseconds, but you can
change that by entering a number in the XFade <number goes here> ms field in the dialog box.
8. If you don’t want wide gaps to be filled in, you can enter a number of up to 200 milliseconds in the Max Gap field. Any gap that is
wider than the number in this field will not be filled in.
If we wanted to drag the clips to new locations instead of quantizing them, we could fix any resulting gaps by selecting the clips that
have gaps, and use the Track view Clips > Fade Clips command.
The Fade Selected Clips dialog box has the Fill Gaps, XFade between Audio Clips radio button, the XFade <number goes
here> ms field, and the Max Gap field.
Figure 374. The Fade Selected Clips dialog box.

To fill in gaps with the Fade Selected Clips command
1. Select the clips that have gaps you want to fill.
2. Click the Track view Clips menu and choose Fade Clips to open the Fade Selected Clips dialog box.
3. Enable the XFade between Audio Clips radio button, and set any options you want in the XFade <number goes here> ms
field, and Max Gap field.

Using the Pool
The Pool is a collection of transient markers that can be extracted as a groove, and also function as snap locations. A transient
marker that belongs to the pool is displayed in the Clips pane as a solid line within the parent track, and as a dotted line outside the
parent track. Hovering the mouse over a dotted line will display a tooltip containing the parent track and position.

To show/hide pool lines
1. Select the Smart tool

in the Control Bar.

2. Assign the desired track’s Edit Filter control to Audio Transients.
3. Right-click a clip and choose Pool > Show pool lines on the pop-up menu.

The Track view Time Ruler can be added to the Pool (see “To add the Time ruler to the Pool” on page 793).

To add a clip’s transients to the Pool
1. Select the an AudioSnap-enabled clip.
2. Right-click the clip and choose Pool > Add Clip to Pool on the pop-up menu.

To hide or show the Pool
1. Select the Smart tool

in the Control Bar.

2. Assign the track’s Edit Filter control to Audio Transients.
3. Right-click a clip and choose Pool > Show pool lines on the pop-up menu.

To add the Time ruler to the Pool
1. In the Control Bar’s Snap module, set the Musical Time value to the resolution you would like to add to the Pool.
2. Select the Smart tool

4. Select the clips that you want to add markers to.
5. Right-click a selected clip and choose Pool > Apply transient pool markers on the pop-up menu.
Markers appear on the selected clips at Pool lines. When aligning clips on multiple tracks, it is necessary to split and/or quantize all
clips at the exact same position in order to avoid phase problems when quantizing audio. In order to do so, it is necessary to
establish a common, or “master”, transient reference pool which can be applied to all tracks. The Apply transient pool markers
command will use the transient pool as a reference, and insert identical transient markers on all selected clips.
Note: Adding markers at Pool lines can add a lot of markers to a clip. If you later decide that you want to work with the clip’s
original markers, you can remove only the markers that you added by right-clicking the transient marker, and choosing Reset
from the pop-up menu.

Groove Quantize and Quantize to Pool
You can use two kinds of groove quantizing on audio clips: the Groove Quantize command aligns transients with a groove that’s on
the Clipboard, and the Quantize to pool command aligns transients with the Pool.
When you use the Groove Quantize command, you can align a clip with a pre-existing groove, or you can extract a groove from
another clip.
For information about extracting a groove, see “To extract MIDI timing from an audio clip” on page 786.
For information about groove quantizing an audio clip, see “To Groove Quantize an audio clip” on page 780.

AudioSnap
Using the Pool

Algorithms and rendering
When you stretch an audio clip, AudioSnap uses a particular formula, or algorithm, to stretch the audio. The best algorithms take the
most computing time and power to complete, so if AudioSnap always used the best available algorithms (the iZotope Radius
algorithms), you would not be able to play back your clip in a reasonable amount of time to listen to the timing. That’s why you can
choose a quick algorithm for “online” rendering (real-time playback), and a different algorithm for “offline” or non-real-time
rendering. Offline rendering in an AudioSnap context usually means bouncing to track, but it also refers to other offline processes
such as freezing tracks and applying effects. When you do any of these mixdown operations such as bouncing, exporting, or
freezing, audio clips use the offline rendering algorithm you have chosen for them.
Note: The Online stretch method is for preview purposes only during playback. The final audio quality will be greatly improved
after the Offline stretch method is applied during mixdown/export.
Typical algorithm choices for an AudioSnap session work like this:

 Do your AudioSnap time stretching, error correction, etc., with a quick algorithm: choose either Percussion or GrooveClip.
 After your AudioSnap editing is finished, bounce to track with a better algorithm: choose one of the Radius choices, or for drum
tracks, Percussion is usually the best choice.
Note: You should avoid rendering AudioSnap clips more than once. Applying stretch algorithms multiple times in succession
can degrade the audio quality (similar to transcoding an MP3 file).
Until your project is mixed and finalized, it is recommended that you use the Freeze function instead of Bounce to Track(s) or
Bounce to Clip(s) if you need to temporarily off-load CPU processing power. For details, see “To freeze an AudioSnap-enabled
clip” on page 796.
The following table describes the available algorithms.
Algorithm

Description

Groove

Good all-around algorithm to use while stretching audio

Percussion

Gives a better sound on percussion clips while stretching audio

iZotope Radius Mix

Best all-around choice when bouncing to track with audio clips that contain a mix of different sounds

iZotope Radius Mix Advanced

This choice is similar to iZotope Radius Mix, but exposes two parameters:
• Pitch coherence. Pitch coherence preserves naturalness of timbre for pitched solo voices, such
as human speech, saxophone or vocals. The default value for this control is 50%. Higher values of
pitch coherence will increase phase accuracy but may sound more modulated.
• Phase coherence. When processing stereo or surround audio, Phase coherence helps to
preserve the phase relationships between channels. The default value for this control is 50%.
Higher values of phase coherence will preserve the phase between multiple audio channels at the
expense of slight distortion.
The Pitch coherence and Phase coherence parameters can be adjusted in Edit > Preferences >
Audio - Playback and Recording.

iZotope Radius Solo

Best choice when bouncing to track with audio clips of a solo instrument. Although a guitar is a “solo”
instrument, if you play chords instead of single notes you may want to select “Radius Mix” instead.
Tip: if a clip/track contains a mixture of polyphonic and monophonic parts, you may want to split the
parts into separate clips and experiment with different algorithms for each clip.

iZotope Radius Solo (Bass)

Best choice when bouncing to track with audio clips of a bass instrument

iZotope Radius Solo (Vocal)

Best choice when bouncing to track with audio clips of a solo voice

Elastique Pro

Elastique Pro is a general purpose high quality time-stretching engine that fulfills the demands of
professional productions and broadcast applications. It minimizes stretching artifacts, offers stable
timing, inter-channel phase coherence and sample accurate stretching which allows for sharp
transients and crystal clear vocals.

Elastique Efficient

Elastique Efficient gives you similar time-stretching quality as Elastique Pro, but with a lower CPU hit.
The algorithm is targeted at complex polyphonic signals like complete mixes and offers the same
transient preservation as Elastique Pro.

Working with loops and Groove Clips

Loops are short digital audio clips which are often designed to be repeated over and over or “looped,” although some loops, called
one-shots, are intended to play just once. Groove clips, often used as loops, are digital audio clips that “know” their tempo and pitch
information. Groove clips automatically respond to changes in a project’s tempo and can have their root note pitch adjusted using
pitch markers. In Cakewalk, you can import ACID™ loops, or digital audio clips and convert them to Groove clips. You can also
record your own audio and create Groove clips. To download more Groove clips and loops, visit www.cakewalk.com.
Note: Groove clips and ACIDized loops are loaded into RAM, and can take up a lot of memory. Copying them does not increase
the amount of memory they take up, but loading the initial copy does.

 Resolution. The slice Resolution control sets the resolution for the creation of markers, or the “slicing” of the looped clip. This
control uses the following note durations:

 No Slice
 Whole Note
 1/2 Note
 1/4 Note
 1/8 Note
 1/16 Note
 1/32 Note
The automatic markers appear at the note resolutions according to the Resolution setting. At the eighth note setting, there are
eight markers per measure.
This control works well for slicing audio that has more subtle changes in volume with few dramatic transients.
The markers in a loop clip preserve the timing of the audio at that moment. Too few or too many markers can cause unwanted
“artifacts” when a loop clip is stretched.

 Threshold. The Threshold control senses transients in your audio clip and assigns a marker at the beginning and end of each
one it finds. As you increase the number in this field, smaller transients are detected and the number of markers increases.

 Beats. The number of beats (quarter notes) in the clip.
 BPM. The tempo at which the clip was recorded.
 Pitch. The Follow Project Pitch option transposes the loop, if necessary, to the key of the project. A loop recorded in the key of
A, used in a project in the key of C, would be transposed up three semitones if the Follow Project Pitch check box was checked.

 Root Note. The Root Note represents the key in which the loop was recorded. The Follow Project Pitch feature uses this
information, when checked, to transpose the loop to match the project’s key.

 Coarse Pitch. You can set the transposition of a clip, independent from the project pitch, using the Coarse Pitch field. A
positive number transposes the clip up by that number of semitones. A negative number transposes the clip down by that number
of semitones. Remember that, if the Follow Project Pitch option is checked, the clip follows the project’s pitch, so any
transposition changes you make using this option are changes to the project pitch, not the clip pitch.
An example: The project key is C. The clip key is D. If the Follow Project Pitch option is checked, the clip is transposed down by
two semitones. A value entered into the Pitch (semitone) field adjusts the pitch from C. If you enter “-1” the pitch would be
transposed down by one additional semitone to B.
Another example: The clip pitch is E. The desired clip pitch is D. If the Follow Project Pitch option is not checked, and a value
of “2” is entered in the Pitch (semitones) field, the clip is transposed down two semitones to D from the original pitch of E.

 Fine Pitch. The Pitch (fine) field allows you to make tuning adjustments or to transpose the pitch of a clip up to 50 cents. There
are 100 cents in one semitone. A Pitch (fine) setting of 1 adjusts the pitch up one hundredth of a semitone. The Pitch (fine) option
can “fine tune” a slightly out of tune clip so that it is in pitch with the remaining clips in a project.

Slicing markers

There are two types of slicing markers in the Loop Construction view: automatic and manual. Automatic markers appear in red and
are automatically generated by Cakewalk when you loop enable a clip. The one exception to this is if you import an ACIDized wave
file into Cakewalk. ACIDized files always appear with manual slicing markers. Manual markers appear in purple. If you add a marker
or move an automatic marker, it turns purple to show you that it has been edited. For information on editing slicing markers, see “To
edit the slicing markers in a Groove Clip” on page 809.

Beat markers

Beat Markers mark where the beats fall in your clip. There are as many beat markers as there are beats in a clip.

Audio scaling
Audio scaling is the increase or decrease in the size (scale) of the waveform in clip. Audio scaling allows you to make detailed edits
by zooming in on the parts of the waveform closest to the zero crossing (silence) while preserving the track size. By showing just the
quietest parts of a clip, you can make very precise edits.
The Audio Scale Ruler is located on the far left of the Loop Construction view.
Figure 377. Audio scale ruler.

B

A. Audio Scale Ruler B. Clip

There are three right-click display options in the Audio Scale Ruler:

 Percentage. Shows audio scaling by percentage. For example, if the highest percentage in the Audio Scale Ruler reads 2.0%,
then only the parts of the waveform which are within 2% of the zero crossing appear in the clip.

 dB. Shows audio scaling by dB. For example, if the highest dB in the Audio Scaling Ruler reads -36, then only the parts of the
waveform which are 36 dB below 0 dB appear in the clip.

 Zoom Factor. Shows audio scaling by a factor. For example, if the Zoom Factor reads 10, then the waveform is zoomed in by a
factor of 10.

 In the Clip Properties Inspector’s Groove Clip section, select the Looping check box.
 Press CTRL+L.
 Right-click the clip and choose Groove Clip Looping on the pop-up menu.
To create repetitions of a loop
1. Set the Snap value if you want the loop to repeat at precise time boundaries.
2. Move the cursor over the end of the loop-enabled clip until the cursor looks like this

.

3. When the cursor changes, click the end or beginning of the clip and drag it to the right (if you are dragging out from the end) or
left (if you are dragging from the beginning).
The clip repeats itself until you stop dragging.

To create partial repetitions of a loop
1. Move the cursor over the end of the loop-enabled clip until the cursor looks like this

.

2. When the cursor changes, click the end or beginning of the clip and drag it to the right (if you are dragging out from the end) or
left (if you are dragging from the beginning).

Working with Groove Clip audio
Groove clips are .wav files that behave similarly to MAGIX GmbH’s ACIDized loops (Cakewalk also has MIDI Groove clips—see
“MIDI Groove Clips” on page 813). Groove clips contain information about the audio content, including the original tempo, original
reference pitch, number of beats in the loop, and audio transient information.
See:
“How Groove Clips work in Cakewalk” on page 806
“Using Groove Clips” on page 807
“Creating and editing Groove Clips” on page 807
“Using pitch markers in the Track view” on page 811
“Working with REX files” on page 812

How Groove Clips work in Cakewalk
Groove clips have information saved within them which allow them to adjust to changes in tempo and pitch. Groove clips can read a
project’s tempo and tempo changes, and can adjust their root note pitch when they read pitch markers. You can add pitch markers in
the Track view’s Time Ruler to transpose the Groove clip. As your project passes over a pitch marker, Cakewalk transposes your
Groove clips based on the clip’s root note reference pitch. If you insert no pitch markers in your project, there are no pitch changes in
your Groove clips. The default project pitch is C.
Note 1: When working with Groove clips, it is important to know the difference between key and pitch. Your project’s key
signature has no effect on Groove clips. The pitch of your Follow Project Pitch-enabled Groove clips is dictated by pitch markers
in the Time Ruler. If there are no pitch markers in your project, these Groove clips play at the pitch set in Project > Set Default
Groove Clip Pitch (the default is C).

Note 2: Groove clips must be at least one beat in length. If you try to loop-enable a clip of a shorter duration you may experience
distortion or artifacts.

Using Groove Clips
Groove clips are easy to use because they automatically adjust to your project’s pitch markers and tempo. You can import existing
loops or create your own, using the Loop Construction view.

To import a Groove Clip into your project
1. Select a Track in the Track view.
2. Set the Now Time to the place you want the clip to begin.
3. Select File > Import > Audio from the menu.
The Open dialog box appears.
4. Navigate to a directory that contains Groove clips and select one.
5. Click Open.
Or
1. Open the Browser and click the Media button

.

2. Navigate to a directory that contains Groove clips.
3. Drag and drop a clip into the Track view, or double-click it to insert it at the Now Time.
4. The clip appears on the track and at the time in your project where you drop it, so if you want the clip on a new track, drop it after
the last track in your project.
By default, Groove clips are loop-enabled and transposed to match the project’s pitch.

Setting the default project pitch
Go to Project > Set Default Groove Clip Pitch and specify the default pitch.
Your project now uses the root note of your clips to transpose to the project pitch. Use Pitch markers at different points in your project
to change the pitch. For more information about Pitch markers, see “Using pitch markers in the Track view” on page 811.

Creating and editing Groove Clips
Any audio clip can be converted to a Groove clip. Groove clips contain tempo, beat, and pitch information which Cakewalk uses to
stretch and transpose the clips to match the project. Most Groove clips are loop-enabled, meaning that you can use the mouse to
drag clip repetitions in the Track view. Groove clips can be either loop-enabled or not, although they usually are. When a Groove clip
is loop-enabled, its edges appear beveled. It is sometimes desirable to create clips that follow the project’s tempo and key, but are
not intended to loop. The following is a list of the attributes contained in a Groove clip:

 Beats in clip. The number of quarter notes in a clip. A four measure clip in 4/4 time should have 16 beats. When you enable
looping for a clip, Cakewalk calculates the number of beats in the clip using an algorithm. This calculation is very often accurate,
but in some cases, for instance when the clip has a very slow or very fast tempo or if the clip has an unusual number of beats,
then the number of beats in a clip may have to be edited manually in the Beats in clip field.

 Original tempo. The original tempo of the recording. Cakewalk uses the original tempo to adjust to your project’s tempo. The
original tempo must be specified for stretching clips.
Note: When you loop-enable a clip, Cakewalk calculates the original tempo of the clip, and unless the clip’s length is in exact
beat or measure increments, the original tempo that Cakewalk calculates may vary from the recorded tempo. These fluctuations
are usually quite small and do not affect the quality of the Groove clip you create.

 Reference note. The original key of the recorded clip. Cakewalk uses the Reference note when it transposes Groove clips to
match your project’s pitch.
These attributes can be edited in the Loop Construction view. For more information about the Loop Construction view, see “Loop
Construction view” on page 1857.

To set the number of beats in a Groove Clip
When you open a clip in the Loop Construction view, Cakewalk determines the number of beats in the clip. In some cases the beat
value may not be correct. The beats in clip value can only be changed if the clip is loop enabled.
Do the following to change value in the Beats field.

 Click the Plus or Minus button to the right of the Beats field until the correct value is displayed.

To change the Loop Construction view Time ruler display
You can display the Loop Construction view Time Ruler in measures or in samples. To toggle between the two modes, double-click
the Time Ruler.

To set the tempo of a Groove Clip
When creating a new Groove clip, Cakewalk sets the clip’s tempo to the current project tempo. To ensure proper stretching behavior
you must set the value in the BPM field to the tempo at which you recorded the clip. The tempo value of a clip can only be changed
if the clip is stretch-enabled.
Do the following to change the value in the BPM field.

 Click the Plus or Minus button to the right of the BPM field until the correct value is displayed. For more precise tempos you can
double-click in the BPM field and enter a tempo.

To slice a Groove Clip
1. Double-click on a clip in the Clips pane.
The clip appears in the Loop Construction view.
2. Slice the clip using one or all of the following methods:
To do this

Do this

Slice the clip on note divisions

Click the Resolution button and select the desired note resolution in the drop-down list. The available
settings range from whole notes to 64th notes. Selecting quarter notes, for example, will create four
markers per measure.

Slice the clip at transient peaks

Drag the Threshold slider to the desired value. The larger transients in the clip will be flanked by
markers.

Slice the clip manually

Move your mouse to the space above the Time Ruler and double-click to add a marker. Click and drag
the marker, if necessary, so it aligns with the beginning or end of a transient.

3. Play your project and adjust the slicing of your clip as necessary.
Note: You can use any or all of these methods to slice a clip. If you adjust both the Resolution and Threshold values, two
markers may be placed right next to each other. If these markers are too close, the markers will automatically merge. Manual
markers will not automatically merge.

To transpose a Groove Clip to match your project’s pitch
Follow this procedure to force the Groove clip to follow the project’s default pitch.
1. Double-click the clip you want to transpose to the project’s pitch.
The clip appears in the Loop Construction view.
2. Click the Pitch button.

To transpose a Groove Clip by semitones
Follow this procedure to transpose a Groove clip by any number of semitones.
1. Double-click the clip you want to transpose to the project’s pitch.
The clip appears in the Loop Construction view.
2. If the Pitch button is enabled, click it to disable it.
3. In the Coarse Pitch field, enter the number of semitones you want to transpose the clip by. A negative number in the Coarse
Pitch field transposes a clip down. A positive number in the Coarse Pitch field transposes the clip up.

Working with REX files
Cakewalk supports two types of Groove Clips:

 ACIDized Groove Clip
 REX-based Groove Clip
Like ACIDized WAVE files, REX files are audio files that are designed to be looped and follow the project’s tempo. The time
stretching technology that REX files use is well suited for percussive sounds, such as drums.
You can import REX files into a Cakewalk project. Once imported, you can work with REX files just as if they were regular Groove
Clips (see “Working with Groove Clip audio” on page 806).
Note: REX-based Groove Clips can be edited in the Loop Construction view, but certain Loop Construction view tools only apply
to ACIDized Groove Clips. The following Loop Construction view commands, settings and tools do not apply to REX files:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Enable Looping
Beats in Clip
Enable Stretching
Marker tools
Slice Resolution
Transient Detection

To import a REX file
1. On the File menu, point to Import and click Audio.
The Import Audio dialog box appears.
2. In the Files of type list, select All Audio or REX (*.rex, *.rx2, *.rcy).
3. Find and select the REX file you want to import.
If you want to preview the selected file, click Play. The file will play at the current project tempo.
4. Click Open.
The REX file is imported into Cakewalk as a Groove Clip.
You can also drag REX files into Cakewalk, paste from the Clipboard, or import from the Media Browser view.

To disable looping of a REX-based Groove Clip
If you want to disable looping of REX based Groove Clips, use the Track view Clips > Bounce to Clip(s) command or click the
track’s Freeze button render the REX based Groove Clip to a standard audio clip.
For details, see “Bouncing to clips” on page 936 and “Freeze tracks and synths” on page 1006.

To use pitch markers with REX-based Groove Clips
Unlike ACIDized audio loops, REX files do not store the original pitch (root note) value. If you want a pitched REX file to properly
follow your project’s pitch markers, you must manually specify the original root note for each REX clip. By default, Cakewalk assigns
a root note value of G#.
Due to limitations of the REX file format, the root note value can not be saved back to the REX file, and must be manually specified
each time you import a REX file into a Cakewalk project. If you want to permanently save the root note value with a REX loop, export
the REX Groove clip as an ACIDized .wav file.
For details, see Root Note and “Saving Groove Clips as Wave files/ACIDized Wave files” on page 810.

Working with Groove Clip audio

MIDI Groove Clips
MIDI Groove clips are MIDI clips that you can roll out like audio Groove clips, and you can also choose to have Cakewalk transpose
MIDI Groove clips when your project reaches a pitch marker.
You can change any MIDI clip into a MIDI Groove clip (or back into a regular MIDI clip) by right-clicking the clip and choosing
Groove-Clip Looping on the pop-up menu. A MIDI clip that has its Groove clip feature activated appears with beveled edges in the
Clips pane.
Here are some other features of MIDI Groove clips:

 You can roll out copies in either direction (just like audio Groove clips). The Snap to Grid setting determines what beat boundaries
(if any) you can roll to.

 You can edit individual repetitions without altering any other copies (unlike audio Groove clips).
Note: If you then roll the edge of your MIDI Groove clip back over the area you edited, you will lose your edits.

 All new repetitions are based on the first clip (just like audio Groove clips). However, if you split a repetition from its original source
clip, the repetition becomes independent: if you copy this clip, Cakewalk treats it as an original clip.

 You can import MIDI Groove clips from the Import MIDI dialog box, the Media Browser view, and by dragging and dropping from
the Windows Explorer.

 You can preview MIDI Groove clips in the Import MIDI dialog box.
 You can edit MIDI Groove clips wherever you can edit regular MIDI clips.
For step-by-step information, see the following procedures, and also “Exporting and importing MIDI Groove clips” on page 814.
See:
“To enable or disable a MIDI clip’s Groove Clip function” on page 813
“To create repetitions of a MIDI Groove Clip” on page 813

To enable or disable a MIDI clip’s Groove Clip function
 Select the clip and press CTRL+L.
Or

 Right-click the clip and choose Groove Clip Looping from the pop-up menu.
A MIDI clip that has its Groove clip feature activated appears with beveled edges in the Clips pane.

To create repetitions of a MIDI Groove Clip
1. Set the Snap value if you want the clip to repeat at precise time boundaries.
2. Move the cursor over the end or beginning of the clip until the cursor looks like this
. When the cursor changes, click the end
or beginning of the clip and drag it to the right (if you are dragging out from the end) or left (if you are dragging from the
beginning).
The clip repeats itself until you stop dragging.

2. Open the Clip Properties Inspector’s Groove Clip section and adjust the Pitch (semitones) field. Choose the number of halfsteps you want to transpose the clip by: choose negative numbers to transpose down, or positive numbers to transpose up.
Either method transposes the original clip and all repetitions. The original clip displays a positive or negative number in parentheses
showing any transposition value you’ve added to the clip.
If you use pitch markers to transpose a clip, any transposition value you add to the clip by the above two methods changes the final
pitch by whatever transposition value you’ve added.

To transpose a MIDI Groove Clip with pitch markers
Use the same method you use for audio Groove clips: see “Using pitch markers in the Track view” on page 811.

Editing MIDI events and continuous controllers (CC)

Cakewalk lets you edit the events in your projects in dozens of different ways. The Piano Roll view lets you add and edit notes,
controllers, and automation data interactively, using a graphic display. Cakewalk’s many editing commands can improve the quality
of recorded performances, filter out certain types of events, and modify the tempos and dynamics of your projects. The Event List
view lets you see and modify every detail of your project. Finally, you can apply a variety of effects and filters to enhance your MIDI
data.
Note: For a basic overview over MIDI data, please see “MIDI” on page 222.

To specify the default editing view for MIDI clips
Cakewalk provides several views you can use to edit MIDI data. You can specify which editing view should open by default when
you double-click a MIDI clip. To do so, click the Track view Options menu, point to Click Behavior > Double-Click > MIDI Clips,
and select the desired default editing view. The options are as follows:

 -Nothing-. Prevent any view from opening when you double-click a MIDI clip.
 Clip Properties. Open the Clip Properties Inspector when you double-click a MIDI clip.
 Event List View. Open the Event List view when you double-click a MIDI clip.
 Staff View. Open the Staff view when you double-click a MIDI clip.
 Piano Roll View. Open the Piano Roll view when you double-click a MIDI clip.
 Inline Piano Roll View. Open the Inline Piano Roll view when you double-click a MIDI clip.
You can override the default editing view and assign a specific editing view to each MIDI clip. To do so, click the MIDI Editor indicator
in the top right corner of the MIDI clip, then choose the desired editing view on the pop-up menu.

The Piano Roll view
The Piano Roll view displays all notes and other events from one or more MIDI tracks in a grid format that looks much like a player
piano roll. Notes are displayed as horizontal bars, and drum notes as diamonds. Pitch runs from bottom to top, with the left vertical
margin indicating the pitches as piano keys or note names. Time is displayed running left to right with vertical measure and beat
boundaries. The Piano Roll view makes it easy to add, edit, and delete notes from a track.
A single-track version of the Piano Roll view is available in each track in the Track view. This view is called the Inline Piano Roll view,
and replaces the Clips pane in any track that you choose to display in Inline Piano Roll mode.

Editing notes with the global tools
You can edit notes in the Piano Roll view and the Inline Piano Roll view with the same methods. The Smart tool, Freehand tool and
Select tool are useful for quick note editing. You can do the same edits with commands in the Process menu (Length, Slide,
Transpose). If you want to edit multiple notes at the same time, first select them with the Select tool.
MIDI notes display their velocity value as a wide or narrow column. You can drag the column up or down to edit the note’s velocity.
Holding the Smart tool over the middle of the note in the upper third of the note displays a small velocity column on the Smart tool to
show that the tool is in the target zone.
A

C

A. Smart tool in velocity-edit mode B. Tooltip showing cursor position C. Velocity column

Tooltips give you a constant readout of the cursor position, how much you’ve edited the selection, and how many notes you’re
editing.
In the following figure, the tooltip lists the current location of the cursor, how far the selection has moved from its original location
(1252 ticks to the right), the current pitch level and MIDI note number of the cursor (E8 100), how far from the note’s original pitch the
cursor has moved (1 half-step higher), and how many notes are in the selection.

To adjust a MIDI note’s velocity
1. Set the track’s Edit Filter control to Notes.
2. Do one of the following:

Note event colors based on velocity
By default, note events in the Piano Roll are colorized based on velocity. Darker shades of the basic track color indicate higher
velocities. Lighter shades of the basic track color indicate lower velocities.
This behavior can be bypassed by adding the following INI variable to the WinCake section of Cakewalk.ini (see “Cakewalk.ini”
on page 1461):
PRVColorizeVelocity=0

Piano Roll lasso behavior
By default, lasso selecting the top of velocity lines in the Piano Roll's Note pane does not automatically select the corresponding
note events. If you want velocity lines to affect note selection, you can change the behavior by adding a switch to the Windows
registry.
Warning: Always back up the Windows registry before making any changes. Only edit the registry if you are comfortable doing
so.
1. Click the Start button and select Run.
2. Type regedit and click OK to open the Registry Editor.
3. Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Cakewalk Music Software\Cakewalk\Core.
4. Add a new DWORD value called AllowLassoVelInNotesPane (click Edit > New > DWORD Value).
5. Double-click the new AllowLassoVelInNotesPane DWORD event to open the Edit DWORD Value dialog box, then change the
value to 1 (0=OFF; 1=ON).
6. Click OK to close the Edit DWORD Value dialog box, then restart Cakewalk.
Note: If you are showing velocity lines in the Piano Roll Controller pane, you can still lasso select velocity lines to select the
corresponding note events. The above registry setting only affects the Note pane in the Piano Roll and Inline Piano Roll.

Piano Roll view snap resolution
The Piano Roll view can use its own optional and independent Snap to Grid resolution, separate from the global Snap to Grid
resolution. This allows you, for example, to use a specific resolution when working with clips in the Track view, and a different
resolution when working with note events in the Piano Roll view.
Note: The Inline Piano Roll always obeys the global snap resolution.

The Piano Roll view always obeys the global Snap to Grid on/off setting, even if you specify an independent snap resolution in the
Piano Roll view. The Snap settings in the Piano Roll view only apply to the snap resolution, not whether Snap to Grid is on or off.

To enable/disable independent Piano Roll view Snap resolution
1. In the Piano Roll view, click the Snap to Grid button
The Snap to Grid button is lit

, which is located to the right of the menu bar.

Show velocity on selected notes (optional)
Cakewalk has an option to show velocities for selected Note events. This option makes it easier to see and edit velocities when
many Note events are present. It also makes it easier to change the velocity for individual Note events that are stacked (such as
chords).
If there is no selection, velocities are shown for all Note events.

To only show velocity for selected note events
Click the Piano Roll view Notes menu and choose Show Velocity on Selected Notes Only.
The state of the Show Velocity on Selected Notes option is saved with the project, and the setting is separate for the Piano Roll
view and Inline Piano Roll.

Selection sensitive velocity drawing
If any Note events are selected, velocity painting will only affect those selected Note events. If no Note events are selected, then
velocity painting will affect all Note events.

Example 1. Painting velocity when some Note events are selected. Only those Note events are changed.

Example 2. Painting velocity when no Note events are selected. All Note events are changed.

See:

Adding and editing controllers in the Piano Roll
Controller events (MIDI continuous controllers, pitch wheel, NRPNs, and RPNs) appear in either the Notes pane or the Controller
pane, depending on whether you choose to display the Controller pane or not. Each controller event has a tail, which graphically
demonstrates the controller event’s current value. The tail changes colors to show whether you can edit a particular type of
controller, and also turns dark to show that the controller event is selected. Controller events appear in different colors so you can
differentiate them when you’re displaying multiple controller events, possibly in multiple tracks.
Note: Only the current track and current events appear in a solid color. All other tracks and events appear in de-saturated
colors.
A

B

A. A single controller event B. Controller tail

To show which events belong to which track, and which ones are the “current” events (the ones you can edit), and which events are
selected, controller events use the following color patterns:

 Controller tail. Color is strong when the controller is selected in the track’s Edit Filter. Color is dimmed when another controller
type has focus.

 Selected. If a controller event is selected, the tail darkens in shade the way that selected notes do.

Working with MIDI data lanes
The Controller pane allows you to display and edit non-note MIDI data, such as velocity, modulation, pitch bend and continuous
controllers (CCs), in multiple lanes at the bottom of the Piano Roll view.
When you open the Piano Roll view, Cakewalk will automatically create a separate MIDI data lane for each unique data type that is
present in the selected track(s).
While the Track pane can show multiple event types simultaneously, each MIDI data lane displays only a single event type. MIDI
data lanes allow you to easily show only the parameters you are interested in, without cluttering up the interface with numerous
overlapping events.
MIDI data lanes cannot be reordered or resized. The height of all MIDI data lanes is determined by the height of the Controller pane.
See:
“To assign an Event Type to a lane” on page 845

the following priority list:
1. Velocity
2. Continuous Controllers (same order as in the MIDI Event Type dialog box)
3. Wheel
4. Channel Aftertouch, starting from channel 1
5. RPN
6. NRPN
If no event types exist in the track, the MIDI Event Type dialog box appears, which lets you specify the desired event type.

To delete a lane
To delete an existing lane, click the Minus button

in the top left corner of the lane.

The button is not available if there is only one lane open. To remove the last lane, simply hide the Controller pane (click the Piano

2. Select the time range that contain the controller data you want to convert, or clear the selection if you want to convert the entire
envelope.
3. Right-click envelope and select Convert to MIDI Events.
Conversion uses the current Snap to Grid setting as a resolution for discrete CC events:

 If Snap is off, the resolution is the last selected snap setting.
 If Snap is not set to a musical value (e.g. samples), the resolution is 1/32nd note.

Adding controllers
When you add a new controller type to a track, the controller type is automatically chosen in the Show/Hide MIDI Events menu, so
that you can see it. For help showing and hiding all the other MIDI data you may have in your track or tracks, see “Displaying notes
and controllers in the Inline Piano Roll view” on page 860, “Displaying notes and controllers (Piano Roll view only)” on page 832, and
“Working with multiple tracks in the Piano Roll view” on page 823.

To add controller data with the Freehand tool
1. Click the controller lane’s Event Filter and choose New Value Type to open the MIDI Event Type dialog box.
2. Choose options from the following fields:

 Type. Choose the type of controller you want to add (for example, choose Control if you want to edit volume).
 Value. This field is grayed-out if you choose Wheel or ChanAft in the Type field. If you choose Control, RPN, or NRPN in
the Type field, choose which Control, RPN, or NRPN you want to add. For example, to edit volume, choose 7-Volume in this
field if you chose Control in the Type field.

 Channel. Choose a MIDI channel for the controller if you want. If your track has a MIDI channel listed in the Ch field, all MIDI
data in your track uses the listed MIDI channel.
3. Click OK to close the dialog box.
4. Select the Freehand tool

in the Control Bar, and add your controller values by using one of the following methods:

 Depress the mouse at the point where you want your controller messages to start, and drag the Draw tool to draw the kind of
curve you want your controller messages to follow. A tooltip appears when you depress the mouse, and constantly reports the
controller name, channel, value, and location of the controller value that you are entering. Release the mouse where you want
your curve to end.
Tip: To draw a straight line, hold the SHIFT key down while you draw.

 To add one controller event at a time, click each place that you want to add a controller value. A tooltip appears when you
click, and reports the controller name, channel, value, and location of the controller value that you are entering.
The controller events you added appear as vertical lines. Each different type of controller event appears with a different color (see
“Adding and editing controllers in the Piano Roll” on page 843 for more information).
When you use the Draw tool, the speed with which you drag the mouse determines the density of controller events. To insert a larger
number of controller events with relatively small changes in value, move the mouse slowly. To insert a smaller number of controller
events with relatively large changes in value, drag the mouse quickly.

To insert a series of controllers
1. Choose Insert > Series of Controllers to display the Insert Series of Controllers dialog box.
2. Choose the controller type from the Insert list.
3. Choose the controller number or type from the Number list.
4. Use the spinners or enter the desired MIDI channel.
5. Enter a starting and ending value in the Begin and End boxes.
6. Enter a starting and ending time in the From and Thru boxes.
7. Click OK when you are done.

Cakewalk inserts a series of controller events with values that change smoothly over time from the starting to the ending value
indicated in the dialog box. This command never inserts more than one event on the same clock tick. If any controllers of the type
you have selected already exist in the time region, Cakewalk deletes these before inserting the new ones.
See:
“Selecting controllers” on page 848

Selecting controllers
To perform many editing procedures on controllers, you first need to select the controller events you want to edit. A selected
controller event turns dark when it is selected. You can select a single controller event, multiple controller events of the same type, or
all controller events.

To select controller events of the same type
1. Click the Edit Filter and select the event type you want to show in the MIDI data lane.
2. Select the Select tool

in the Control Bar, and select one or more controller events by using the following techniques:

 Drag a rectangle around the edit handles of the controller events that you want to select.
 SHIFT-click or SHIFT-drag to add other controllers to the selection.
 CTRL-click to or CTRL-drag toggle the selection state of a controller.
 Click and drag in the Time Ruler.

Select controllers within note duration
When editing MIDI data it is often necessary to align the timing of Controller events with that of Note events. For example, Sustain
Pedal (CC64) events need to move along with the notes they are supposed to sustain, and Pitch Wheel events need to move along
with the notes whose pitch they are supposed to modify.
When the Select Controllers Along with Notes option is enabled, selecting a Note event or a range of Note events will also
automatically select any Controller events that exist within the time range of the Note event(s).
Note events can be selected by clicking the notes or by lasso-selecting the notes. For more information, see “Selecting notes” on
page 833.
The following rules apply when multiple Note / Controller event types are selected:

 Dragging a Note event vertically will not affect the selected Controller event(s).
 Dragging a Note event in time (horizontally) will also drag the Controller event(s) along with it in time.
 Dragging Controller events vertically will not affect the selected Note event(s).
 Dragging Controller events in time will also drag Note events along with them in time.
 If multiple Controller types are selected, only the type you click on can be dragged vertically. The rest will only move in time
(horizontally).

To enable/disable ‘Select Controllers within Note Duration’
Click the Piano Roll view Controllers menu and choose Select Controllers Along With Notes.

Note: The state of the Select Controllers Along With Notes option is global and applies to both the Piano Roll view and Inline
Piano Roll.

Transform modes
The Transform tool has several modes that can be selected by right-clicking the Transform button:

 Soft mode

. When Soft mode is enabled, the Transform tool will produce a smooth transition between continuous controller
events that exist inside and outside the bounding box. You can control the width of the transition by dragging the Soft Transform
handles. Soft mode prevents abrupt and drastic changes between edits when using the Transform tool. When Soft mode is
enabled, the Transform tool bounding box is drawn with round corners. For details, see “Using Soft mode” on page 853.

 Mask mode

. When Mask mode is enabled, you can only edit continuous controller events that appear inside the bounding
box. This is very useful, for example, if you want to focus on continuous controller events that are tied to the selected Note event,
without accidentally modifying other surrounding continuous controller events. For details, see “Using Mask mode” on page 854.

 Auto Focus

. When Auto Focus is enabled, the Transform tool bounding box follows the current selection, and automatically
encloses any continuous controller events that overlap the selected time range. For details, see “Using Auto Focus” on page 854.

 Auto Focus (Monophonic)

. Auto Focus (Monophonic) is similar to Auto Focus, except it only focuses continuous controller
events up to the next Note event. This mode is meant to be used with legato/monophonic material, and only applies if the selected
Note event and next Note event overlap by 50% or less. For details, see “Using Auto Focus (Monophonic)” on page 855.
Tip: Auto Focus is very useful when using the TAB and SHIFT+TAB shortcuts to jump to the next or previous Note event.

Note: When using Auto Focus and Mask mode together, the bounding box automatically extends the full height of the Controller
pane so you can draw events with any max value.
To select a mode, do one of the following:

 Click the Transform tool button and keep the mouse button pressed for a brief moment, then select the desired mode on the popup menu.

 Right-click the Transform tool button and select the desired mode on the pop-up menu.
Figure 391. Right-click the Transform button to select a mode.

Using the Transform tool
When you select the Transform tool, a bounding box appears in the Controller pane. You can move and resize the bounding box to
enclose the continuous controller events you want to modify. The bounding box has 9 handles that each perform a different
transformation (6 handles when editing velocities). When positioned over a handle, the mouse pointer becomes a double arrow.
Drag the bounding box handles to easily ramp, stretch, flex, and scale the enclosed continuous controller events.
If you change your mind while dragging a handle, press the ESC key to cancel the operation.

To select continuous controller events for editing
1. Select the Transform tool to show the bounding box in the Controller pane.
2. Use any combination of the following gestures to enclose the continuous controller events you want to edit:

 To redraw the bounding box. Drag outside the bounding box with the right mouse button.
 To resize the bounding box. Drag any bounding box edge (not a handle), or drag a corner with the right mouse button.
 To move the bounding box. Drag inside the bounding box with the right mouse button.

Tip: To shrink-wrap the top and bottom of the bounding box around the selected controllers, double-click the top or bottom bounding
box line (not on a handle).

Using Soft mode
The Transform tool can be used in either the default (Hard) mode, or in Soft mode. Each mode controls how transformed events
interact with nearby data.
By default, the Transform tool is very precise and produces hard edges at the left/right edit locations. Soft mode allows the
Transform tool to produce a smooth transition at the left/right edit locations.
Soft mode prevents abrupt and drastic changes at the bounding box edges, and you can control the width of the transition by
dragging the Soft mode handles.
To enable Soft mode, do one of the following:

 Select the Transform tool and click the Soft mode toggle in the top left corner of the bounding box.
 Right-click the Transform button and select Soft Mode on the pop-up menu.
When Soft mode is enabled, the bounding box is drawn with round corners.

Using Mask mode
When Mask mode
is enabled, you can only edit continuous controller events that appear inside the bounding box. This allows
you to focus on continuous controller events that are tied to the selected Note event, without accidentally modifying other
surrounding continuous controller events.
To enable Mask Mode mode, right-click the Transform button and select Mask Mode on the pop-up menu. When enabled, the
Controller pane background is dimmed outside the bounding box.

Note: When using Auto Focus and Mask mode together, the bounding box automatically extends the full height of the Controller
pane so you can draw events with any max value.
Figure 394. In Mask mode you can only draw inside the bounding box.

Using Auto Focus
When Auto Focus
is enabled, the Transform tool bounding box follows the current selection, and automatically encloses any
continuous controller events that overlap the selected time range. This is very useful when using the TAB and SHIFT+TAB shortcuts
to jump to the next or previous Note event, especially when used in conjunction with Mask mode

.

To enable Auto Focus, right-click the Transform button and select Auto Focus on the pop-up menu.

Note: When using Auto Focus and Mask mode together, the bounding box automatically extends the full height of the Controller
pane so you can draw events with any max value.

Editing MIDI events and continuous controllers (CC)
Adding and editing controllers in the Piano Roll

Using Auto Focus (Monophonic)
Note events can often overlap slightly when recording legato and monophonic material. In such situations, it is usually desirable to
only transform continuous controller events that extend up to the next Note event, instead of the full duration of the selected Note
event. Auto Focus (Monophonic)
allows you to do this easily. Auto Focus (Monophonic) is similar to Auto Focus, except it only
focuses continuous controller events up to the next Note event.
If the selected Note event overlaps other Note events, the bounding box will extend to the first Note event that overlaps by 50% or
less, otherwise it will extend the full duration of the selected Note event.
To enable Auto Focus (Monophonic), right-click the Transform button and select Auto Focus (Monophonic) on the pop-up menu.

Piano Roll Microscope mode
The Piano Roll Microscope mode makes it much easier to edit MIDI data without constantly needing to change zoom settings. This
is especially useful in the Inline Piano Roll where track heights are typically sized such that MIDI notes become very small.
When Microscope mode is enabled, a transparent rounded square centered on the mouse cursor shows a zoomed in region of the
Piano Roll data underneath it:

Only the work area under the mouse is zoomed in while the rest of the data retains its normal size.
Here is an example of dense MIDI data that is difficult to edit at the current zoom level:

With Microscope mode turned on, the area under the mouse looks like this:

Microscope mode also works with Drum Maps:

To enable/disable Microscope mode
To enable/disable Microscope mode, do one of the following:

 Click the Piano Roll view View menu and choose MIDI Microscope.
 Click the Track view View menu and choose MIDI Microscope.
 Go to Edit > Preferences > Customization - Editing and select the Microscope check box.

856

Editing MIDI events and continuous controllers (CC)
Adding and editing controllers in the Piano Roll

How Microscope mode works
Position. The Microscope is always centered on the mouse position.
Size. The size of the Microscope is configurable. The default diameter is 100 pixels. See “Configuring Microscope mode options”
on page 857 for more information.
Transparency. The Microscope maintains a certain level of transparency so that the real-sized data can always be seen.
Zoom Factor (vertical). The amount of vertical zoom varies with the existing zoom level of the data. Generally, the note height
under the microscope has a minimum height of 8 pixels and scales up from there depending on the existing zoom of the data. The
microscope data will always be bigger than the original regardless of how far it is zoomed in.
Zoom Factor (horizontal/time). The microscope will provide some horizontal magnification when the view zoom is such that
notes become very narrow.
Tip: Use Fast Zoom in combination with Microscope mode if you want to quickly zoom around the current mouse position. See “To
zoom using the mouse wheel (Fast Zoom)” on page 493 for more details.

Configuring Microscope mode options
There are several settings that let you configure the size and zoom level of the microscope.
To Configure Microscope Mode Options
Go to Edit > Preferences > Customization - Editing.

The following options are available:
Microscope.

Use this check box to enable/disable Microscope mode (enabled by default).

Diagonal Size. Use this numeric entry box to specify the diameter size in pixels of the microscope. The valid range is 20-250 and
the default value is 100.
Show When Note Height Less Than. Microscope mode will only be enabled if the note heights (in pixels) are equal or less than
this number. The valid range is 2-20 and the default value is 6.
Magnifying Time. Use this check box to enable/disable horizontal magnification when the Piano Roll view zoom is such that notes
become very narrow.
In addition to these options, there are some other parameters that can be configured by adding the following INI variables to the
WinCake section of Cakewalk.ini (see “Cakewalk.ini” on page 1461):

Variable

Type

Default value What it does

MicroscopeHZoomThreshold=<1..20>

Integer

8

By default, the Microscope mode begins horizontal
magnification when a 32nd note is narrower than 8 pixels.
This line lets you specify the horizontal zoom threshold
(1-20 pixels).

MicroscopeHZoomMax=<2.0 - 8.0>

Integer

3.0

This line specifies the highest horizontal magnification
that will result when using Microscope mode.

Selecting and editing events
Cakewalk has many editing commands that you can use to modify the events that make up your project. Here are some of the things
you can do:

 Transpose events, clips, tracks, or an entire project to a different key
 Shift events to an earlier or later time
 Stretch or shrink material to a different length
 Reverse the notes in a clip to create new arrangements
 Modify the note velocities
The following sections describe these editing commands and how to use them. Cakewalk also has some special commands you can
use to modify or clean up a performance or to search for or select events that meet certain criteria.
See:
“Transposing” on page 863
“Shifting events in time” on page 863

3. Select the notes you want to move or copy (see “To select MIDI notes” on page 638). It is not necessary to make a selection if
you only want to move/copy a single note.
4. Do one of the following:

 To move notes to the active track. Hold down the ALT key and right-click any selected note.
 To move notes to a different position in the active track. Hold down the ALT key a drag any selected note with the right
mouse button. Tip: Hold down ALT+SHIFT to restrict vertical or horizontal movement.

 To copy notes to the active track. Hold down CTRL+ALT and right-click any selected note.
 To copy notes to a different position in the active track. Hold down CTRL+ALT a drag any selected note with the right
mouse button. Tip: Hold down CTRL+ALT+SHIFT to restrict vertical or horizontal movement.

Tip: If you prefer to always paste copied notes into the active track, click the Piano Roll view Notes menu and select Always Paste
Copied Notes into Active Track. This allows you to copy notes to the active track without having to the use the ALT key.

Tip: When Auto Lock is disabled and using the Smart tool
to lasso select notes, you can temporarily limit selection to the active
track only. This prevents unintended selection of notes in other tracks. To do so, hold down the SHIFT key while dragging with the right
mouse button. Only notes in the active track will be selected.

862

Editing MIDI events and continuous controllers (CC)
Selecting and editing events

Transposing
The Process > Transpose command transposes the pitches of selected note events up or down by a fixed number of steps. It does
so by changing the MIDI key numbers of note events. Simply enter the number of half-steps—a negative number to transpose down,
a positive number to transpose up.
Cakewalk can also perform diatonic transposition, which shifts all the notes up and down the major scale of the current signature by
the designated number of steps. For instance, if you specify an amount of +1 and the key signature is C-major, a C becomes a D (up
a whole step), an E becomes an F (up a half step), and so on. Diatonic transposition assures you that the transposed notes fit with
the original key signature.
As an option, you can choose to transpose selected audio clips along with any selected MIDI clips. Cakewalk uses pitch-shifting (a
plug in for changing audio pitch) to perform the transposition. You can transpose audio only a single octave in either direction (-12 to
+12), and you cannot transpose audio when you are using diatonic transposition.

To transpose selected events
1. Select the tracks, clips, or events you want to transpose.
2. Choose Process > Transpose to display the Transpose dialog box
Figure 398. The Transpose dialog box.

3. Use the spinners or enter the number of semi-tones to transpose.
Or
Use the + and - keys on your keypad to go up or down by one or [ and ] to go up or down by octaves.
4. Check Diatonic Math if you want to transpose along the major scale of the current key.
5. Choose Transpose Audio if you want to pitch-shift selected audio clips. If you select this check box. Cakewalk transposes any
selected audio data up or down, but only by half-steps, not diatonically. When this check box is enabled, the following option
become available:

 Type. Choose the type of audio data you're transposing. Choose options based on the source material: single voice or
instrument versus a group of instruments (ensemble or polyphonic), and how long you want to wait for processing to finish:
better quality can take a long time if you're processing several tracks.
6. Click OK when you are done.
Cakewalk transposes the selected events.

Shifting events in time
The Track view lets you move entire clips forward or backward in time by using drag and drop editing or by changing the start time of
selected clips. The Process > Slide command is slightly more flexible—you can use it to shift individual events and markers (or
selected events and markers) either forward or backward in time. This has an effect that is similar to the Time+ parameter in the
Track view. However, the Process > Slide command modifies the time stored with each event, while the Time+ parameter simply
applies a temporary change during playback.
You can also use the Process > Slide command to move markers located within the selection. If you have selected any locked
markers, Cakewalk will ask whether they should slide, too.

To shift events in time
1. Select the events and/or markers you want to shift.
2. Choose Process > Slide to display the Slide dialog box.
3. Check the types of event you want to slide (events and/or markers).
4. Enter the number of measures, ticks, seconds, frames or samples to slide. Enter a negative number to shift material earlier. Note
that you cannot slide any event earlier than 1:01:000. For example, if the current selection starts at 2:01:000, you cannot slide
events earlier by more than one measure.
5. Click OK when you are done.
Cakewalk shifts the selected events and/or markers. You can also use the Process > Nudge command to move events. See
“Nudge” on page 510 for more information.

Inserting time or measures into a project
The Project > Insert Time/Measures command lets you insert any number of blank measures, ticks, seconds, or frames into a
project. You can insert the blank measures (or other period of time) into all tracks or into one or more selected tracks. If you insert the
blank time into the entire project, all events in each track—markers, meter and key settings, and tempo changes—are shifted
automatically by default. If you insert the blank time into one or more selected tracks, only the events in those tracks are shifted by
default. You can always choose which types of events should be shifted.

To insert a single blank measure into a project
1. Press CTRL+SHIFT+A or select Edit > Select > None to make sure that no track or time range is selected.
2. Set the Now time to the place where you want to insert the measure.
3. Choose Project > Insert Time/Measures to display the Insert Time/Measures dialog box.

Deleting measures or time from one or more tracks
There are two methods for deleting time or measures:

 If there is any audio or MIDI data in the area you want to delete, you can use the Edit > Delete command to delete the area that
you select. Portions of MIDI clips may have no data in them: they have boundaries but no dark lines inside—if that’s the case, use
the following method.

 If there is no data in the area you want to delete, you can simply drag any clips that come after the empty area to their proper
destinations. You can also use this method if there is data in the area you want to delete—you just have to choose whether you
want to replace the data in the deleted area, blend it with the data you’re moving, or slide it over to make room.
To delete time when there is audio or MIDI data in the area you want to delete:
1. In the Track view, select the track(s) you want to delete measures or time from by doing one of the following:

 Select a single track by clicking the track number.
 Select multiple tracks by CTRL-clicking the track numbers.
2. Set the Snap to Grid value to the unit of time you want to delete. For example, if you want to delete whole measures, set the
Snap to Grid value to a whole measure.
3. In the Clips pane, select the measures or time you want to delete by dragging in the Time Ruler located just above the first track.
4. Select Edit > Delete Special.
The Delete dialog box appears.
5. Click the following check boxes:

 Events in Tracks
 Delete Hole. If you want the data that comes after the hole to retain its same placement in a measure, select the Shift by
Whole Measures check box.
6. Click any of the other options you want to delete.
7. Click OK.
Cakewalk deletes the time or measures you selected.
To delete time when there is no audio or MIDI data in the area you want to delete (or if there is data, but you like to drag and drop):
1. Set the Snap to Grid value to the unit of time you want to delete. For example, if you want to delete whole measures, set the
Snap to Grid value to a whole measure.
2. In the Track view, select the clips you want to move.
3. Drag one of the selected clips to its proper destination—the Drag and Drop Options dialog box appears.
4. Choose options and click OK.
All the selected clips move by the amount that you dragged the mouse.

Stretching and shrinking events
The Process > Length and Process > Fit to Time commands can be used to stretch or shrink a portion of a project. Process >
Length lets you stretch or shrink the selection by a fixed percentage and makes the adjustment by altering the individual events. A
value of 200 percent, for example, stretches the selection to twice its original length, while a value of 50 percent shrinks the selection
to half its original length.
Process > Fit to Time stretches or shrinks the selection so that it ends at a specific time, expressed in either Measure:Beat:Tick
(MBT) or Hours:Minutes:Seconds:Frames (SMPTE) format. This command gives you a choice of modifying the events or modifying
the underlying tempo. This is useful when you want a portion of a project to have an exact length. The start time of the selection
does not change, but the end time is altered as necessary to fit the required time interval.
Both of these commands offer the option to stretch audio clips along with the MIDI information. Sometimes you don’t want to adjust
the speed of your audio.
Here are some examples:

 If your project contains background music and a voice-over, you might want to change the tempo of the background music without
altering the voice-over

 If you’re trying to modify the speed of some MIDI tracks to match a sampled drum groove, you want to leave the audio unchanged
 If your audio consists solely of sound effects, you most likely do not want to adjust them
Audio can be stretched or condensed up to a factor of 4 (e.g., it can be shrunk to as little as 25 percent of its original length, or
expanded to as much as 400 percent of its original length).
You can also use the Process > Length command to alter only the start times or the durations of notes. For example, changing the
durations of notes to 50 percent of their original length can create a staccato effect.

To stretch or shrink using percentages
1. Select the events you want to change.
2. Choose Process > Length to display the Length dialog box.

To stretch MIDI clips
1. Set the track’s Edit Filter control to Clips.
2. Do one of the following:

 With the Smart tool

, hold down CTRL+SHIFT and position the pointer over the clip’s first half and drag to stretch the
beginning, or position the pointer over the clip’s second half and drag to stretch the end.

 With the Stretch tool

, position the pointer over the clip’s first half and drag to stretch the beginning, or position the pointer
over the clip’s second half and drag to stretch the end.

 With the Edit tool

, hold down CTRL+SHIFT and position the pointer over the clip’s first half and drag to stretch the
beginning, or position the pointer over the clip’s second half and drag to stretch the end.

The clip edge turns yellow to indicate the clip will be stretched when you drag.
While dragging, a clip icon in the top right corner of the clip shows the stretch percentage (25% to 400%).

Note: You cannot stretch MIDI Groove clips. If you want to stretch a MIDI Groove clip, you must first either disable the clip’s
Groove Clip Looping property (select the clip and press CTRL+L) or bounce the Groove clip to a new regular MIDI clip (use
the Track view Clips > Bounce to Clip(s) command).

To stretch Note events
You can stretch the duration of all selected notes in the Piano Roll view and Inline Piano Roll.
1. Set the track’s Edit Filter control to Notes.
2. Select the Note events you want to stretch. For details, see “To select MIDI notes” on page 638.
3. Do one of the following:

 To stretch all notes proportionally. With the Smart tool

, position the pointer where you want to split the note, then hold

down the CTRL key and drag the end of any selected note.

 To stretch all notes to the same absolute duration. With the Smart tool

, position the pointer where you want to split

the note, then hold down the SHIFT key and drag the end of any selected note.
Tip: You can easily create tuplets by stretching note events. First draw the desired number of notes, then select them and hold down
the CTRL key while you drag the end of any selected note. For example, draw 5 quarter notes, then stretch them to fit in the space of
4 quarter notes.

Reversing notes in a clip
The Process > Retrograde command reverses the order of events in a selection. If one or more clips are selected, then the events
within each clip are reversed. If several clips are selected from the same track, then the order of the clips is also reversed. You could
use this command, for example, to take a scale or other long run of notes and reverse the order in which they are played. The
Process > Retrograde command does not reverse the contents of audio clips. It only changes their start times. You can use the
Process > Audio > Reverse command to reverse audio clips.

To reverse the sequence of notes or other events
1. Select the notes you want to reverse.
2. Choose Process > Retrograde.
Cakewalk reverses the order of the selected events.

Adding crescendos and decrescendos
The Process > Scale Velocity command lets you create crescendos and decrescendos on those instruments that respond to MIDI
velocity. Most such instruments map changes in velocity to changes in note loudness. Many synthesizer patches alter the timbre of
the sound as well, so that higher velocities produce brighter, as well as louder, sounds. Changes in velocity also affect the playback
of audio clips.
This command lets you set a starting and ending velocity for the entire time range of the selection. Cakewalk scales the velocity of
each event to create a smooth linear change in velocity. As an option, you can enter a starting and ending percentage; existing
velocity values are modified by the designated percentage.
You can also edit note velocities in the Notes pane of the Piano Roll view, which lets you draw shapes other than straight line
changes. For more information, see “Adding and editing notes in the Piano Roll” on page 833.

To scale velocities
1. Select the events whose velocity data you want to change.
2. Choose Process > Scale Velocity to display the Scale Velocity dialog box.

Changing the timing of a recording
When you record a performance, there may be problems you’d like to correct. For example, the note timing may not have been as
accurate as you would like. Or, you may have recorded without using a metronome and strayed from the tempo in one direction or
another.
Cakewalk has two types of commands that you can use to modify the timing of a clip.
The Quantize command alters the timing of the notes in your recording so that they fit a time grid. The grid can have fixed time
intervals or intervals that are based on some existing note pattern.
The Fit to Improvisation command, on the other hand, sets up a series of tempos that fit the material you have recorded. Here’s a
summary of when to use each type of command:

Use this command

To do this

Quantize

Change the timing of the notes you’ve recorded to fit with the tempo of a project

Fit to Improvisation

Change the tempos of a project to fit with the performance you’ve recorded

These two types of commands are discussed in the following topics.
See:
“Quantizing” on page 870
“Fit Improvisation” on page 876

Quantizing
Quantizing is one of the most important editing functions in Cakewalk. You use this feature to correct timing errors you make when
recording from a MIDI instrument or to adjust the timing of audio clips.
Very few musicians are capable of performing in perfect time. As you play, you are likely to strike some notes slightly before or after
the beat or to hold some notes slightly longer than you intended. The Quantize commands can help to correct these types of timing
mistakes.
Cakewalk has two different quantize commands:
Command

How it works

Process > Quantize

Adjusts the start time and duration of selected notes so that they line up with a fixed size grid

Process > Groove Quantize

Lays a grid over an existing piece of music (the groove pattern), and then adjusts the start time, duration, and
velocity of selected notes so that they line up with the grid

These commands have quite a few settings, making them very flexible and powerful. In addition, both of these commands let you
create, save, and re-use presets. This means that once you find the settings you like, you can save them and then apply them to
other projects in a consistent way.

Resolution
The resolution indicates the spacing of the grid. You can use any value from a whole note down to a thirty-second note triplet. You
can also specify resolution in clock ticks. A rule of thumb is to select a resolution that matches the smallest note in the region you are
quantizing. If you are quantizing a run of sixteenth notes, use a sixteenth note as the resolution. If you are quantizing a mix of
sixteenth and eighth notes, you should still use a sixteenth note. At the default timebase of 480 PPQ, 480 clock ticks is equal to
quarter-note resolution.
When you use Groove Quantize, Cakewalk creates a grid at the desired resolution on top of the notes in the groove. For example,
if the groove contains only quarter notes but you choose sixteenth-note resolution, Cakewalk builds the grid by dividing the space
between each quarter note into four equal sections. In places where the groove file contains no notes, Cakewalk builds a fixed grid
of the desired resolution.

870

Editing MIDI events and continuous controllers (CC)
Changing the timing of a recording

Offset
Normally, the resolution grid is aligned evenly with the start of measures and beats. As an option, you can shift the grid earlier or later
by any desired number of clock ticks. If the resolution is a quarter note and you’ve set the offset to +3 ticks, then a note that is
originally near 1:01:000 would be moved to 1:01:003—three ticks beyond the beat boundary.

Duration
As an option, Cakewalk can adjust the duration of note events so that each note ends one clock tick before the start of the nearest
resolution-sized note. This ensures that the notes do not overlap, which can cause problems on some synthesizers. The adjustment
may lengthen the duration of some notes and shorten the duration of others.
When you use Groove Quantize, the duration adjustment compares the note length to the duration of the sample note in the
groove. If no duration information is available, Cakewalk uses the distance to the start of the groove event closest to the end of the
note.

Velocity
The velocity adjustment, which is only available with the Groove Quantize command, adjusts the note velocity to the velocity of the
corresponding notes in the groove.

Strength
The human ear is tuned to the slight “imperfections” we hear from most musicians. If you quantize a project so that all notes are
perfectly in position, it may end up sounding mechanical or rigid. To avoid this, Cakewalk lets you adjust the strength of the
adjustment. A strength of 100 percent indicates that all notes are moved so that they are in perfect time, while a strength of 50
percent means that all notes are moved half-way towards the desired position. This lets you “tighten up” the timing as much as you
want, without going too far.
The Groove Quantize command also lets you control the strength of duration and velocity adjustments. As you work with this
command, you will notice that the note start time has a greater effect than the duration on the rhythmic feel of the track. For this
reason, changing the starting times (time strength close to 100 percent) has a more noticeable effect than changing durations
(duration strength close to 100 percent). However, there are situations in which you might want to change both to avoid ending up
with notes that overlap or with unwanted rests.

Swing
Many projects do not have notes positioned on a perfectly even time grid. For example, projects with a swing feel, though they may
be written entirely in eighth notes, are often played more like eighth-note triplets, with the first note extended and the second one
shortened. The Swing option lets you distort the timing grid so each pair of notes is spaced unevenly, giving the quantized material
a swing feel.
A swing value of 50 percent (the default) means that the grid points are spaced evenly. A value of 66 percent means that the time
between the first and second grid points is twice as long as the time between the second and third points. The following figure
illustrates the effect of the swing setting on the timing grid:

Swing = 50%
Swing = 66%
Swing = 33%

871

Window
When you quantize some portion of a project, you might not want to adjust notes that are very far from the grid. The window, or
sensitivity, setting lets you choose how close to the resolution grid a note must be located for quantize to move it.
A window of 100 percent includes all notes and guarantees that all notes will be shifted to lie exactly on the grid. The window
extends half the resolution distance before and after the quantization point. A window of 50 percent extends only a quarter of the
way toward the adjacent quantization points.
When you use Groove Quantize, you can also perform adjustments on out-of-window events. There are four options:
Option

How it works

Do Not Change

Notes outside the window are not changed.

Quantize to Resolution

Notes outside the window are snapped to a regular grid of the specified resolution.

Move to Nearest

The window or sensitivity setting is ignored—all notes are moved toward the nearest reference event, regardless
of how far off the grid they are located.

Scale Time

Cakewalk finds the two closest events before and after the event in question that are within the window sensitivity
and adjusts any bracketed out-of-window events so that their relative timing is the same. This option can uniformly
speed up, slow down, or shift out-of-window events.

Other settings
If you want, you can restrict the types of events that are affected by the Quantize commands to only notes, lyrics, and audio clips. If
you choose this option, Cakewalk will not modify other events, like controllers.

Defining a groove
To use the groove quantize feature, you must create or choose a small snippet of music—the groove pattern—for Cakewalk to use
as the timing and accent reference. You can use either of the following:

 A track, clip, or portion of a clip stored on the Clipboard
 A groove stored in a Cakewalk groove file
Any MIDI data that you place onto the Clipboard can be used as a groove pattern. With a carefully defined groove pattern, you can
give an old project an entirely new feel. If you like the groove pattern you have created, you can save it to a groove file.
Groove files can store one or more groove patterns. Cakewalk supports two types of groove files:

 DNA™ grooves, which contain only timing information but are compatible with some other MIDI sequencer software products
 Cakewalk’s native groove format, which stores timing, duration, and velocity information and can handle longer patterns and
longer gaps between quantization points
You can add groove patterns to these files from the Clipboard, edit existing patterns, or delete patterns you do not want to keep.
There is no limit to the number of groove patterns that can be stored in a single file. You can organize your grooves into several files
or keep them all together in a single file. Groove files have an extension of .grv.
A groove pattern can be as short or long as you like. If the groove pattern is shorter than the material to be quantized, the pattern will
be repeated as many times as necessary.

To define a new groove
1. Select the music that defines the groove using any of the selection tools and commands.
2. Choose Edit > Copy to place the music onto the Clipboard.
You can now use the Groove Quantize command with the Clipboard as the “Groove File.”

Groove Quantize tips
Here are some tips to help you with groove quantizing:
Aligning sloppy tracks with a good one. Select the portion of the “good” track that you want to apply to the “sloppy” tracks and
copy it to the Clipboard. Select the portion of the sloppy tracks you want to modify. Choose Process > Groove Quantize, choose
the Clipboard as the groove source, and click OK.
Accenting beats in each measure. Create a sample measure containing note events at the desired accent points. Give the notes
on the accented beats a greater velocity and the others a lesser velocity. Select the measure, copy it to the Clipboard, and then
choose Process > Groove Quantize. Set the velocity strength as high as necessary so that the notes get accented the way you
want.
Stealing that feeling. Suppose you have a dry piece that was composed and entered into Cakewalk with a rigid sense of timing
(for example, using step recording). You’ve recorded a bass line that has exactly the off-beat rhythmic dynamic you want for the dry
piece. You’d like to force your other tracks to share that feel. Copy the bass track to the Clipboard; from the Groove Quantize dialog
box, select the Clipboard as the groove source; choose a resolution value roughly on the order of the duration of the bass notes and
a window of 100 percent. Cakewalk aligns the melody note events with the nearest bass notes.
Synchronizing rhythm and solo tracks. If you want to preserve the unique rhythm of each track but want to synchronize them
together in time, try a larger resolution value and a smaller window. For example, suppose you have one track with a highly stylized
drum beat and another track containing a jazz solo with some very nice runs in it. The drum beats fall primarily on quarter notes, but
the solo consists of runs of fast notes that aren’t quite sixteenth triplets. Copy the drum track to the Clipboard, and groove quantize
using a quarter-note resolution and a window of perhaps 10 percent. Cakewalk aligns the solo notes near the quarter-note drum
beats but maintains the feel of the solo during the fast runs of notes in between.
Correcting off-tempo tracks. Suppose you have both rhythm and melody tracks recorded, but the melody was played erratically.
First, copy the rhythm track to the Clipboard. Then use groove quantize with a whole-note resolution, a window of 25 percent or less,
and with the Scale Time option selected. The Groove Quantize command will synchronize the melody track with the groove source
at roughly measure boundaries, while maintaining the relative timing of the notes in each measure.
Fixing a bad verse. Copy a good verse to the Clipboard. Then change the selected range to cover only the bad verse. Perform a
groove quantize using the Clipboard contents as the groove source. The rhythms of the two verses then match.

Fit Improvisation
Cakewalk lets you record music from a MIDI controller without requiring that you use a fixed tempo. In fact, if you record without
using a metronome, you are very likely to end up with a recording that does not fit onto a fixed tempo grid.
The Process > Fit Improvisation command lets you take a recording and create a tempo map (with measure and beat boundaries)
that fits what you played. Your performance is not changed in any way, even though the note start times and durations are adjusted
to fit the new tempo map. This is important if you later want to use any of Cakewalk’s editing features that depend on a proper tempo
map for best results.
To use this command, you must record a reference track containing a single clip that matches your original track or tracks but has
only a single note on each beat boundary. You should make sure that the reference track has one event for every single beat, with
no extra beats or missing beats. The first beat of the reference track should be at 1:01:000. You can use any editing command to
adjust the reference track.
If you want, you can use other types of events as markers on the reference track, such as a sustain pedal. Remember, however, that
MIDI sustain pedals generate one event when the pedal is pressed and another when it is released. So if you want to use the sustain
pedal for the reference track, keep this in mind. Click down, up, down, up, for one, two, three, four.
Remember that the better the quality of your reference track, the better job the Fit Improvisation command can do. You want each
of your reference track events to be as close as possible to the beat of the music. Note that some keyboards transmit aftertouch
events when you record your reference track. These extra events will prevent Process > Fit Improvisation from working properly.
Therefore, you should delete these events before using this command, or filter them out when recording the reference track (using
Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Playback and Recording).

To fit tempos to an improvisation
1. Record the reference track.
2. Select the reference track.
3. If necessary, combine all clips in the reference track into a single clip using the Track view Clips > Bounce to Clip(s) command.
4. Choose Process > Fit Improvisation.
Cakewalk adds tempo changes as necessary to fit the tempo grid to the reference track. When you’re done, you should mute the
reference track, since the reference track events are not rescaled.
Note: If the resulting tempo grid exceeds 250 beats per minute, you will see an error message. If this happens, you can shorten
the start times of each event using the Process > Length command, decrease the tempo to compensate for the change, and
then try again.
You can also use the Set/Measure Beat At Now command to align a freely played MIDI performance with the Time Ruler.

To sync the project tempo to freely played MIDI
If you have recorded a MIDI track without a metronome, you may want to align the project’s tempo map with the MIDI performance.
The Set/Measure Beat At Now command allows you to create new bar lines to fit your project. This command does not stretch
audio. It works by adjusting tempo so that measure lines line up with audio transients or MIDI data. The tempo will ramp up/down
from the previous tempo change in order to arrive at the required tempo.

876

Editing MIDI events and continuous controllers (CC)
Changing the timing of a recording

To use the Set Measure/Beat At Now command, you need to be able to identify where you want to put the downbeats of each
measure, and possibly where you want to place some other beats of the measure, if the tempo varies a lot.
1. Display the MIDI clip that you want the measure/beats to align with in the Inline Piano Roll view: click the MIDI track’s Edit Filter
control and choose Notes. Zoom in enough to see the MIDI data clearly (you can also use the regular Piano Roll view).
Tip: To make it easier to visually align note events with the Time Ruler, drag the MIDI track to the top position so it appears right below
the Time Ruler.

2. If you want other MIDI clips that exist in the project to retain their current M:B:T positions, select the clips, right-click one of them,
and choose Clip Lock > Lock Position from the pop-up menu.
3. Turn off the Snap to Grid button
, and use the Select tool
to click the MIDI clip at the place where you want to set a
measure or beat. The Now Time cursor moves to the place you clicked:

A
A. Now Time cursor

4. Choose Project > Set Measure/Beat at Now to open the Measure Beat/Meter dialog box.

5. Enter the desired measure and beat values, and click OK.
Note: Cakewalk attempts to guess the correct measure/beat, so you usually can just click OK to accept the default values.

6. Move the Now Time to the next desired beat (click the start of the next note).
Tip: Press TAB to jump to the next note, or SHIFT+TAB to jump to the previous note.

7. Choose Project > Set Measure/Beat at Now to open the Measure Beat/Meter dialog box, enter the desired values, and click
OK.
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 until the Time Ruler is correctly aligned.
After you align the Time Ruler to your clip, you can smooth out the tempo changes in the Tempo view, and your clip will retain its
M:B:T position.

Searching for events
The events in a project have many different parameters. For example, all MIDI notes have a channel, starting time, pitch, velocity,
and duration. Controllers have a controller number and value. Cakewalk makes it simple to find, select, and modify events that have
certain values for specific attributes.
Here are some of the things you can do and the commands that you would use to do them:

Action

Command

Select all the events in a project that have the specified attributes

Edit > Select > By Filter

Modify an existing selection to keep only those events that have the specified attributes

Edit > Select > By Filter

Replace all events that meet specified attributes with modified versions of the events

Process > Find/Change

These capabilities can help you find problem spots or errors in a project or make systematic changes to events that have particular
attributes. All of these capabilities rely on the use of an event filter, which lets you choose the types of events you want to work with
and the range of values in which you are interested.
See:
“Event filters” on page 882

Editing MIDI events and continuous controllers (CC)
Searching for events

881

Event filters
When you select individual clips, or select portions of clips by dragging the Time Ruler, you automatically select all the events that
fall within the designated time range. Sometimes you need finer control over which events are selected. For example, you might
want to:

 Select the notes that are played in a certain octave, so you can copy them to another track
 Select and boost the velocity of notes that have a velocity below a certain threshold
 Find the first patch change event on a particular track
 Select and change the duration of all notes that occur on the third beat of any measure
The Event Filter dialog box looks like this:
Figure 408. The Event Filter - Search dialog box.
A

B

A. Check to include this type of event B. Enter the range of values for the events you want

Different types of events have different parameters, as shown in the table:
This event type

Key Aftertouch

Pitch and pressure value

Controller

Controller number and value

RPN/NRPN

RPN/NRPN number and value

Value

The event filter only accepts events that meet all the specified ranges. This means that a note event must fall within the pitch range,
the velocity range, and the duration range in order to be included. The event filter can also be used to accept events that occur in a
range of channel numbers, beats, and clock ticks.

882

Editing MIDI events and continuous controllers (CC)
Searching for events

You can choose either to include or exclude the events that meet the specified criteria. To exclude events within the designated
range and select the ones outside the designated range, select the exc check box for that value range.
The event filter can also be used to identify several special event types: audio, System Exclusive events, Lyrics, MCI commands,
envelope shades, and a few others. You do not enter a range of values for these special events; Cakewalk finds all events of the
types you choose.
The All and None buttons help you set up the event filter the way you want:
Click this button

To do this

All

Set the event filter to include all events. You can then modify the value ranges to narrow down your search or
uncheck the types of events you want to exclude.

None

Set the event filter to not include any events. Starting from a blank slate, you can check off the types of events
you want to find or select and enter the desired ranges of values.

In any place in the event filter where you would normally enter a pitch string, you can also enter the pitch by pressing a key on your
MIDI keyboard. Also, you can use the question mark in place of the octave number as a wild card. This lets the event filter accept a
single note, regardless of the octave. For example, the pitch string C? will match a C in any octave.

Selecting events
The Edit > Select > By Filter command is used to refine a selection by applying an event filter to an initial selection. You can use
this command any number of times to refine the selection even further. Before using this command, use any of the selection
commands and tools to create an initial set of selected event. You can use the Edit > Select > All command to select all events in
the current view.
The Track view cannot display individual selected events. As a result, the Edit > Select > By Filter command will not necessarily
change the appearance of the Track view. Cakewalk applies the event filter rule, but the change is not visible. However, once you
change the selection in any way (for example, by clicking on a track number or by clicking in the Time Ruler), the effects of the event
filter are erased. If you want to use the filter, you must choose Edit > Select > By Filter again and click OK to use the same filter
values.
Note: The shading of a clip in the Track view indicates how many of the events in the clip are selected. If the clip is shown in
solid black, all events in the clip are selected. If a portion of a clip is shown in medium gray, all the events in that time range are
selected. If the clip is shown in light gray, only some of the events in the shaded time range are selected.

To select events using the Event Filter
1. First, select an initial set of tracks, clips, or events.
2. Choose Edit > Select > By Filter to display the Event Filter dialog box.
3. Set up the event filter to find the events you want.
4. Click OK.
Cakewalk searches the currently selected events and weeds out those that do not meet the requirements of the event filter.

Example: splitting left-hand and right-hand parts
Suppose you recorded a keyboard riff on Track 1 but want to split the left and right hands apart into separate tracks so you can edit
them separately. Suppose that all the right-hand notes are above C4. Here’s how to proceed:
1. Select all of Track 1 by clicking on the track number in the Track view.
2. Choose Edit > Select > By Filter to display the Event Filter dialog box.
3. Click the None button to clear the dialog box.
4. Select the Note check box, and enter a minimum value of C4. The maximum should already be set to C9.
5. Click OK. Cakewalk selects all the notes from C4 up.
6. Choose Edit > Cut to move the selected notes to the Clipboard.
7. Choose Edit > Paste and paste the events to a different track.

Process > Find/Change
The Process > Find/Change command is an extremely flexible way of manipulating the data parameters of events. It works
something like the search-and-replace function in a word processor but with scaling rather than simple replacement.
This command uses two event filters. The first event filter lets you set up your search criteria. The second event filter is used to
define the replacement value ranges. When an event satisfies the search criteria, its parameters are scaled between the search
ranges and the replacement ranges. This permits transposition, inversion, key signature changes, and other operations to be
accomplished with this one simple command.
In the second Event Filter dialog box, the check boxes and value ranges for beats and ticks are ignored. Only the replacement
value ranges for the selected event types are used.
The Process > Find/Change command understands a wild card octave number in the second event filter to mean, “replace the
original note with a different note in the original octave.” Using octave wild cards for both the search and replacement event filters
lets you, for instance, change all E-flats to E-naturals, preserving the octave of each note.
A few examples will illustrate some of the many uses of the Process > Find/Change command. These examples apply to the note
event type, though the command can be used on any type of event.

Controllers, RPNs, NRPNs, and automation data
Cakewalk projects contain a lot more information than the notes and digital audio files that are at the heart of your work. Controllers,
RPNs, and NRPNs (xRPNs, for short) are special types of events used by MIDI software and hardware to control the details of how
MIDI music is played. Automation data are used to adjust volume, pan, and other parameters of MIDI and audio tracks on the fly
while playback is in progress.
Cakewalk lets you enter or edit controller, xRPN, and automation data in several ways:

 Using envelopes in the Track view
 Using the Piano Roll view and Inline Piano Roll view
 Using the Insert > Series of Controllers command
 Editing controller events in the Event List view
Editing data in the Track view’s Clips pane or the Piano Roll view gives you great flexibility. You can examine the controllers in
graphical form and edit them even while recording or playback is in progress. This means you can loop over a portion of your project
and hear any change you make on the next loop.
Note: MIDI envelopes you create in the Piano Roll view and MIDI envelopes you create in the Track view Clips pane are actually
separate envelopes, even if they control the same parameter. Both kinds of envelopes are visible in the Clips pane, and should
generally not be used to control the same parameter. You can convert Piano Roll view envelopes to Track view envelopes by
selecting the time range and tracks that the Piano Roll envelopes occupy, and using the Track view Clips > Convert MIDI
Controllers to Envelopes command. For details, see “Converting MIDI controllers to envelopes” on page 1234.
For more information about automation, see “Automation” on page 1207 and “Mixing” on page 973. For more information about the
Event List view, see “The Event List view” on page 887.
See also:
“Adding and editing controllers in the Piano Roll” on page 843

Controllers
Controllers are the MIDI events such as volume, sustain pedal, and pan that you use to change the sound while you're playing. You
can enter controller data from within Cakewalk, or record them from external devices such as MIDI keyboards.
Controllers let you control the detail and character of your music. Say you’re playing a guitar sound on your synthesizer, but it
sounds lifeless and dull. That’s partly because a guitar player doesn’t just play notes one after another—he often bends or slides on
the strings to put emotion into his playing. You can use controllers in the same way, creating bends, volume swells, and other effects
that make sounds more realistic and more fun to listen to.
Your computer can work the controllers on your electronic instrument by sending MIDI Controller messages. The MIDI specification
allows for 128 different types of controllers, many of which are used for standard purposes. For example, controller 7 is normally
used for volume events, and controller 10 is normally used for pan. Every controller can take on a value ranging from 0 to 127.
The Piano Roll contains several drop-down lists that let you choose the controller you want to see and edit. The contents of these
lists depend on the output and channel settings and on the instrument assigned to that output and channel. Different instruments use
controllers in different ways. See “Instrument definitions” on page 1309.
Note: Cakewalk has automatic searchback for all continuous controller data to ensure that the correct controller values are in
effect regardless of where you start playback. Suppose you start playback halfway through a project. Cakewalk searches back
from that point to find any earlier controller values that should still apply.

Controllers, RPNs, NRPNs, and automation data

885

RPNs and NRPNs
RPNs (Registered Parameter Numbers) and NRPNs (Non-Registered Parameter Numbers) are similar to controllers, except that
both the parameter number and data value can be any number between 0 and 16,383.
When RPNs and NRPNs are transmitted via MIDI or stored in a standard MIDI file, they are converted into four separate controller
messages. Cakewalk detects incoming xRPN messages from MIDI inputs or files and reassembles them into a single RPN or NRPN
event. This provides the convenience of single RPN or NRPN events in Cakewalk plus compatibility with existing files, equipment,
and software. The following table shows the controller numbers Cakewalk uses for RPN and NRPN events.

Automation data
The Track and Console views allow you to record automation data that define changes in volume, pan and many other parameters
throughout a project.
The Track view allows you to create envelopes to adjust several parameters. For more about automation, see “Automation” on page
1207.

Velocity, Pitch Wheel, and Aftertouch
Cakewalk lets you display and edit several other types of data the same way you do controller data. These data include:

 MIDI pitch wheel or pitch-bend messages
 MIDI channel aftertouch (ChanAft) values
 MIDI key aftertouch (KeyAft) values
Remember that note velocity is an attribute of each note and not a completely separate event. You cannot add or remove velocity
events in the Notes pane, but you can use the draw tool to adjust the velocity values for existing notes. You can also edit velocities
with the Process > Scale Velocity command. For more information, see “Adding crescendos and decrescendos” on page 869. You
can edit individual note velocities in the Note Properties dialog box, described in “Changing note properties” on page 1283.

The Event List view shows events in a list format. You can insert, delete, or modify any kind of event, including notes, pitch-wheel
data, velocity, MIDI controllers, patch changes, Wave files, lyrics, text strings, MCI commands, System Exclusive meta-events, and
more.
To open the Event List view, do one of the following:

 Select one or more tracks and choose Views > Event List.
 Right-click a clip in the Clips pane and choose Views > Event List on the pop-up menu.
 Press ALT+8.

The events in the selected tracks are listed one per line, from top to bottom. As you move the highlight through the event list,
Cakewalk updates the Now marker (time display). During playback, the event list scrolls to display the events at the current time.
The current event is centered in the Event List during playback, and the highlight is on the correct event when playback stops. Any
time you change the Now time, the event list is updated and the highlight is moved to the event that will be played next.
When the Event List view includes more than one track, events are mixed together in chronological order. For example, if you select
tracks 1 and 3 when you open the Event List view, you see a single list of intermingled events from tracks 1 and 3. You can have any
number of Event List views, each containing any number of tracks, open at the same time. You can change the tracks shown in the
Event List view by clicking Tracks menu and choosing the tracks you want.

Additional event information
Note Events.

There are three values parameters for note events:

 A pitch, which represents the MIDI key number as a note and an octave.
 A velocity (0–127), which is how fast the key is struck. Some keyboards don’t transmit or receive velocity messages.
 A duration, which is how long the note lasts. This amount is shown in beats:ticks format. (If the note lasts less then one beat, then
only the number of ticks is shown.)
Note names may also represent percussion instruments, and lists of such note names are sometimes associated with a particular
percussion patch. The note C3, for example, may really be “kick drum.” If a patch is associated with a percussion note name list, the
name of the percussion instrument appears in Event List view rather than a note and an octave from the piano keyboard.
Cakewalk uses the following notation to display flats and sharps in this and other views:

MCIcmd events
Media Control Interface (MCI) commands are special events that let you control other multimedia hardware and software (e.g., CDROM drives, laserdiscs, sound cards, animations, video) during playback. MCI commands are part of the multimedia extensions in
Windows. MCIcmd events have one parameter—the command line text of the MCI command. Here are some examples:
This command

Does this

PLAY C:\Train.wav

Plays the Wave file Train.wav

PLAY C:\Videos\Vacation.avi

Plays the video file Vacation.avi from the VIDEOS folder

SET CDAUDIO TIME FORMAT TMSF PLAY CDAUDIO 3

Plays a specific track from the CD drive

STOP CDAUDIO

Stops the CD from playing

While MCI commands can be used to play Wave files, these files are played at their normal speed and are not necessarily
synchronized with MIDI or other audio data. By contrast, Wave audio clips are played in lock-step synchronization with MIDI and
other audio data.
For complete documentation of Windows MCI commands, search for MCI on the Microsoft website (www.microsoft.com).

Articulation maps

Articulation maps are a universal way to deal with expressions/articulations in VST instruments or hardware MIDI instruments that
may be controlled by various methods including:

 Note “key switches”
 The velocity of a note
 Control change events
 Grouping of patches across different MIDI channels (e.g. legato strings patch on ch 1, pizzicato patch on ch 2, etc.)
If you work with sample libraries and virtual instruments, articulation maps are sure to improve your MIDI and articulation/keyswitch
workflow.
Recreating a convincing performance with sample libraries and virtual instruments can be a difficult task. The process is made
somewhat easier if the sampled instrument includes a range of performance articulations, which is commonly controlled via
“keyswitches”. These are used to trigger different sample layers that contain the various performance options. Cakewalk's support
for articulation maps make it easy to work with articulations and keyswitches.
Articulation maps provide a much simpler way of switching articulations, without having to manually edit MIDI events in the track. All
articulations appear neatly at the top of the Piano Roll view instead of spread across the Notes pane, which helps you to better
visualize and edit the articulations and keyswitches.
When recording, you can focus on the actual performance — getting the right notes, rather than building expression into the
performance — then use articulations to add expression after the basic performance has been recorded. Adding articulations as part
of the editing process is often easier than trying to play keyswitches in live via your keyboard.
Articulations do either, or both, of the following:

 Trigger new MIDI events (Generate New MIDI Events in the Articulation Map Editor)
 Alter existing MIDI events (Transform Existing MIDI Events in the Articulation Map Editor)
Articulations that are added to MIDI and Instrument tracks are automatically applied during playback.
An Articulation map is a collection of up to 255 articulations, normally associated with a single VSTi or sample library. Each
articulation has a collection of MIDI Events to send out and/or a collection MIDI Transforms to apply to existing MIDI data.
Cakewalk includes a few general-purpose articulation maps that let you experiment with the feature. You can create your own
articulation maps, or download maps for orchestra libraries and virtual instruments.
Cakewalk can import Cubase expression maps, so you can get started quickly by downloading maps for popular instrument libraries
such as Vienna Symphonic Library, Garritan, Kontakt, etc. See “Importing articulation maps” on page 903.

Articulations in a map are organized into groups. Groups in the selected map are shown in the Articulation Groups section.
Articulations that are mutually exclusive can be grouped together, so they only occupy a single lane in the Articulations pane.
Articulations cannot overlap in the same group/lane.
A single articulation map can contain multiple groups, each containing multiple articulations. Articulations are organized as follows:

 Articulation map
 Group(s)
• Articulation(s)
For example:

 MIDI Transforms
 Pitch
• Up Octave
• Down Octave

 Velocity
• Increase by 20
• Decrease by 20

Editing articulations
You can edit articulations much like Arranger Track sections (drag, resize, merge, etc.). However, articulations cannot be dragged
across lanes/groups.

Reassigning existing articulations
To reassign an articulation to another articulation within the same group, right-click the articulation, point to Reassign, then select
the desired articulation.
To reassign an articulation to another articulation in a different group, double-click the articulation to open the Choose Articulation
dialog, then select the desired articulation.

Editing articulation properties
To edit an articulation’s MIDI messages, name, or color, right-click the articulation and select Edit Articulation Maps. The
Articulation Map Editor opens with the selected articulation already highlighted.

Note: By default, selecting a clip also selects underlying articulations. To disable automatic selection of articulations when
selecting clips, click the Track view Options menu and clear the Select Track Articulations with Clips option.

Specifying an articulation’s MIDI channel
By default, a triggered articulation will use the MIDI channel that is defined in the Articulation Map Editor. To follow the track’s forced
MIDI Channel (if set), or the MIDI channel of the articulation section event as specified in the articulation context menu, set the Chan
value to Follow.

This is an alphabetic list of all available articulation map files (.artmap) that are stored in the master library, which is located in the
C:\Cakewalk Content\Cakewalk Core\Articulation Maps folder.
To insert a map into the current project, double-click the map, or select the map and click the

button.

If you have other .artmap files that you would like to use in Cakewalk, they must be copied to the C:\Cakewalk
Content\Cakewalk Core\Articulation Maps folder. The default Articulation Maps folder can be specified in Edit >
Preferences > File - Folder Location.
Use the search filter to only show folders and articulations that match a specific text string.
To import additional maps into the global map library, click the Import button (see “Importing articulation maps” on page 903).

Articulation Maps in Project section

This section shows all articulation maps that exist in the current project, listed in the order they were added. The maps have either
been imported from the master list, or created from scratch in the project.
If you have modified or created a new articulation map, and you want to use it in other projects, you must first export the map to the
C:\Cakewalk Content\Cakewalk Core\Articulation Maps folder.
To do so, select the map(s) you want to export, then click Export. The exported maps now appear in the global Articulation Maps
list, and can be imported into any project.

Articulation Groups section

Articulations in a map are organized into groups. Articulations that are mutually exclusive are typically grouped together, so they only
occupy a single lane in the Articulations pane. Articulations that are in the same group cannot overlap on the timeline.
Drag to reorder groups, and right-click to delete or duplicate.
To add a group, click the

button.

To delete the selected group, click the

Articulations section

This section lists all articulations in the selected group.
To add a new articulation, click the

button, or click the Add from MIDI button to use MIDI Learn.

To delete the selected articulation, click the

button.

The following settings are available:

 Name. A textual description of the articulation. Double-click to rename.
 Color. The articulation’s color, as shown in the Piano Roll view. Double-click to change the color.
 Duration. The duration in ticks of generated MIDI events when their Play At attribute is set to Start, End, or Both. The default
is 120 ticks.
Drag to reorder articulations, and right-click to delete or duplicate.
To move an articulation into a different group, drag it to a group in the Articulation Groups section.
To specify the articulation’s MIDI message(s), select the articulation and use the Generate New MIDI Events and/or Transform
Existing MIDI Events section to define the MIDI data.

Generate New MIDI Events section

This section lists any MIDI events assigned to the selected articulation. These are events that are generated during playback.
To add a MIDI event, click the

button, or click Add from MIDI to use MIDI Learn.

To delete the selected MIDI event, click the

button.

The following settings are available:

 Kind. The MIDI event’s type:
 Note = MIDI Note
 Key Aft = Key Aftertouch
 CC = Continuous Controller
 CC 14b = 14-bit Continuous Controller / xRPN (MSB + LSB), which offers 16,384 possible values instead of only 128 (only
used for valid 14 bit controller numbers: CC 0–31, 99, and 101)

 Patch = Patch/Program Change
 Ch Aft = Channel Aftertouch
 Wheel = Pitch Wheel
 Chan. The MIDI event’s channel (1-16, Follow). When Follow is selected, the articulation will follow the track’s forced MIDI
Channel (if set), or the MIDI channel of the articulation section event as specified in the articulation context menu.

 Key/CC #. The MIDI event’s note or controller number.
 Vel/CC.V. The MIDI event’s velocity or controller value.
 Transpose. Specify if the articulation should obey or ignore the track’s Key+ (transpose) parameter (see “Adjusting the Key/
transposing a track (Key+)” on page 320). This option should always be disabled for keyswitches. It should only be enabled if the
articulation is generating “musical” note events.

 Play At. Specifies when the articulation should be triggered, and its duration:
 Start = Only play at the articulation event’s start time, for the Duration value specified in the Articulations section
 End = Only play at the articulation event’s end time, for the Duration value specified in the Articulations section
 Both = Play at the articulation event’s start time AND end time, both for the Duration value specified in the Articulations
section

 Duration = Play for the full duration as drawn in the Articulations pane
 Chase Mode. Specifies how the MIDI event should be chased when starting playback mid-way through a project:
 Note = Only the most recent note matching this event’s key will be sent. Only play the note if the note starts before the chase
time, but ends after it.

 CC = Only the most recent CC value matching this event’s CC Number will be sent.
 Full =All instances of this event from the beginning of the track will be sent up until the playback start time.
Transform Existing MIDI Events section

This section lists any MIDI transforms assigned to the selected articulation. MIDI transforms apply real-time adjustment to existing
MIDI data during playback, and you can change any input event to any output event. You can specify min/max ranges in order to
filter which events get transformed.
Transforms are used to modify existing MIDI events within a track, and have many applications, such as:

 Transposing the key of a note
 Changing the MIDI channel of an event
 Clamping or scaling the velocity of a note
 Changing event type (e.g. breath control to aftertouch)
Each transform has an input filter, which specifies whether a MIDI event should be transformed or not. If the MIDI event in question
matches the input filter requirements, then the output transform is applied.
To add a MIDI transform, click the

button.

To delete the selected MIDI transform, click the

button.

The following settings are available:

 #. Shows the MIDI transform’s sequential number.
 Filter. Each transform contains three rows, which provide control over the input filter, output filter, and offset filter.
 The top row shows the input filter, which determines which events the transform should affect.
 The middle row shows how the input events will be transformed during playback.
 The button row lets you apply an offset during playback. You can use the offset controls instead of, or in combination with, the
output filter.
The filter is very flexible. You can convert any input kind (Note, CC, etc.) to any output kind. For example, convert breath
controllers to channel aftertouch.
You also have full control over value ranges by specifying min/max and offset values. By specifying the minimum and maximum
value, you can make sure that only events mapped to a particular range are affected by the articulation.

Creating an articulation map
Creating a custom articulation map from scratch can take some effort, but it’s a one time procedure that can be used in any project.
If you’re using a popular sample library or virtual instrument, chances are that the developer or other users have already created an
articulation map, so search online to see if a map is available for download. Remember, Cakewalk can also import Cubase
expression maps.
If you have to create a map from scratch, first consult the documentation for your virtual instrument or sample library for a list or
supported articulations, so you know how to program the articulation map.
1. Right-click in the Articulations pane and select Edit Articulation Maps to open the Articulation Map Editor.
2. In the Articulation Maps in Project section, click the

button to create a new articulation map.

 Double-click the map name (“New Articulation Map”) and type a descriptive name.
3. In the Articulation Groups section, click the

button to create a new group.

 Double-click the group name (“New Articulation Group”) and type a descriptive name.
 Create a separate group for each set of mutually exclusive articulations. For example, bowed and pizzicato violin articulations
should be in the same group since they cannot be used simultaneously.
4. In the Articulations section, click the

button to create a new articulation.

 Double-click the articulation name (“New Articulation”) and type a descriptive name.
 Double-click the color and duration columns if you want to change the default settings.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 for each additional group and articulation you want to create. Tip: You can right-click to duplicate an existing
group or articulation.
6. Now it’s time to define the key switches and controller switch assignments for each articulation. Decide if you want to define a
MIDI Event or MIDI Transform, or both. You can create complex articulations made of several different MIDI messages. Some
virtual instruments require multiple key switches or combinations of key switches and controllers to select a particular
articulation.

 In the Generate New MIDI Events section, click the

button to create a new MIDI event for the selected articulation.

 In the Transform Existing MIDI Events section, click the

button to create a new MIDI transform for the selected

articulation.
7. Configure the attributes of the generated MIDI events or transformed MIDI events to your liking.
8. If you would like to use the new map in other projects, click the Export button and save the .artmap file in the C:\Cakewalk
Content\Cakewalk Core\Articulation Maps folder. This makes the map available in the global Articulation Map
Library section.
9. Click OK to save the articulation map in the project and close the Articulation Map Editor.

Modifying an existing articulation map

Note: Articulation maps are project based. Any modifications made to an articulation map in the Articulation Map Editor only
apply to the current project. In order to update other projects that use the same map, you must export the modified map to the
articulation maps library, then import the updated map into the other projects.
1. Right-click in the Articulations pane and select Edit Articulation Maps to open the Articulation Map Editor.
2. In the Articulation Map Library section, double-click the articulation map you want to modify. This imports it into the current
project.

 If the map you want to modify already exists in the project, skip step #2 and go directly to step #3.
3. In the Articulation Maps in Project section, select the articulation map you want to modify.
4. Make any desired changes to the Articulation Group, Articulations, Generate New MIDI Events, and Transform Existing
MIDI Events sections.
5. Click the Export button and save the .artmap file in the C:\Cakewalk Content\Cakewalk Core\Articulation Maps
folder. Keep the original name to overwrite the original articulation map, and type a new name to save as a separate map.

Importing articulation maps
If the articulation map you want to use is not listed in the global Articulation Map Library section, you can import a supported map
file from another location. Maps are imported into global map library (C:\Cakewalk Content\Cakewalk Core\Articulation
Maps folder).
You can import the following articulation map file types:

 Cakewalk articulation maps (.artmap)
 Cubase expression maps (.expressionmap)
To import a map, click the Import button in the Articulation Map Editor and select on of the following:

 Import File(s). Import one or more .artmap or .expressionmap files. You can batch import multiple selected files.
 Import Directory. Import all .artmap or .expressionmap files that live in a specific folder. The folder structure of the source
directory will be replicated in the destination directory.
The imported map(s) is added to the Articulation Map Library section.
Articulation maps are not unnecessarily duplicated when importing.
Note: Imported articulation maps will overwrite any existing maps if the names are identical.

Note: When importing an articulation map, be aware that different instruments use different MIDI base octaves. The MIDI note
names you see in the Articulation Map Editor might not match he note names in your instrument(s). For example, Cakewalk
might show C4 while an instrument shows C3. If the there is a mismatch between the displayed octaves, refer to the note
numbers instead of note names, or change the Base Octave for Pitches setting in Edit > Preferences > Customization Display (see “Customization - Display” on page 1710).

Exporting articulation maps
You can export articulation maps that are stored in the current project. This is useful if you want to back up your maps, share maps
with other users, or want to export the map to the global map library so it can be used in other projects.
If you modify an existing map, you must export it to the C:\Cakewalk Content\Cakewalk Core\Articulation Maps folder
in order to use it in other projects.
To export one or more articulation maps, select the map(s) you want to export, then click the Export button.

Applying articulations
Articulations are non-destructive. However, you can apply articulations to the track, and thereby replace the articulation with actual
MIDI events in the track.
You have fine control over which articulations to apply. You can apply selected articulation, all articulations in a group, or all
articulations in a track.
To do so, right-click the articulation lane or any selected articulation, and select one of the following options:

 Apply Selected Articulations
 Apply Group <group name> Articulations to Track
 Apply All Articulations to Track
MIDI events are added to the track, and the articulation(s) is removed from the Articulations pane.

Extracting keyswitch articulations from existing MIDI data
Cakewalk stores articulations separate from regular MIDI data in a track. If you have a MIDI track that has keyswitch articulations
embedded as regular MIDI events, Cakewalk can extract the keyswitch MIDI events from the track and convert them to articulations.
To extract keyswitch articulations from a MIDI track:
1. Make sure the project already contains the target articulation map (see “Using Articulation Maps” on page 893).
2. Right-click in the Articulations pane at the top of the Piano Roll view name area, point to Extract Keyswitch Articulations, then
select the desired articulation map from the submenu. The submenu lists all articulation maps within the current project.

After selecting an articulation map from the submenu, Cakewalk will attempt to match events within the MIDI track to any
articulations. The end result is that the matching MIDI events are extracted from the track and converted to articulations.
The following limitations apply:

 It will only support articulations that use Generated MIDI Events
 It will only extract keyswitches based on Notes, Control Change, or Program Change events
 When matching an articulation that generates multiple events, it will only match events if they are in the same MIDI clip

MIDI effects (MIDI plug-ins)
Cakewalk provides the ability to use plug-in MIDI effects. Using plug-in effects is similar to using the MIDI processing commands offline. The overall procedure is as follows:

 Select the MIDI data to be affected.
 Right-click the selected clip(s) and choose Process Effect > MIDI Effects on the pop-up menu.
 Set effect parameters (or select a preset if you’ve made one for this purpose).
 Click Audition to preview the music with the effect applied.
 Click OK to apply the effect to the selected MIDI data.
If you're not happy with the result, choose Edit > Undo before doing any additional work.
MIDI effects can be applied to whole or partial clips. For example, you can apply an echo to just one note.
MIDI effects can also be applied to MIDI tracks in real time (during playback) in the Track view, Track Inspector and Console views.
Unlike any of the processing described so far, using effects in real time is non-destructive. This means that the MIDI data itself is not
modified.
Note: Offline effects may cause your MIDI events to grow in size. For example, when you apply echo, the clip may need to grow
to accommodate the tail end of the echo.
Cakewalk includes the following MIDI plug-ins:

 Arpeggiator
 Chord Analyzer
 Echo/Delay
 Event Filter
 Quantize
 Transpose
 Velocity

Quantizing
Figure 413. MFX Quantize.

The Quantize command moves events to (or towards) an evenly-spaced timing grid.
The quantize effect parameters are as follows:
Parameter/Option

Meaning

Start Times

Quantize event start times.

Durations

Quantize event durations.

Resolution

The spacing of the grid used for quantization.

Tuplet

Specify the resolution as a tuplet note, for example 5 notes in the time of 4.

Strength (%)

The strength of the adjustments. 100% indicates perfect quantization; otherwise, the command moves the
notes only part way towards the desired position.

Swing (%)

The distortion of timing used to produce a swing feel. A value of 50% indicates a straight rendition; negative and
positive values produce distortion of the timing grid. For more information about swing, see “Swing” on page
871.

Window (%)

The sensitivity of quantization. A value of 100% causes all notes to be quantized. Lower values cause the effect
not to quantize notes that are far from the timing grid.

Offset (Ticks)

The offset of the quantization grid from the start of measure boundaries. A value of 0 indicates perfect
alignment. Values less than 0 shift the grid points earlier; values greater than 0 shift the grid later.

Randomize

Causes a random time offset to be added to or subtracted from each new event time. You must also specify the
maximum offset, as a percentage of the quantization resolution.

To quantize MIDI data
1. Select the data to be affected.
2. Right-click the selected clip(s) and choose Process Effect > MIDI Effects > Cakewalk FX > Quantize on the pop-up menu.
3. Set the quantization parameters, as described in the table above.

Adding Echo/Delay
Figure 414. MFX Echo/Delay.

The Echo Delay command creates a series of repeating echoes of each note. The echo notes can decrease or increase in velocity,
and can be transposed from the original by regular intervals.
The parameters used to specify the echo/delay effect are as follows:
Parameter/Option

Meaning

Decay (%)

The reduction in velocity with each echo. A value greater than 100% indicates an increase in velocity.

No. Echoes

The number of echo notes for each original note. If the velocity reaches 0 before the specified number of
echoes, the effect generates no more echo notes.

Delay

The delay between successive echo notes.

Delay Units

The units used to specify the delay. You may specify delay in ticks, in milliseconds, or as a note duration.

Tap

The delay you specify by tapping the control with the mouse.

Swing (%)

The distortion of timing used to produce a swing feel to the echo. A value of 0% indicates a straight rendition;
negative and positive values produce distortion of the timing grid. For more information about swing, see
“Swing” on page 871.

Pitch (Steps)

The number of steps to transpose each echo note from the previous. You can specify a Diatonic or Chromatic
scale.

Adding Arpeggio
Figure 416. MFX Arpeggiator.

The Arpeggiator command applies an arpeggio to its input and plays it back in real time. You can make it arpeggiate with a swing
feel, or straight and staccato or legato, vary its speed and direction, and specify its range.
The parameters used to specify the arpeggiator effect are as follows:
Parameter/Option

Meaning

Swing (%)

The distortion of timing used to produce a swing feel. A value of 0% indicates a straight rendition; negative
and positive values produce distortion of the timing grid. For more information about swing, see “Swing” on
page 871.

Rate

The delay between successive notes.

Units

The units used to specify the delay. You may specify delay in ticks, in milliseconds, or as a note duration.

Legato (%)

The smoothness of the notes of the arpeggio. 1 percent plays each notes and releases it instantly. 99 percent
plays each note up to the start of the next note.

Path

The direction of the arpeggio. Options are Up, Up (arpeggios go up), Up, Down (arpeggios go up, then down),
Down, Down (arpeggios go down), Down, Up (arpeggios go down, then up).

Play thru

The disposition of the notes you play to specify the arpeggio. Checked plays the original notes. Unchecked
filters out the original notes.

Specify output range

The range over which the arpeggio plays. Checked specifies that the arpeggiator repeats notes at each
octave over the entire specified range. Unchecked specifies that the arpeggiator includes only the notes you
actually play.

Lowest note

The MIDI number of the lowest note of the arpeggio. Numbers run from 0 to 127.

Span (Notes)

The number of half-steps in the range. Numbers run from 12 to 127.

Use chord control

The chord you specify. Checked specifies that the arpeggiator infers the chord from the notes played in the
range. It identifies the chord in the Chord recognized box and uses it to play arpeggios for notes outside the
range.

Lowest note

The MIDI number of the lowest note the arpeggiator uses for chord recognition (0 to 126).

Span (Notes)

The number of half-steps in the range. Numbers run from 1 to 127.

Chord recognized

The chord the Arpeggiator recognizes and plays.

The basics
Drum maps are virtual MIDI ports that you create and edit. Drum maps give you total control over all the MIDI drum sounds you have
access to either in the form of software (soft synths) or hardware (external MIDI sound modules).
Drum maps in Cakewalk allow you to do the following:

 Re-map note events, for example, map a General MIDI drum kit to a non-General MIDI drum kit.
 Create a custom drum kit from several MIDI devices (soft synths, hardware synths) and play it from a single MIDI track if desired.
 Use the Drum Grid Editor to show only the drum sounds you want to see.
 Sort drum sounds to suit your needs.
 Mute and solo individual drum sounds

Digital audio fundamentals
Digital audio is a numeric representation of sound; it is sound stored as numbers. In order to understand what the numbers mean,
you need to start with the basic principles of acoustics, the science of sound.
See:
“Basic acoustics” on page 926
“Example—a guitar string” on page 926
“Waveforms” on page 928
“Recording a sound” on page 930
“The decibel scale” on page 930
“Audio clips” on page 931
“Managing audio data” on page 931

Basic acoustics
Sound is produced when molecules in the air are disturbed by some type of motion produced by a vibrating object. This object,
which might be a guitar string, human vocal cord, or a garbage can, is set into motion because energy is applied to it. The guitar
string is struck by a pick or finger, while the garbage can is hit perhaps by a hammer, but the basic result is the same: they both
begin to vibrate. The rate and amount of vibration is critical to our perception of the sound. If it is not fast enough or strong enough,
we won't hear it. But if the vibration occurs at least twenty times a second and the molecules in the air are moved enough, then we
will hear sound.
See:
“Digital audio fundamentals” on page 926

Example—a guitar string
To understand the process better, let's take a closer look at a guitar string.
When a finger picks a guitar string, the entire string starts to move back and forth at a certain rate. This rate is called the frequency
of the vibration. Because a single back and forth motion is called a cycle, we use a measure of frequency called cycles per
second, or cps. This measure is also known as Hertz, abbreviated Hz. Often the frequency of vibration of an object is very fast, so
we can also express the frequency in thousands of cycles per second, or kilohertz (abbreviated kHz)

The actual distance the string moves is called its displacement. This is proportional to how hard the string is plucked. A greater
displacement results in a louder sound.

926

Editing audio
Digital audio fundamentals

The displacement of the string changes as the string vibrates, as shown here:

The segment marked “A” represents the string as it is pulled back by the pick; “B” shows it moving back towards its resting point, “C”
represents the string moving through the resting point and onward to its outer limit; then “D” has it moving back towards the point of
rest. This pattern repeats continuously until the friction of the molecules in the air gradually slows the string to a stop. As the string
vibrates, it causes the molecules of air around it to vibrate as well. The vibrations are passed along through the air as sound waves.
When the vibrations enter your ear, they make your eardrum vibrate, and you hear a sound. Likewise, if the vibrating air hits a
microphone, it causes the microphone to vibrate and send out electrical signals.
In order for us humans to hear the sound, the frequency of the vibration must be at least 20 Hz. The highest frequency sound we can
hear is theoretically 20 kHz, but, in reality, it's probably closer to 15 or 17 kHz. Other animals, and microphones, have different
hearing ranges.
If the simple back-and-forth motion of the string was the only phenomenon involved in creating a sound, then all stringed instruments
would probably sound much the same. We know this is not true, of course; the laws of physics are not quite so simple. In fact, the
string vibrates not only at its entire length, but at one-half its length, one-third, one-fourth, one-fifth, and so on. These additional
vibrations (overtones) occur at a rate faster than the rate of the original vibration (the fundamental frequency), but are usually
weaker in strength. Our ear doesn't hear each frequency of vibration individually, however. If it if did, we would hear a multinote
chord every time a single string were played. Rather, all these vibrations are added together to form a complex or composite sound
that our ear perceives as a single tone.

This composite waveform still doesn't account for the uniqueness of the sound of different instruments. For example, stringed
instruments usually have a resonator. In the case of the guitar, the resonator is the big block of hollow wood to which the string is
attached (the guitar body). This has a major impact on the sound we perceive when a guitar is played because it enhances or
amplifies some of the vibrations produced by the string and diminishes or attenuates others. The ultimate effect of all the vibrations
occurring simultaneously, being altered by the resonator, adds up to the sound we know as guitar.

Waveforms
A sound wave can be represented in many different ways: as a mathematical formula, as a series of numbers, or graphically as a
waveform. A waveform displays the size, or amplitude, of the vibration as a function of time. For example, the waveform of the
sound of the plucked guitar string might look like this:

The waveform of a trumpet blast might look like this:

And the waveform of a spoken word might look like this:

The three waveforms shown above are quite different from one another, both in appearance and sound. Each has its own
characteristic shape, or envelope, and each has its own complex combination of frequency components, which can change across
the duration of the sound.

Digital audio fundamentals

The center line of a waveform is the zero line; it corresponds to the rest position (displacement of 0) of the original vibrating object.
(A waveform for perfect silence would be a horizontal line at zero.) Back and forth motions of the vibrating object translate to upward
(positive) and downward (negative) excursions of waveform amplitude. For example, a close-up of a portion of the guitar waveform
might look like this:

The waveform crosses the zero line twice during each complete vibration. These zero-crossings are important in digital audio
processing; they are good places to cut waveforms apart and splice them together. If waveforms are cut or spliced at other locations,
clicks and pops can occur. The maximum amplitude of the waveform in each vibration is also important: it determines the strength of
the vibration, and thus the loudness of the sound.

Recording a sound
To record digital audio, your computer monitors the electrical signal generated by a microphone (or some other electroacoustical
device). Because the signal is caused by a sound, the signal strength varies in direct proportion to the sound’s waveform. The
computer measures and saves the strength of the electrical signal from the microphone, thus recording the waveform.
There are two important aspects of this measuring process. First is the sampling rate, the rate at which the computer saves
measurements of the signal strength. It is a known fact of physics that you must measure, or sample, the signal at a rate at least
twice that of the highest frequency you want to capture. For example, suppose you want to record a moderately high note on a
violin—say the A whose fundamental frequency is 440 Hz and all overtones up to five times the fundamental. The highest frequency
you want to capture is 2,200 Hz, so you need to measure the electrical signal from the microphone at least 4,400 times per second.
Since humans can hear frequencies well above 10 kHz, most sound cards and digital recording systems are capable of sampling at
much higher rates than that. Typical sampling rates used by modern musicians and audio engineers are 22 kHz, 44.1 kHz, and 48
kHz. The 44.1 kHz rate is called CD-quality, since it is the rate used by audio compact discs.
The other important aspect of the measuring process is the sampling resolution. The sampling resolution determines how
accurately the amplitude of each sample is measured. At present, the music industry has settled on a system that provides 65,536
different values to assign to the amplitude of a waveform at any given instant. Thus, each sample saved by your computer requires
2 bytes (16 bits) to store, since it takes 2 bytes to store a number from –32,768 to 32,767. The scaling of the electrical input signal
level to amplitude value is determined by your audio hardware and by the position of your input level control.
What if the amplitude of the sampled signal gets too high, such that a 16-bit number is not large enough to represent it? What
typically happens is that the signal is clipped, cut off at the maximum value.
Here is what a clipped waveform might look like:

Clipping is not usually desirable and may have unpleasant audible effects. Sudden irregularities in the waveform of any type can
cause clicks, pops, and distortion of the original sound.
See:
“Digital audio fundamentals” on page 926
“Recording audio” on page 362

The decibel scale
In acoustics, the decibel (dB) scale is a scale for measuring the relative loudness of two sounds. For example, environmental noise
is often measured as follows:
L = 20 log (p/p0)
where L is the sound pressure level (in dB), p is the sound pressure amplitude, and p0 is a reference amplitude of 20 micropascals
(less than one billionth of atmospheric pressure). On this scale, a barely audible sound (p = p0) has a sound pressure level of 0 dB,
normal conversation (p = 1,000*p0) is at a level of around 60 dB, and a jet engine at close range (p = 1,000,000*p0) is at a
level of around 120 dB.
Similar decibel scales are used in other branches of science and engineering to measure electrical power levels and other signal
levels, always with respect to some reference level.
In Cakewalk, decibels are used in several places:

 To indicate volume levels of audio tracks in the Track view, Track Inspector and Console view
 To indicate the effects of filters and equalizers
The reference level (0 dB) usually corresponds to the current loudness of the sound. A positive change in decibels makes the sound
louder; a negative change makes the sound quieter.

Audio clips
If you have read “Digital audio fundamentals” on page 926, you should have a good idea of what is contained in a Cakewalk audio
clip. An audio clip contains a long series of numbers, or samples, representing the fluctuating amplitude of a waveform. Audio clips
are typically quite large, hundreds of kilobytes to many megabytes in size. By comparison, a MIDI event takes only a few bytes to
store.
The Track view lets you see your audio waveforms in great detail; you can zoom in until you see the individual samples.
You should also now be aware of some things to watch out for when editing your audio data. First, if you cut audio clips apart or
splice them together, you should do so at zero-crossings in the waveform (places where the amplitude is zero), in order to avoid
sudden changes in amplitude that may cause clicks and pops. Second, you should beware of clipping. Clipping of the audio
waveform can occur if you record a signal at too high a record level, or if you apply audio processing or effects that increase the
waveform amplitude too much. If you accidentally cause the waveform to clip, you should undo the command and try again with
different parameters.
Clipping can also occur in other situations, for example, if you try to play or mix several loud audio tracks together, the aggregate
signal strength may at times exceed the clipping limit, and the output signal will be distorted. To correct the problem, you can create
a volume envelope to reduce the level in loud audio clips or reduce the track volume in the Console or Track views.
See:
“Digital audio fundamentals” on page 926

Managing audio data
Because of the great size of audio data, Cakewalk uses an intelligent scheme for storing audio clips on disk to conserve disk space
and minimize the time it takes to load and save data. Audio data is not stored directly in your project file, but rather in separate files
in a special directory. For more information, see “Audio file management” on page 1347.
You can export your project in MP3, WMA, or Wave format. You can also convert your project’s MIDI data to audio and export it to
any of the above formats. For more information, see “Exporting audio” on page 1135.

The Track view lets you perform basic editing tasks such as cut, copy, paste, delete, drag-and-drop, split, and bounce. You can drag
fade-ins and fade-outs onto a clip using your mouse or you can set complex envelopes on both clips and tracks. You can use
envelopes to change settings for gain (volume), pan, mute, bus send level and bus send pan. The Scrub tool lets you audition
portions of audio by dragging the mouse.
Use the Select tool to make selections.

Editing clip properties
Audio clips have several properties that you can change:
Property

Description

Name

The name of a clip is used in the Track view and Event List view. You can assign any name to help you remember the
contents of the clip.

Start

The start determines when the sample is played.

Length

The length indicates the size of the clip.

Snap Offset

A value that represents the number of samples into the clip at which the clip snaps to.

Display Color

The clip’s color in the Track view.

To change an audio clip’s name
1. Select the audio clip.
2. In the Clip Properties Inspector, type a new name in the Clip Name box.
The new clip name appears in the upper left corner of the clip.

To change a clip’s start
1. Select the audio clip.
2. In the Clip Properties Inspector, enter a new starting time in the Start field.
The Track view displays the clip at the new starting time.

Moving, copying, pasting and deleting audio clips
Clips can be cut, copied, pasted, and deleted with Edit menu commands, or moved and copied with drag-and-drop techniques. For
more information, see “Arranging and editing” on page 437.

Audio scaling
Audio scaling is the increase or decrease in the size (scale) of the waveform in a track or bus. Audio scaling allows you to make
detailed edits by zooming in on the parts of the waveform closest to the zero crossing (silence) while preserving the track or bus size.
By showing just the quietest parts of a clip, you can make very precise edits. You can also zoom out on the waveform.
You can change the audio scale using keyboard shortcuts or the Audio Scale Ruler.
The Audio Scale Ruler is located in the vertical splitter bar between the Clips pane and the Track pane.

There are three display options in the Audio Scale Ruler:

 Percentage. Shows audio scaling by percentage. For example, if the highest percentage in the Audio Scale Ruler reads 2.0%,
then only the parts of the waveform which are within 2% of the zero crossing appear in the clip.

 dB. Shows audio scaling by dB. For example, if the highest dB in the Audio Scaling Ruler reads -36, then only the parts of the
waveform which are 36 dB below 0 dB appear in the clip.

 Zoom Factor. Shows audio scaling by a factor. For example, if the Zoom Factor reads 10, then the waveform is zoomed in by a
factor of 10.
Note: The Audio Scale Ruler display reflects the type of audio clip directly beneath it. If it is a stereo waveform, the Audio Scale
Ruler appears in stereo (one for each channel). If it is a mono clip it appears in mono. Also, the Audio Scale Ruler only displays
numbers when it is above a certain height. If you cannot see the Audio Scale Ruler, increase the size of your track or bus.

To change the Audio Scale Display option
1. Right-click on the Audio Scale Ruler in any track.
A menu appears. The current display option is checked.
2. Select an option from the menu.

Split When Silent For At Least

Creates a split after each period of silence which exceeds the number of measures specified.

Cakewalk splits the audio clip according to your specifications. Each new clip has the same name as the original clip.
Note: A shortcut to split a selected clip is to move the Now time to where you want to split it, and press S on your computer
keyboard.

Bouncing to clips
Individual audio clips in the same track can be combined into a single clip with the Bounce to Clip(s) command.
Note 1: Like any clips, slip-edited clips can be combined with other clips using the Bounce to Clip(s) command. When a slipedited clip is combined with another clip, any slip-edited data (audio clips or MIDI events that are cropped from view) is
overwritten.

Note 2: You control the bit depth of all rendering operations (bouncing, freezing, applying effects) in Edit > Preferences > File
- Audio Data, in the Render Bit Depth field. The default value of 32 is the best for most situations. See “Bit depths for rendering
audio” on page 1361 for more information.

To bounce to clips
1. Select the clips to be combined in the Track view.
2. Click the Track view Clips menu and choose Bounce to Clip(s).
The clips are combined into a single clip. Empty space between clips is filled with silence in the new clip. All clip automation from the
source clips is applied to the new clip.

Bouncing AudioSnap and stretched clips
Cakewalk includes a command to select all AudioSnap and stretched clips. The primary use of this command is to quickly select all
stretched audio clips before you use the Track view Clips > Bounce to Clip(s) command.
There are two common reasons why you may want to bounce AudioSnap and stretched clips:

 To free up CPU resources during playback.
 In order to save a bundle (.cwb) file, which does not support AudioSnap data.

Basic audio processing
Audio processing commands let you modify audio data according to some rule or algorithm. The rule can be as simple as reversing
the audio data or boosting it by a certain factor, or as complex as performing a Fourier analysis and selectively amplifying or
attenuating sounds at certain frequencies.
Audio processing commands can work on whole, partial and non-contiguous clips. For example, suppose you want to make certain
words in a vocal passage softer. You can create a volume envelope and use it to lower the volume, non-destructively in just the
section of the track containing those words. You could also use the Process > Apply Effect > Gain command to lower the volume
destructively.
You should listen to the results of your work after each audio processing command. If you don’t like what you hear, you can use
Edit > Undo to restore your audio data to its previous state.
Many of the dialog boxes associated with Cakewalk’s audio processing and effects commands have two important features: Audition
and Presets.
The Audition button is used to audition the processed audio data. When you click Audition, Cakewalk processes the first few
seconds of your data, then plays it repeatedly until you click Stop. This helps you to get an idea of whether the settings in the dialog
box are producing the desired effect.
Presets are a way to store dialog box settings so that you can apply the exact same processing or effect again in the future. The
following table tells you how to use presets in the effects dialog boxes.
To do this
Save the current settings as a preset
Use a preset
Delete a preset

Do this
Enter a preset name and click the Save button
Select the preset from the drop-down list
Select the preset, then click the Delete button

Many audio processing and effects presets are supplied with Cakewalk.
See:
“Using the Normalize and Gain commands” on page 938
“Reversing audio data” on page 939

Using the Normalize and Gain commands
Cakewalk provides several commands to boost or cut the volume of audio data. The Process > Apply Effect > Normalize
command, and the Process > Apply Effect > Gain commands are used to control the volume of selected audio data, in decibels.
For more information about the decibel scale, see “The decibel scale” on page 930. The Normalize command “normalizes” the
audio data: it boosts the volume until the maximum amplitude is reached somewhere in the data. By normalizing the data, you
achieve the maximum possible volume without distortion or clipping. The Gain command lets you edit the volume, phase, and stereo
interleave of selected audio data. You can also use this command to remove center material from a clip (good for removing vocals).
Like all the audio processing commands, these commands work by modifying the waveform data. You can achieve volume changes
non-destructively using automation. For more information, see “Automation” on page 1207.
When increasing or decreasing the volume of audio clips, you should consider the following points:

 Normalize raises the noise floor; that is, while it increases the volume of the signal, it also boosts the noise it contains. (This is
true when you raise the volume by other means, too.)

 Due to the nature and limitations of digital audio, the sum of all audio signals played together cannot exceed the waveform
amplitude limit. Even though no individual clip is clipped, the combination may cause distortion.
If the selection contains any loud signals, Normalize may not seem to have any effect. This is because the volume increase is
determined by the loudest audio in the selection. If an audio clip contains segments that are too quiet and others that are loud, you
should probably split off the quiet segments into separate clips and then normalize those.

Normalize dialog box.

To use the Gain command
1. Select the audio data you want to edit.
2. Choose Process > Apply Effect > Gain to open the Gain dialog box.
3. If you only want to change the overall volume of the selection, move the New Left Channel-From Left slider and the New Right
Channel-From Right sliders by a similar amount. You can press the Audition button to try out your edits.
4. If you want to switch the two channels, reverse all four sliders from their present positions.
5. If you want to invert the left channel phase, click the Invert left-channel phase button
. If you want to invert the right-channel
phase, click the Invert right-channel phase button in the New Right Channel section.
6. If you want to remove center material (usually where the vocal track is), set the New Left Channel-From Left slider and the New
Right Channel-From Right slider to 100%, and set the New Left Channel-From Right slider and the New Right ChannelFrom Left slider to -INF.
7. Press the Audition button if you want to audition your edits.
8. Click OK to process the selected audio.
Listen to the edited data in your mix. You can use the Edit > Undo command if you don’t like the results, and then try different
settings in the Gain dialog box.

Reversing audio data
By reversing audio data, you can make it play backwards. You may want to do this to obtain unusual sounds for special effects.
The Reverse command does not reverse the musical position of audio data. Use the Process > Retrograde command to invert the
order of clips in time.

Advanced audio processing
Cakewalk provides a number of advanced audio processing commands for power users. Among these are commands to apply
fades and crossfades.
See:
“Removing silence” on page 940
“Applying fades and crossfades offline” on page 942
“Removing DC offset” on page 941

Removing silence
The Remove Silence command detects sections of audio that fall below a given loudness threshold, and replaces those sections
with absolute silence. Remove Silence gives you the option of actually deleting the silent sections from the selected audio clips,
splitting long audio clips into a greater number of shorter audio clips.
Cakewalk treats passages of absolute silence intelligently. It doesn’t store stretches of silence on disk, and thereby conserves disk
space. During a passage of absolute silence, Cakewalk sends no signal to the digital output port; this results in cleaner audio
playback. Remove Silence is great for cleaning up your final audio mix, because it can mute all audio tracks in which the live
performers were “laying out.”
Using Remove Silence to split long audio clips into smaller ones opens a variety of creative possibilities.
The parameters in the Remove Silence dialog box are used to specify exactly what you mean by silence. More precisely, Remove
Silence employs what is called a digital noise gate. The gate is a type of filter, it passes data through, or stops it from passing
through, according to certain criteria. Parameters in the dialog box specify the conditions under which the gate is opened and under
which it closes again.
The digital noise gate parameters are described in the following table.
Parameter

Meaning

Open Level (dB)

The loudness threshold for opening the noise gate. The gate officially opens when loudness rises above this level,
although it can open earlier because of the Attack Time.

Close Level (dB)

The loudness threshold for closing the noise gate. The gate officially closes when loudness falls below this level,
although it can stay open later because of the Release Time.

Attack Time (ms)

The value in this field is the interval of time after the volume reaches the Open Level for the gate to fully open.
Opening the gate gradually produces a fade-in effect instead of an instant on-off sound.

Hold Time (ms)

The minimum time for the gate to stay open. Hold Time is useful when you’ve set high open and close levels, for
example, when your source signal is very loud. Noise gates set this way tend to react to repeated percussive
passages (such as drum rolls) by repeatedly opening and closing; this can sound unpleasant. By setting a hold time,
you can ensure that the gate stays open long enough during percussive passages.

Release Time (ms)

The amount of time after the Close Level is reached that the gate actually closes. This lets the tail end of sounds
pass through without being clipped.

Look Ahead (ms)

The value in this field causes the gate to open slightly before the sound reaches the Open Level so you don’t lose the
sound’s attack.

Removing DC offset
Some models of audio hardware produce a DC offset while recording, which is caused by electrical mismatches between the audio
hardware and the input device or instrument. Although imperceptible, DC offset may cause problems in further stages of sound
processing.
Note: An easy way to spot DC offset is to zoom in to a silent section of your sound file. If the silent waveform matches the
centerline in the waveform display, your file does not contain DC offset.

To remove DC offset from existing audio
1. Select the audio data and choose Process > Apply Effect > Remove DC Offset. This launches the Remove DC Offset dialog
box.
2. Choose from the following options, and click OK:

 DC Offset Threshold (dB). You can set a minimum dB threshold. If the analyzed DC offset is below this value, no removal
takes place.

 Analyze Left Channel (dB) and Right Channel (dB). This field displays the DC offset separately for the left and right
channels. Press the Audition button to update the display.

 Compute DC Offset from first 5 seconds only. To speed processing, select the Compute DC offset from first 5 seconds
only check box. Only the first five seconds of a sound file will be analyzed when measuring the DC offset. The only time that
five seconds is not sufficient is if a long fade-in or mute has been applied at the beginning of the file.

To remove DC offset during recording
1. Go to Process > Apply Effect > Remove DC Offset to open the Remove DC Offset dialog box.
2. In the DC Offset Threshold (dB) field, set a minimum dB threshold, and click OK to close the dialog box. If the analyzed DC
offset is below this value, no removal takes place.

Applying fades and crossfades offline
Cakewalk provides several commands for applying gradual volume changes to audio data. The first command, Fade/Envelope, lets
you fade-in or fade-out, and lets you choose an envelope, a curve that governs the rate of the fade. The starting envelope can be
linear (straight line), exponential, or inverse exponential. You can change the shape of the envelope before applying the fade.
The envelope in the Fade/Envelope dialog box is made of one or more connected line segments (the linear curves are a single
segment, the exponential curves consist of nine segments each). Although the endpoints of the curve are fixed, you can move the
intermediate points, and create new intermediate points, to change the shape of the curve.
To do this

Do this

Move a point

Click and drag it to a new location

Insert a new point

Click on the line between existing points

Remove a point

Drag it onto the next point

Restart from the original curve

Click Reset

The second command, Crossfade, lets you create a smooth transition from one audio clip to another, by fading two overlapping
audio clips simultaneously (one fades out, the other fades in). As with Fade/Envelope, you can choose from three different starting
curves and change the shape of the curve.

To apply a fade to audio data
1. Select the audio data to be affected.
2. Choose Process > Apply Effect > Fade/Envelope to open the Fade/Envelope dialog box.
3. Select an envelope from the drop-down list.
Figure 424. The Fade/Envelope dialog box.

4. If desired, manipulate the curve as described in the table above.
5. Click OK.
Cakewalk applies the fade to the selected audio data.

To crossfade two overlapping clips
1. Select two overlapping audio clips. They need not be on the same track, but they must overlap in time for the command to have
any effect.
2. Choose Process > Apply Effect > Crossfade to open the Crossfade dialog box.
3. Select an envelope from the drop-down list.
Figure 425. The Crossfade dialog box.

4. If desired, manipulate the curve as described in the table above. You can manipulate only the curve pertaining to the first of the
two overlapping clips; the second curve is automatically adjusted so that the two curves constantly add up to 100%.
5. Click OK.
Cakewalk applies the two fades to the selected data.

Audio effects (audio plug-ins)
Cakewalk provides the ability to use plug-in audio effects. Some audio plug-in effects are supplied with Cakewalk. Others can be
purchased from third-party software manufacturers, and appear automatically in Cakewalk’s menus once they are installed on your
system. If you need help when using a plug-in, press the F1 key on your computer keyboard to open the plug-in’s help file. Please
note that third-party plug-ins may not have a help file.
For a list of all included plug-ins, see “Included plug-ins” on page 1477.
Using plug-in effects is similar to using the audio processing commands off-line. The overall procedure is as follows:

 In the Track view, Track Inspector or Console view, right-click the FX Rack and select an effect from the pop-up menu.
 Set effect parameters (or select a preset).
 Listen to the track and adjust parameters based on what you hear.
You can add audio effects, like MIDI effects, to audio tracks in real time (during playback) in the Console and Track views. Unlike
some of the audio processing discussed so far, using effects in real time is non-destructive. This means that the audio clip data itself
is not modified, and no new audio files are created. For more information about real-time effects, see “Mixing” on page 973.
Note: Off-line effects may cause your audio clips to grow in length. For example, when you apply reverb, your clip may need
to lengthen to accommodate the sound of the reverberation. The additional sound that an effect produces from a clip is called
an effects tail.

See:
“Real-time audio effects processing” on page 944
“Destructive audio effects processing” on page 944

Real-time audio effects processing
From the Console and Track views you can destructively apply audio effects for one or more tracks. When you are pleased with the
audio effects you have patched into a track, you can apply the effects to the track. Destructively applying effects to a track saves
resources, allowing you to include additional tracks and/or effects.

To apply audio effects
Add one or more audio effects to one or more tracks in either the Track view or the Console view, and then:
1. In the Track view, select the tracks you want to be affected.
2. Select Process > Apply Effect > Audio Effects from the menu.
3. If desired, select the option to delete the effects after applying them.
4. Click OK.
If you do not delete the effects from each track after applying them, they remain active.
Note: Applying effects can be undone, but the effects are not then re-patched in the FX Rack.

Note: The core Cakewalk installer does not include all available software instruments. Please download and install the optional
instruments via BandLab Assistant (see “BandLab Assistant” on page 276).
Cakewalk’s Synth Rack makes inserting a soft synth or ReWire instrument a one-step process, and makes viewing and configuring
these instruments simple. In the Synth Rack you can insert and delete synths, create control knobs to control and/or automate
parameters, scroll through patches and presets, mute, solo, freeze, and choose what track to display automation data on. You can
easily control all of your soft synths from one view.
Cakewalk also supports multi-port synths, which allow you to use different synth tracks and effects for each patch or group of
patches in a multi-timbral, multi-port synth.
Cakewalk seamlessly integrates VST synths. The VST Configuration Wizard runs automatically on startup, registering all your VST
plug-ins. See “VST configuration” on page 1036 for more information.

Synth Rack
To open the Synth Rack, click the Views menu and select Synth Rack View (or press ALT+9). The Synth Rack lets you view, insert,
delete, and configure your soft synths. You can also mute, solo, and freeze any or all of them from this view. Each time you insert a
soft synth into your project, a new row appears in the Synth Rack with the name of the soft synth and its current preset. You can
select different presets from the view. You can insert as many copies of the same soft synth as you like; each new copy appears in a
new row and has the same name, but has a higher number after the name (ReWire soft synths can only have one copy open). The
new higher-numbered name also appears on the menus of synth track inputs and MIDI track outputs.

Synth tracks
Using a soft synth introduces a third kind of track to your project alongside audio and MIDI tracks. A synth track functions much like
an audio track, but with a few differences:

 A synth track’s input is always a synth or a ReWire device, which means you cannot record audio or enable input monitoring from
another source on that track.

 A synth track can display a waveform preview of its output. When you enable this display function by clicking the

button on the

track strip, the amplitude of a synth track's audio signal is graphed in real time as a waveform.

 Synth tracks are distinguished by the synth icon to the right of the track number.

Inserting soft synths
In order to play a soft synth from a MIDI controller or with recorded MIDI data, you need to have at least one synth track that lists the
soft synth in its Input field, and at least one MIDI track that lists the soft synth in its Output field. The data from the MIDI track feeds
the synth track and plays the soft synth. If you’re playing the soft synth with a MIDI controller, the MIDI track that’s feeding the synth
track must have the focus (lighter color). You can also patch the soft synth into an audio track’s FX Rack instead of a synth track’s
Input field.
To add a soft synth to the audio and synth tracks’ Input menus (drop-downs) and the MIDI tracks’ Output menus, you have to insert
each soft synth that you want to use into each project. There are two basic ways to insert soft synths in Cakewalk:
1. You can insert soft synths from the Synth Rack view or with the Insert > Soft Synth command. If you use this method, you can
choose to have Cakewalk create the necessary synth and MIDI tracks, and patch them together correctly. If you want to use
multiple synth tracks to take advantage of Cakewalk’s support for the multi-output soft synth format, you need to create and
patch additional MIDI tracks manually to feed the additional synth tracks.
2. You can insert soft synths into FX Racks of individual audio tracks. If you use this method, you need to set a MIDI track’s Output
field to the name of the soft synth you inserted. Then you can record MIDI data in the MIDI track to play the soft synth with.
The procedure for inserting multi-output and single-output soft synths is basically the same. There are just more tracks possibly
involved when you insert a multi-output soft synth.
You can insert more than one copy (also called an instance) of the same soft synth. Each new copy has the same name as the
previous copy except for having a higher number after the name. Every copy appears in a separate row in the drop-down menus of
synth and audio track inputs and MIDI track outputs.

To insert a soft synth from the Add Track menu
1. Click the Add Track button

in the Track view to open the Add Track menu.

2. Click the Instrument tab.
3. Select the desired settings.

 Instrument. Select the desired soft synth. The options are as follows:
• Default.

Select the default Cakewalk TTS-1 soft synth.

• VST3/VST2/DirectX. Select any available VST3, VST2, or DirectX soft synth.
• MIDI Only. Create regular MIDI tracks.

 Input. Select the desired MIDI input device. The options include the on-screen Virtual Controller/Keyboard and all available
MIDI input drivers.

 Record Enable. Activate the Arm for Recording button

on each new track (requires an input to also be selected).

 Open Virtual Controller. Opens the on-screen Virtual Controller/Keyboard after tracks have been created. For details, see
“Virtual Controller/Keyboard” on page 1881.

 Advanced. Show/hide the following advanced settings:
• Create Folder.

Place the new track(s) inside a new track folder. For details, see “Track folders” on page 549.

• Split Instrument Track. Split the instrument track into separate audio and MIDI tracks. For details, see “Splitting an
instrument track to separate audio and MIDI tracks” on page 954. Specify which instrument output(s) to use for the split
audio track(s). The options are as follows:
Main Outputs. A new audio track appears that uses the instrument’s first audio output as an audio input.
All Stereo. One new stereo audio track appears for each stereo audio output that the instrument exposes. Each new track
uses a different instrument output as an audio input.
All Mono. Two new mono audio tracks (one Left and one Right) appear for each stereo audio output that the instrument
exposes. Each pair of new audio tracks uses a different instrument output as an audio input.
• Output. Specify the output. For Instrument tracks, select an audio port. For MIDI tracks, select an existing instrument or
MIDI port.
4. In the Track(s) box, specify how many tracks you want to create.
5. Click Create.

4. Choose options from the Insert Soft Synth Options dialog box according to the following:

 If you want to create a MIDI track that uses the soft synth as an output, select the Create These Tracks: MIDI Source check
box.

 If you want to create a single synth track that acts as an output for Output 1 of the soft synth, select the Create These Tracks:
First Synth Audio Output check box.

 If you want to create separate synth tracks for each of the soft synth’s outputs, select the Create These Tracks: All Synth
Audio Outputs check box.

 If you want to use existing MIDI and audio tracks to play the soft synth, uncheck all of the Create These Tracks options.
Cakewalk adds the soft synth to the audio track input and MIDI track Output menus. You need to set an existing MIDI track’s
Output field to the soft synth, and set an existing audio track’s Input field to the soft synth (the audio track will then become a
synth track).

 If you want to open the soft synth’s interface from this dialog box, select the Open These Windows: Synth Property Page
check box.

 If you opened this dialog box from the Insert menu and want to open the Synth Rack view, select the Open These Windows:

 If the synth you’re inserting can create or send MIDI data, and you want to record or redirect this MIDI data, enable the Enable
MIDI Output check box.

 Any automation data you create for this synth is displayed by default on the Synth track for this synth. If you want to display
this data on a different track, choose the track in the Display Automation On menu.

 If you create some new knobs on the Synth Rack to control certain parameters on a particular synth, you can display the same
knobs every time you insert that synth by enabling the Recall Assignable Controls check box.

 If you want to open this dialog box every time you use the Insert > Soft Synths command, or click the Insert button in the
Synth Rack view and choose a synth from the pop-up menu, select the Ask This Every Time option. If you always insert soft
synths in the same way, you can uncheck this option so you don’t have to deal with the dialog box each time. To open the
dialog box when the option is unchecked, click the Insert Soft Synth Options button

in the Synth Rack.

5. Click OK to close the dialog box and insert the synth.
Cakewalk adds the soft synth to the audio track Input and MIDI track Output menus, and creates any new tracks that you
requested. The new tracks already have the correct inputs and outputs patched. Now you can record MIDI data in the soft synth
MIDI tracks, and/or play the soft synth from a MIDI keyboard or controller. See “Playing a soft synth” on page 955.

To insert a soft synth in an FX Rack
1. In either the Track view, Track Inspector or Console view, right-click the FX Rack of an unused audio track or bus.
Note: If you patch a soft synth into a bus that has no audio track assigned to it, the soft synth does not sound. Always use a
bus that has at least one audio track sending data to it.
The plug-in menu appears.
2. Under Soft Synths, choose the name of a soft synth.
Two things happen: the soft synth’s interface appears, and the soft synth’s name appears in the track’s or bus’s FX Rack, with a
Bypass button next to the name.
3. Set the soft synth’s parameters (choose sounds, effects, etc.), and drag its interface out of the way.
4. Click the Output field of a MIDI track to display the Output menu.
5. Select the name of the soft synth that you patched into the audio track or bus.
6. If the soft synth is multi-timbral, choose a MIDI channel for the MIDI track.
7. Also in the MIDI track, select a bank and patch.
Now you can record some MIDI data into the MIDI track to play the soft synth with. See “To play a soft synth with recorded MIDI data”
on page 955.

Using instrument tracks
Cakewalk has a track type called instrument track, which makes it very simple to work with soft synths. An instrument track is
essentially two tracks—a MIDI track and an audio track, both associated with the same soft synth—contained in a single track strip.
An instrument track allows you to control the MIDI data that is sent to a soft synth and the audio signal that is returned from the soft
synth.

To create an instrument track
In order to create an instrument track, you must first insert a new soft synth.
1. Do one of the following to insert a new soft synth:

 On the Insert menu, point to Soft Synth and select the desired soft synth.
 In the Synth Rack, click the Insert Soft Synth and ReWire devices button

and select the desired soft synth from the pop-

up menu.
The Insert Soft Synth Options dialog box appears.

Instrument track controls
Because an instrument track is a hybrid between an audio and a MIDI track, an instrument track strip contains both audio and MIDI
controls.
The instrument track strip exposes MIDI input and audio output controls. Internally, the MIDI output is assigned to the soft synth’s
MIDI input, and the audio input is assigned to the soft synth’s main output.

Playing a soft synth
There are several ways to play a soft synth:

 You can record MIDI data and use the soft synth as a playback device.
Note: WDM or ASIO drivers do not improve performance when you play back recorded MIDI data—the improvement comes
only when you play a soft synth in real time from an external MIDI controller or keyboard.

 You can play the soft synth in real time from a MIDI controller or keyboard. To avoid excessive latency, your sound card must be
using a WDM or ASIO driver. Also, you must set mixing latency to the lowest achievable level (probably less than 10 msec.),
which you do by adjusting the Buffer Size slider in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings.

 Some soft synths that use the DXi 2 format can send MIDI data, sometimes including MIDI notes, from their interfaces to
Cakewalk. For example, some soft synths have MIDI keyboards built into their interfaces that you can click to send note on/off
messages.
See “Recording a soft synth’s MIDI output” on page 961 for more information.

To play a soft synth with recorded MIDI data
1. Insert a soft synth into the project.
2. In the MIDI track that sends its output to the soft synth, choose a MIDI channel.
3. Open the soft synth’s interface (see “Opening a soft synth’s property page” on page 954).
4. Set the soft synth’s parameters (choose sounds, effects, etc.), and drag its interface out of the way (the soft synth’s interface
does not have to be open for the soft synth to sound).
5. If you want to save your soft synth settings, type a name in the Presets field, and click the Disk icon that’s next to the Presets
field.
6. Record some MIDI data into the MIDI track.
When you play back the recorded MIDI data, you should hear the soft synth through your sound card’s outputs. If you don’t, make
sure your data is in the right range; a bank, patch, and channel are selected; your monitor speakers or headphones are turned up;
and that none of the relevant tracks are muted.
You can add effects to each of the synth tracks. You can also add MIDI effects to your soft synth MIDI tracks.

To play a soft synth from a MIDI controller
1. Make sure your controller is set to local off.
2. Make sure that the Audio Engine button

in the Control Bar’s Transport module is enabled.

3. Insert a soft synth into your project (see “Inserting soft synths” on page 948, if necessary).
Note: If you patch a soft synth into a bus that has no audio track assigned to it, the soft synth does not sound. Always use a
bus that has at least one audio track sending data to it.
4. In the MIDI track that sends its output to the soft synth, choose a MIDI channel.
5. Open the soft synth’s interface (see “Opening a soft synth’s property page” on page 954).
Note: You can also open a soft synth’s interface by double-clicking its name where it appears in a MIDI track’s Output menu
or a synth track’s Input menu.
6. Set the soft synth’s parameters (choose sounds, effects, etc.), and drag its interface out of the way.
7. If you want to save your soft synth settings, type a name in the Presets field, and click the Disk icon that’s next to the Presets
field.
8. Make sure that the MIDI track has the focus (its titlebar is lighter), and play your MIDI controller.
When you play your MIDI controller you should hear the soft synth through your sound card’s outputs. If you don’t, make sure you’re
playing in the right range; a bank, patch, and channel are selected; your monitor speakers or headphones are turned up; your
controller is attached to your MIDI interface; and that none of the relevant tracks are muted.

 If your soft synth is patched into the FX Rack of an audio track or bus, right-click the name of the soft synth, and choose Delete
from the pop-up menu.

 If your soft synth is patched into the Input field of a synth track, go to the Synth Rack, click the name of the soft synth to select it,
and then click the Delete button. Cakewalk deletes the soft synth strip from the Synth Rack and sets the inputs and MIDI outputs
of all affected tracks to the next lower-numbered option. Cakewalk does not delete the affected tracks.
Note: If you’re using a ReWire instrument and not a soft synth, always close the ReWire instrument’s interface before you delete
the instrument from Cakewalk, or before you close Cakewalk.

Playing a soft synth

Muting and soloing soft synth tracks
Cakewalk automatically places any synth and MIDI tracks that use soft synths into a group that makes muting and soloing the tracks
easy:

 To mute or solo a MIDI track that is patched to a synth track, simply mute or solo the MIDI track—Cakewalk automatically mutes
or solos the correct synth track. If another MIDI track uses the synth track as an output, Cakewalk leaves the synth track unmuted.

 To mute or solo all the MIDI tracks that are patched to a specific soft synth, simply mute or solo the synth track that the MIDI
tracks are patched into.—Cakewalk automatically mutes or solos all the correct MIDI tracks.
Or

 Click the M or S buttons (mute and solo, respectively) next to the soft synth’s name in the Synth Rack view. This mutes or solos all
the tracks associated with this instance of the soft synth.

 Click the Solo button

on the soft synth’s property page. The Solo button functions the exact same way as the Solo button on

the source track/bus.
You can use the Mute and Solo buttons in the Track view, Synth Rack, or Console view.

Note: By default, Smart Mute is not enabled for Split Instrument Tracks. This allows you to individually mute individual split MIDI/
audio tracks for soft synths. If you want to enable Smart Mute for Split Instrument Tracks, open the Synth Rack view, click the
Synth Settings menu and select Enable Smart Mute on the drop-down menu.

Rename synths in the Synth Rack view
It is possible to rename synth in the Synth Rack view. This is especially useful if you use many instances of a particular synth and
you need to distinguish each instance.

To rename a synth
Double click the Name field of the synth you want to rename.

Multi-port soft synths
A multi-port soft synth allows you the option of using a different synth track for every output that the soft synth has. This allows you
to use different plug-in effects for each sound (or in some cases, group of sounds) that a soft synth produces. For example, if a soft
synth can produce 16 sounds at the same time, and has 4 outputs, you can send any of the 16 sounds out through any of 4 different
outputs, giving you a choice of 4 different plug-in configurations for that soft synth. You would use 4 different synth tracks: one for
each output. If a soft synth can produce 8 sounds at the same time, and has 8 outputs, you could use 8 synth tracks and 8 plug-in
configurations. If you need more plug-in configurations or just more sounds, you can insert more copies of the same soft synth, using
new synth tracks for all of the new copy’s outputs. You can also send all the MIDI tracks out the same output and synth track if you
don’t need separate plug-ins for each sound, or just want to use the soft synth’s internal effects.
The Insert Soft Synth Options dialog box gives you the option of automatically creating a separate synth track for each audio
output that the soft synth has, or creating just one synth track for Output 1 of that particular soft synth. Each new copy (also called an
instance) of a soft synth is considered to be a separate instrument, and appears in a separate row in the Synth Rack, with a number
after its name representing which copy it is.

Converting your soft synth tracks to audio
Once your project sounds the way you want it to, it’s extremely easy to convert your soft synth MIDI tracks to either new audio
tracks, or Wave, MP3, or other exported files.
You can also do a temporary conversion, called freezing. See “Freeze tracks and synths” on page 1006 for more information.

To convert your soft synth tracks to new audio tracks
1. Mute all tracks that you don’t want to convert.
2. Click the Track view Tracks menu and choose Bounce to Track(s).
The Bounce to Track(s) dialog box appears.
3. In the Destination field, choose a new or pre-existing track to put the new audio data on.
4. If you’ve saved presets from previous bounce operations, you can choose a preset from the Preset field.
5. In the Source Category field, choose Tracks.
6. In the Channel Format field, choose mono if you want a mono track, stereo if you want a stereo track, and split mono if you
want to create separate mono tracks.
7. In the Sources list, choose the tracks or output bus(es) that the soft synth tracks are using (usually the main outputs).
8. Under Mix and Render, make sure all choices are selected.
9. Click OK.
Cakewalk creates new audio tracks from the outputs you selected. When you’re through converting, don’t forget to mute your MIDI
tracks so you won’t hear them and the new audio track(s) at the same time.

Note: You control the bit depth of all rendering operations (bouncing, freezing, applying effects) in Edit > Preferences > File Audio Data, in the Render Bit Depth field. The default value of 32 is the best for most situations. See “Bit depths for rendering
audio” on page 1361 for more information.

To export your soft synth tracks as Wave, MP3, or other type files
1. Mute all tracks that you don’t want to export; make sure you don’t mute the synth track or the audio track that the soft synth is
patched into, or the MIDI track(s) that you are using as a source.
2. Use the File > Export > Audio command.
The Export Audio dialog box appears.
3. Under Filename and Location, specify the location where you want to save the exported file(s).
4. Type a file name in the File Name field.
5. Under Format, specify the type of file, the format, and the bit depth of the new file you’re creating—for MP3 use 16 bits.
6. Under Mix and Render, make sure all choices are selected.
7. Click Export.
Cakewalk creates a new audio file of the type you specified. Find the file in the folder you specified, and double-click it to listen to it.

Using the Assignable Controls feature
You can create knobs on the Synth Rack to control any of a synth’s automatable parameters (each knob learns what parameter to
control when you create the knob). This makes it easy to adjust the controls that you use most often on a particular synth, and also
lets you record automation from the Synth Rack. After you create some control knobs, the next time you insert the same synth, you
can choose to display the same control knobs that you used previously.
You can also group control knobs on the Synth Rack, and use Remote Control to move the knobs.

To create control knobs on the Synth Rack
1. Undock the Synth Rack view from the Browser or dock it in the MultiDock. Assignable controls can not be shown when the
Browser is docked at the left or right side.
2. In the synth’s strip of controls in the Synth Rack, click the Assign Controls button to enable it.
3. While the Assign Controls button is enabled, click on each control in the synth’s property page that you want to create a knob
for.
4. When you’re finished clicking on controls, click the Assign Controls button to disable it.
The Synth Rack displays knobs for the controls you selected, with the each knob’s name displayed below each knob. Now you can
adjust some of the synth’s parameters by moving the appropriate knob in the Synth Rack.

Automating controls from the Synth Rack

Note: Your synth’s manufacturer determines which controls (if any) you can automate. If your synth does not expose its controls
to Cakewalk, you can not automate the synth.
Once you create some control knobs on the Synth Rack, you can record automation from them. Use the same procedure you would
use to record automation of any other Cakewalk knob or widget. See “Recording individual fader or knob movements” on page 1214
and “Displaying Synth Rack automation” on page 960 for more information
You can also draw and edit synth automation in the Clips pane. See “Drawing soft synth automation in the Clips pane” on page 960
for more information.
See also:
“Recording a soft synth’s MIDI output” on page 961

Displaying Synth Rack automation
You can choose what track you want a synth’s automation to appear in for editing. Use the Automation Track menu in each strip of
controls in the Synth Rack to choose what track you want to display the synth’s automation on. You can display the automation from
several different synths on the same track, or put a synth’s automation on a track that is completely unrelated to the synth if you
want.
See “Synth Rack” on page 946 for a picture of the Synth Rack and all its components.
See also:
“Recording a soft synth’s MIDI output” on page 961

Remote control of the Synth Rack
Once you create some control knobs on the Synth Rack, you can assign knobs or sliders on your MIDI controller to control the Synth
Rack knobs.
See “Using remote control” on page 1046 for more information.

Drawing soft synth automation in the Clips pane
Some synths have controls that you can automate by drawing envelopes in the Track view.

To automate a soft synth’s controls in the Clips pane
In the Synth Rack, the Automation Track menu in a particular synth’s control strip displays the track that this synth’s automation
appears in. Click this track’s Edit Filter control and choose the desired synth parameter on the pop-up menu.
Cakewalk draws an envelope for the parameter that you chose. You can edit the envelope to make the parameter behave as you
want it to.

Soft synth MIDI output support
Some soft synths produce MIDI output as well as audio output. You can now record the MIDI output of both VST and DirectX
instruments that have this feature.

Recording a soft synth’s MIDI output
Cakewalk allows you to record the MIDI output of a synth onto another MIDI track in your project. This can be convenient if your
synth creates arpeggios, drum patterns, or other MIDI data that you want to edit as a MIDI clip.

To enable MIDI outputs on a synth
 When inserting a synth from the Insert menu or the Synth Rack, select the Enable MIDI Output check box in the Insert Soft
Synth Options dialog box.
The soft synth will now appear as an Input option on all MIDI tracks just like any hardware inputs.

To hear a soft synth’s MIDI output through another track
1. Verify that Enable MIDI Output is enabled for the synth whose MIDI output you want to hear through another track.
2. On a new MIDI track in your project, set the Input to the synth whose MIDI output you want to hear.
3. Set the Output of that track to another synth or MIDI output used in your project and enable Input Echo.
4. Play some MIDI data through the synth whose MIDI Output has been enabled.
The MIDI data sent from that synth will be echoed through the Output of the new MIDI track.

To record a soft synth’s MIDI output to a track
1. Verify that Enable MIDI Output is enabled for the synth whose MIDI output you want to record.
2. On a new MIDI track in your project, set the Input to the synth whose MIDI output you want to record and arm the track.
3. Click the Record button to start recording.
4. If you’re recording live MIDI input through the synth, place track focus on the synth’s MIDI track and begin playing your MIDI
controller. If you’re recording pre-existing MIDI data through the synth, record through the duration of the pre-existing clips.
The MIDI Output of the synth will be recorded to the new MIDI track. You can then edit the MIDI data and route it to a different MIDI
output as you see fit.
Note: Be careful to avoid creating a MIDI feedback loop. To prevent this, make sure the Input of a soft synth’s MIDI track is not
set to the same synth’s Output.

ReWire
Cakewalk can send MIDI events to any object in a ReWire client application on as many MIDI channels as the client application
makes available.
See:
“ReWire instruments” on page 962
“Inserting a ReWire instrument” on page 963
“Routing MIDI data to ReWire instruments” on page 964

ReWire instruments
ReWire is a technology for transferring audio data between software applications in real time—the software equivalent of a multichannel audio cable. ReWire is built on the following cornerstones:

 Real-time audio streaming between applications
 Sample accurate synchronization
 Common transport functionality
Cakewalk supports the ReWire 2.0 format, but with some differences. Cakewalk interacts with ReWire applications in the following
ways:

 You can insert one instance of a ReWire application into each Cakewalk project.
 You can use as many MIDI channels and devices in each ReWire application as that application makes available.
 You can insert ReWire devices into Cakewalk projects from the Synth Rack or Insert menu, and you can tell Cakewalk to create
the necessary synth tracks and one MIDI track at that time. You can also tell Cakewalk to open the ReWire application’s property
page, because, unlike synths, ReWire applications must have their property pages (interfaces) open in order to function.

 Cakewalk’s tempo, transport, and loop points are linked to the ReWire application. Activating or changing any of these settings in
the ReWire application(s) changes the same setting in Cakewalk, and vice versa. If you have several applications open and you
make a change in one of them, it may be necessary to put the focus on the other application(s) to update their interfaces.

 You cannot send patch or bank changes from Cakewalk to the ReWire application. All other track property controls in Cakewalk
control the ReWire device, except the pan controls on MIDI tracks. The pan controls on Cakewalk’s synth tracks control the
ReWire device’s panning.

 You can mix down or bounce ReWire tracks in Cakewalk the same way you mix down or bounce synth tracks.
 You can use Cakewalk’s automation functions on both synth and MIDI tracks that the ReWire application uses.
 Muting or soloing a synth track that a ReWire device uses automatically mutes or solos the MIDI track that feeds that synth track.
Muting or soloing a MIDI track that a ReWire device uses will mute or solo the corresponding synth track only if there is only one
MIDI track feeding that synth track.

 You must always close your ReWire application(s) before you close Cakewalk. Some ReWire applications prevent Cakewalk from
closing properly if the ReWire applications are still open.
For step-by-step procedures, see:
“Inserting a ReWire instrument” on page 963

ReWire

Inserting a ReWire instrument
After you install your ReWire applications and reboot your computer, the names of the ReWire applications appear in Cakewalk’s
Insert menu under ReWire Devices, and also in the Synth Rack’s Insert button pop-up menu.
Note: ReWire supports both 32-bit and 64-bit programs, but it is not possible to mix the two environments. A 32-bit program
and a 64-bit program cannot communicate via ReWire. Make sure you load the correct version of your ReWire device,
depending on whether you are using the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Cakewalk.

To insert a ReWire instrument
1. Open a Cakewalk project. Do not launch your ReWire application.
2. In the Synth Rack, click the Insert button, and click ReWire Devices to display the submenu of installed ReWire devices.
OR
Use the Insert > ReWire Devices command to display the submenu of installed ReWire devices.
3. Click the name of the ReWire device you want to insert.
The Insert Soft Synth Options dialog box appears.
4. Choose options from the Insert Soft Synth Options dialog box according to the following:

 If you want to create a MIDI track that uses the ReWire Instrument as an output, select the Create These Tracks: MIDI
Source check box.

 If you want to create a single synth track that acts as an output for Output 1 of the ReWire Instrument, select the Create
These Tracks: First Synth Audio Output check box.

 If you want to create separate synth tracks for each of the ReWire Instrument’s outputs, select the Create These Tracks: All
Synth Audio Outputs check box.

 If you want to use existing MIDI and audio tracks to play the ReWire Instrument, uncheck all of the Create These Tracks
options. Cakewalk adds the ReWire Instrument to the audio track Input and MIDI track Output menus. You need to set an
existing audio track’s Input field to the ReWire Instrument, and set an existing MIDI track’s Output field to the ReWire
Instrument. The existing audio track will then become a synth track.

 If you want to open the ReWire Instrument’s interface from this dialog box, select the Open These Windows: Synth Property
Page check box (always check this option: ReWire Instruments do not sound unless their property pages are open).

 If you opened this dialog box from the Insert menu and want to open the Synth Rack, select the Open These Windows:
Synth Rack View check box.

 If you want to open this dialog box every time you use the Insert > ReWire Instrument command, or click the Insert button in
the Synth Rack and choose a ReWire instrument from the pop-up menu, select the Ask This Every Time check box. If you
always insert ReWire Instruments in the same way, you can uncheck this option so you don’t have to deal with the dialog box
each time. To open the dialog box when the option is unchecked, click the Insert Soft Synth Options button
Rack.

5. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Cakewalk adds your ReWire devices to the audio and synth track Input menus and the MIDI track Output and Channel menus,
creates any tracks you requested, adds the ReWire instrument to the Synth Rack, and opens the ReWire application’s interface.
6. In the MIDI track whose output is the ReWire synth track, click the drop-down arrow in the Channel field to display the names of
the available ReWire devices in your ReWire instrument.
7. Click the name of the device you want to use.
8. Make sure that the synth track you want to hear the ReWire instrument through has the appropriate ReWire channel listed in its
Input field.
Now you can record MIDI data in the MIDI track and hear it through the synth track. If you want to use different synth tracks for each
ReWire device, see the following procedure.
Note: Always close your ReWire applications before closing a Cakewalk project.

To use separate synth tracks for each ReWire device
1. Open Cakewalk, insert a ReWire instrument, and choose the All Synth Audio Outputs option in the Create These Tracks field
of the Insert Soft Synth Options dialog box. Make sure you choose to open the Synth window, and click OK.
Cakewalk inserts the ReWire instrument and creates multiple synth tracks.
2. In your ReWire application, assign the devices you want to use to the outputs or channels you want to use. For example, in
Propellerheads Reason, you use the back panel of the mixer to drag cables from a device to the output channel you want to use
for that instrument.
3. In Cakewalk, set the Output field of a MIDI track to the name of your ReWire application, and set the Channel field to the name
of the ReWire device you want to play with this track.
4. Record some MIDI data in the track and play it. Find the synth track whose Input field lists the output channel you patched your
device into—the playback meter lights up as you play the MIDI track that plays your device.
Now you can use separate effects for each of your ReWire devices.
Note: Always close your ReWire applications before closing a Cakewalk project.

Routing MIDI data to ReWire instruments
Some ReWire applications can create large numbers of instruments. You can send a track’s MIDI data to any of these instruments
by selecting the specific instrument in the MIDI channel menu of the relevant track.

To send MIDI data to a specific ReWire instrument
1. In the Cakewalk MIDI track that contains the recorded MIDI data you want to send, make sure that the Output menu is set to the
correct ReWire device.
2. Then use the Ch menu in the same track to choose the instrument you want to send to. This also works if you just want to use
this track to play your MIDI controller through a particular instrument in the ReWire application.

Mixing down ReWire instruments
To either mix down or bounce ReWire instruments to new audio tracks, use the same procedures as for synths.

ReWire troubleshooting guide
The following lists some common issues when you use ReWire with Cakewalk:

 Cakewalk Won’t Close Properly. Always close your ReWire applications before closing Cakewalk or a Cakewalk project.
 Rebirth Won’t Play After I Open Its Property Page. Make sure that the Loop switch in Rebirth is enabled.
 My ReWire Project Plays at a Different Tempo when Opened from Cakewalk. When you open a ReWire project from
Cakewalk, the ReWire project assumes Cakewalk’s default tempo, which is 100. Change Cakewalk’s tempo to match your
ReWire project.

 My MIDI Controller Works in Cakewalk or my ReWire Application, but not Both. Choose different MIDI In ports for both
Cakewalk and your ReWire application. Do this in Cakewalk by using the Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices command, and
highlighting the MIDI In port you want to use in Cakewalk. If you only have one MIDI In port on your MIDI interface or sound card,
enable that input in either Cakewalk or your ReWire application, and disable that input in the other application.

 I Get a MIDI Input Error Message When I Open a ReWire Application. If you only have one MIDI Input port on your MIDI
interface, you probably have that one reserved for Cakewalk, leaving none for your ReWire application. If you would rather use
your MIDI controller in the ReWire application instead of Cakewalk, you can deselect your MIDI input port in Edit >
Preferences > MIDI - Devices, and then select that MIDI Input from whatever menu your ReWire application has for that
purpose. If you have multiple inputs on your MIDI interface, simply select different ones for Cakewalk and your ReWire
application.

ReWire and fast forwarding in Cakewalk
When there is a ReWire application loaded into a Cakewalk project, the Cakewalk Fast Forward button/command only works if
there is a clip at the end of the Cakewalk project or if Stop at Project End is not checked.

ReWire tracks silent when using metronome record count-in
When using a metronome count-in and recording, any ReWire tracks will be silent at the start of recording. The silence period will
equal the count-in duration. To fix this issue, disable metronome count-in (go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Metronome and set
Record Count-in to 0).

Soft synth audio recording
In addition to recording a performance as MIDI data, you can also record a soft synth’s audio output to any audio track in real-time.
This allows you to treat a soft synth like an external hardware synthesizer.
If your project contains any soft synths, each soft synth audio output will be exposed as an audio track input source. If your soft synth
has multiple outputs, you can record the audio from each output onto a separate audio track.
You can choose to record just the audio output, or record both the MIDI input and audio output simultaneously on separate tracks.
Note: If you record both the MIDI input and audio output, you will want to mute one of the tracks during playback in order to avoid
doubled audio and potential phasing issues.
There are many reasons why you might want to record a soft synth’s audio output, including:

 Capture all the nuances of your performance real-time.
 Use Cakewalk’s advanced audio tools to process the synth (AudioSnap, VocalSync, envelope automation, etc.).
 Create Groove clips from the synth performance.
 Play back MIDI performance while manipulating controls in the soft synth UI. This is especially convenient if you want to
manipulate controls in the soft synth that are not automatable.

Instrument track types
The workflow for recording audio from a soft synth differs slightly depending on the instrument track type your project uses.
Cakewalk supports two different instrument track types:

 Simple Instrument Tracks. Simple Instrument Tracks combine a soft synth’s MIDI input and main audio output in a single track
strip. You can only record MIDI data onto a Simple Instrument Track. In order to record the soft synth’s audio output, you must
record to a separate audio track.

 Split Instrument Tracks. With Split Instrument Tracks, you can create a separate audio track for each of the soft synth’s
available outputs, plus a single MIDI source track. You can record the soft synth’s audio output directly to the split audio tracks.
You specify the desired instrument track type in the Soft Synth Options dialog box when you insert a new soft synth. For details,
see “Inserting soft synths” on page 948 and “Insert Soft Synth Options dialog” on page 1642.
Simple Instrument Tracks and Split Instrument Tracks can easily be identified by their different default track icons. Splits instruments
also contain a Waveform Preview button

, while Simple Instrument Tracks have an Input Echo button

.

Note: It is possible to not create any tracks when you insert a soft synth, in which case the synth is only shown in the Synth Rack
view (see “Using the Synth Rack” on page 739). In order to record audio from a soft synth that only appears in the Synth Rack,
you must first insert at least one MIDI track and one audio track and assign the MIDI track output and audio track input to the
soft synth. For details, see “Inserting tracks” on page 478.

Triggering a soft synth in real-time
There are several ways to trigger a soft synth in real-time while recording:

 From an external MIDI controller (see “To play a soft synth from a MIDI controller” on page 956).
 From Cakewalk’s virtual on-screen keyboard controller (see “Virtual Controller/Keyboard” on page 1881).
 By interacting with the soft synth’s UI (see “Opening a soft synth’s property page” on page 954).
 By playing back recorded MIDI data (see “To play a soft synth with recorded MIDI data” on page 955).
To record audio only
You can treat a soft synth like an external hardware synthesizer and record only the synth audio instead of the MIDI performance.
Using Simple Instrument Tracks:
1. Insert a new audio track to record the soft synth’s audio onto. For details, see “Inserting tracks” on page 478.
2. Click the audio track’s Input control to show all available inputs, then point to the name of the soft synth you want to record and
select the desired synth output. The Input control is available in the Track Inspector, Track view, and Console view. For details,
see “Choosing an input” on page 353.
3. Arm the audio track for recording. For details, see “Arming tracks for recording” on page 355.
4. Begin recording. For details, see “To Record Audio” on page 363.

To prevent MIDI and audio doubling during playback
If you have recorded both MIDI input and synth audio output on separate tracks, you must mute the recorded MIDI data in order to
avoid doubling and phase issues during playback. You can completely mute the synth MIDI track, or mute individual Take Lanes.
Make sure the Enable Smart Mute option is disabled in the Synth Rack Synth Settings menu to avoid also muting any related
audio tracks (see “Smart Mute for Split Instrument Tracks” on page 968 and “Muting and soloing soft synth tracks” on page 957).

Smart Mute for Split Instrument Tracks
When a virtual instrument MIDI track is soloed or muted, Cakewalk automatically manages muting or soloing the related set of audio/
MIDI tracks in order to properly playback the soloed/muted tracks.
In order to facilitate audio recording on Split Instrument Tracks, Smart Mute is no longer the default behavior for Split Instrument
Tracks. By default, you can now individually mute individual split MIDI/audio tracks for soft synths.
If you want to enable Smart Mute for Split Instrument Tracks, open the Synth Rack view, click the Synth Settings menu and select
Enable Smart Mute on the drop-down menu.

Soft synth audio recording

Punch recording
Unlike recording hardware inputs, where input is always present, audio generated from a soft synth will always be delayed by at
minimum one buffer size. This is due to pre-roll buffering. As a result, audio from a soft synth can only be recorded after this buffer
has been processed by the synth.
During normal recording and punch recording, Cakewalk compensates for pre-roll buffering and places the recorded audio at the
correct position on the timeline to ensure it is in sync with MIDI events. However, if you punch in on-the-fly (enabling Record during
playback), you are technically punching in into the future (PunchTime + 1 buffer). This is normally unnoticeable at low latencies.
When punch recording, the current Record Mode determines whether you hear recorded audio or live audio while recording. To only
hear the live audio while punch recording, use the Overwrite record mode.

“Punch recording” on page 370

Stand-alone synths
Some soft synths can be run independently of Cakewalk and do not need to be inserted to the Synth Rack or an FX Rack to use.
After you install this kind of synth and restart your computer, the name of the synth’s MIDI driver appears in Cakewalk’s MIDI
Devices dialog box under Outputs.
See:
“Playing a stand-alone synth” on page 970
“Recording a stand-alone synth” on page 971

Playing a stand-alone synth
Cakewalk plays this kind of synth by seeing it as additional MIDI outputs in both the MIDI Devices dialog box and in MIDI tracks’
Output fields.

To play a stand-alone synth
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices.
2. In the Outputs field, make sure the name of your stand-alone synth’s MIDI driver is highlighted, and click OK.
3. Click the Output field of an unused MIDI track to display the Output menu.
4. Select the name of the stand-alone synth’s MIDI driver.
5. If your stand-alone synth is multi-timbral, change the track’s MIDI channel to the same one that the synth uses for the sound you
want to hear.
6. Select a bank and patch on your stand-alone synth, if you haven’t already.
7. Record some MIDI data in the MIDI track, or play any MIDI controller that’s an input for the MIDI track.
When you play your MIDI controller or play back the recorded MIDI data, you should hear the stand-alone synth through your sound
card’s outputs. If you don’t, make sure you’re playing in the right range and that your monitor speakers or headphones are turned up,
and that none of the relevant tracks are muted.
See:
“Recording a stand-alone synth” on page 971

Stand-alone synths

Recording a stand-alone synth
There are several ways to record a stand-alone synth:

 You can use the synth’s wave capture function, if it has one. See your synth’s documentation for a procedure. Make a note of
where the resulting captured Wave file is stored, and then you can import the file into Cakewalk by using the File > Import >
Audio command.

 You can connect your sound card’s outputs to your sound card’s inputs, either internally or externally, depending on your sound
card’s design. After you do this, you need to arm an audio track in Cakewalk and select one of your sound card’s wave drivers as
an input. Start recording, and make sure the MIDI track that is routed to the synth is playing back.

 You can use your sound card’s wave capture or what-you-hear option, if it has one. See the following procedure.
To record a stand-alone synth with your sound card’s Wave Capture function
1. Pick a destination audio track and set the Input field to Stereo.
Note: If you have more than one sound card installed, select the one that your stand-alone synth uses as an output.

2. Arm the destination track.
3. Mute or archive any tracks that you don’t want to record to the destination track.
4. If Cakewalk’s metronome is set to use any software synth to produce a click, disable the recording metronome. To do so, click
the Record Metronome button
in the Control Bar’s Transport module, or go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Metronome
and clear the Recording check box.
5. Open your sound card's mixer device. This is normally done by double-clicking the speaker icon on the Windows taskbar, or by
choosing Start > Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Volume Control in Windows 7.
Note: Some sound cards, such as the SoundBlaster Live, have their own proprietary mixer. If yours has one, please use it
instead.
6. Click Adjust Volume For Recording, and make sure all boxes below are checked.
7. Click OK, and locate the slider marked MIDI, Synth, Mixed Input, or What You Hear. Select the Select check box at the bottom,
then close the window.
8. In Cakewalk, click the Record button.
Cakewalk records all the MIDI tracks that are assigned to the stand-alone synth as a stereo audio track.
After you finish recording, mute the MIDI tracks that you just recorded so you don’t hear them and the new audio track at the same
time.

information.
Meters are helpful in determining the relative volumes of your audio tracks and in detecting and preventing overload. By default, the
Console view displays output level meters in main out modules at all times, and displays record level meters in individual tracks
whenever they are armed and have an audio input. The display of meters, however, can place a considerable load on your
computer. Showing only the peak indicators, or hiding the meters entirely, can reduce the load on your computer. This may increase
the number of audio tracks and real-time effects you can play back at one time.
In the Track view, there are several ways to configure which tracks are displayed.

To hide selected tracks

Routing and mixing digital audio
Any audio track can be tapped, before or after the track volume control, and sent to one or more buses. A bus can tap any number
of audio tracks. Each track’s data passes through the track’s send level knob on its way to the bus. This is shown in the following
figure.

A
B

D

C
A. Send enable button: must be lit to send track data to bus B. Pre-fader: output level to Bus 1 is not affected by the track’s volume fader C. Postfader: track’s volume fader controls output level to Bus 2 D. This track is routed to Bus 1 and Bus 2

The audio in each bus is processed by the input gain and pan controls (main output buses don’t have these controls), then
processed by any real-time effects you have patched, sent through the bus output level and pan controls, and then sent to the
designated main out, in stereo. You can also insert a send control on a bus, and send the bus signal to another bus, or route the
output of a bus to another bus.
At each main out, all audio data from audio tracks and buses that were routed to that main are mixed together. Finally, the data
passes through each main’s master volume fader.

“Hardware outs” on page 985
“Signal flow” on page 980
“Buses” on page 983
“Surround buses” on page 984

located at the bottom of the Track view.)

The name of the effect you have chosen appears in the bus FX Rack.
3. Set the effect’s parameters and close it.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for any additional effects you want to use.
5. In the Console view or Track Inspector, select the channel strip that you want to patch through the bus, then do the following:

 Drag the Bus Send Level control for the bus to the approximate level you want.
 Drag the Bus Send Pan to the approximate setting you want.
 Click the Bus Enable button for the appropriate bus.
6. Repeat step 5 for all the tracks you want to patch through the bus.
7. In the bus, adjust the Input Gain and Output Volume controls to the approximate level you want.
8. In the bus, drag the Input Pan and Output Pan controls to the approximate positions you want.
9. Play your tracks and adjust the Send Level controls, the Pan controls, etc.

To mute or solo a bus
Each bus has a Mute button and a Solo button. These controls act like the Mute and Solo buttons in a track, but they affect all the
signal routed through the bus.
1. Open the Track view, Track Inspector or Console view.
2. Click the Mute or Solo button in the bus you want to mute or solo.

Bus selection
As with tracks, buses can be selected in both the Track View and the Console View. The current selection can contain a mixture of

Insert Send Assistant
The Insert Send Assistant makes it fast and easy to create headphone mixes, effect buses and insert sends to new or existing
buses.

To open the Insert Send Assistant
 Right-click on a track or bus and select Insert Send > Insert Send Assistant from the pop-up menu.
The Insert Send Assistant dialog box opens.
Figure 437. The Insert Send Assistant dialog box.

The Insert Send Assistant dialog box has the following options:
Send to Existing Bus. This option lets you assign a new send to an existing bus in the current project. Select the desired bus from
the drop-down list.
The New Bus Options section is unavailable when Send to Existing Bus is selected.
New Bus. This option lets you assign a new send to a new stereo or surround bus. When selected, you can use the New Bus
Options section to specify stereo or surround, the bus name and other settings (see “New bus options” on page 986).
Pre Fader. When Pre Fader is selected, the send signal is before the channel volume fader. As a result, the send level going to the
bus does not change when the channel fader changes. Pre Fader is preferred when you want to create separate mixes, such as
unique headphone mixes for different performers. By default, the send signal is post fader and comes after the channel volume
fader. As a result, the send level going to the bus changes when the channel fader changes. Use post fader if you want to create an
effect bus. Doing so allows you to maintain a consistent balance between the “wet” and “dry” signals as you adjust the channel fader.
Match Track’s Gain and Pan. When Match Track’s Pan and Gain is selected, the newly created send will have Gain and Pan
settings that match those of the strip's Main Gain and Pan. As a result, the headphone mix matches the main mix, and from there
you can adjust the headphone mix as desired.
Note: The Match Track’s Pan and Gain setting does not affect sends that are assigned to surround buses.

New bus options
When you select New Bus, the following settings can be configured:

 Stereo. This option lets you assign a new send to a new stereo bus.
 Surround. This option lets you assign a new send to a new surround bus.

Patch points
A patch point is an internal routing path used to route audio from a track output, bus output, or send to an audio track input. The
virtual inputs can then be input monitored or recorded. You can think of patch points as virtual patch cables.
You can freely create, assign, and rename patch points. This powerful internal routing tool opens up a new dimension of control
within Cakewalk. Use patch points for track-to-track, bus-to-track, and send-to-track routing, and to record audio signals that can
normally not be recorded to an audio track, such as bus outputs, send effects, the metronome, etc.
Cakewalk automatically prevents assigning patch points that will cause a feedback loop.

The following are a few ideas for how you can use patch points:

 Work exclusively in the Track view and have folders of tracks with their Aux tracks adjacent to them. This workflow can be used as
an alternative to routing tracks to buses.

 Record a vocal track with effects to another track. For details, see “To record an audio track that contains effects” on page 994.
 Record two or more background vocal tracks to a single track. Aux tracks can be used instead of buses for busing or effects
sends. For details, see “To record multiple tracks to a single track” on page 995.

 Record only the effect bus of a vocal track. For details, see “To record only the send effects on an audio track” on page 995.
 Record the metronome to an audio track. For details, see “To record the metronome to an audio track” on page 996.
 Control multiple audio track volumes with one fader. For details, see “Control multiple audio track volumes with one fader” on
page 996.

 Capture the performance of guitar effects in real-time. For details, see “Capture the performance of guitar effects in real-time” on
page 997.

 Control surfaces that don’t support buses can instead control Aux tracks.
 Record time-based effects in real-time.
 Record plug-in parameter changes that are not automatable.
 Record a bus to an audio track.
 Record complex reverbs and delays in real-time.

Aux tracks
To streamline the workflow for patch points, Cakewalk supports Aux tracks. Aux tracks are used to receive audio from other tracks,
buses, or sends.
Stereo buses are traditionally used for sub-grouping and effect sends, but it is possible to use Aux tracks for the same purpose. Aux
tracks have the added advantage of being able to record the incoming audio (mono or stereo), and you can arrange Aux tracks
adjacent to other tracks in the Track pane or Console view.
An Aux track is a regular audio track that has been automatically assigned to a patch point input. If you rename an Aux track,
Cakewalk will also rename the assigned patch point.

To create an Aux track
Click the Output control for the audio track, bus, or send you want to route to a new Aux track, then select New Aux Track on the
pop-up menu.

The New Aux Track command functions as a time-saving macro. When you create a new Aux track, Cakewalk does the following
automatically:

 Creates a new patch point named Aux n (where “n” is a sequential number).
 Assigns the source track/bus/send output to the new patch point.
 Creates a new audio track named Aux n (same name as the patch point). If you rename the Aux track, Cakewalk will
automatically rename the corresponding patch point.

 Assigns the new audio track’s Input to the new patch point
 Enables Input Echo on the new audio track.
 Assigns a default Aux track icon.
You can now freely assign other tracks, buses, and sends to the Aux n patch point.

To create a new patch point
Do one of the following:

 Click an audio track or bus Output control and select New Patch Point on the pop-up menu.
 Click an audio track Input control and select New Patch Point on the pop-up menu.
 Right-click track or bus and select Insert Send > New Patch Point.
 Click the Insert Send button

at the top of the Sends module in the Console view or Inspector, then select New Patch Point on

the pop-up menu.

When you create a new Aux track, both sides of the connection are automatically made. However, when you create a new patch
point, only one side of the connection is automatically made. The new patch point is assigned to the Input, Output, or Send you used
to create the patch point. You must manually assign the other end of the patch point to complete the connection.

Tip: You can use Quick Grouping to assign multiple tracks/buses/sends simultaneously to a patch point. To do so, select multiple tracks
or buses, then hold down the CTRL key while you assign or create the patch point. For more information about Quick Groups, see
“Quick Groups” on page 1044. If you create a new patch point while holding down the CTRL key, all sends/outputs or inputs will be
assigned to the newly created patch point.

If you rename an Aux track, the corresponding patch point will inherit the same name. If you rename a patch point independently
from the Aux track, the patch point will no longer subsequently follow the Aux track name.

To assign an existing patch point
Do one of the following:

 Click an audio track or bus Output control and select an unassigned patch point on the pop-up menu.
 Click an audio track Input control, point to an unassigned patch point, then select the patch point’s left, right, or stereo channel on
the pop-up menu.

 Click a Send control and select an unassigned patch point on the pop-up menu.

Note: Cakewalk automatically prevents assigning patch points that will cause a feedback loop. Input and Output menus will not
show any patch point choices that would result in feedback.

Tip: You can use Quick Grouping to assign multiple tracks/buses/sends simultaneously to a patch point. To do so, select multiple tracks
or buses, then hold down the CTRL key while you assign or create the patch point. For more information about Quick Groups, see

To bounce/export audio that uses patch points
To bounce/export a project containing patch points, select all tracks that contribute to the mix. For example, if the project contains
three audio tracks that send to an Aux track, you must include the Aux track as well as all contributing tracks prior to performing the
bounce/export.

Patch point and Aux track Smart Solo
When you solo an Aux track or bus that outputs to a patch point, Cakewalk will automatically manage the solo state for all upstream
and downstream tracks/buses. This eliminates the need to manually solo or mute other tracks when using patch points.
How this works is best explained with a few examples:

 Soloing a track that routes to one or more patch points via an Output or Send control (directly or indirectly) will make all
downstream patch points in the circuit audible. For example:

Soloing Track 1 will make Aux 1 audible.

 Soloing a track that has its Input control assigned to a patch point will automatically make all upstream tracks or buses audible.
For example:

Soloing Aux 1 will make both Track 1 and Track 2 audible. You can still solo and mute Track 1 and Track 2 independently in this
scenario.

 Soloing a bus that routes to one or more patch points via an Output or Send control (directly or indirectly) will make all
downstream patch points in the circuit audible. For example:

Soloing Bus A will make Aux 1 as well as Track 1 audible.

998

Mixing
Patch points

 Soloing a bus that an Aux track outputs to will automatically make all upstream tracks or buses audible. For example:

Soloing Master will make Track 1, Track 2 and Aux 1 audible. You can still solo and mute Track 1 and Track 2 independently in
this scenario.

 Soloing tracks chained to multiple patch points / aux tracks. For example:

Solo Aux 2 and also Track 2 will sound only Track 2.

Note: All upstream or downstream tracks that are muted as a result of soloing an Aux track are dimmed in the Clips pane to
indicate that these tracks will not be heard. This makes it very easy to visually see the result of muting an Aux track. Tracks are
not dimmed as a result of soloing buses.

Backwards compatibility
Projects that contain patch points and Aux tracks cannot be opened in Cakewalk versions prior to Cakewalk Jamaica Plain (Update
9). If you need to open a project in an earlier version, first make a backup of the project, then unassign any patch points and resave
the project.
To unassign a patch point input, set audio track inputs referencing patch points to None.
To unassign a patch point output, set any track/bus outputs referencing patch points to a different bus or None.

Metering
The Console view, Track views and Track Inspector all have meters to measure playback level, record level, bus output level, and
main output level. You can configure the meters differently in each view, if you want.
The responsiveness of your record meters (which also measure input monitoring) is dependent upon the latency setting in Edit >
Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings and the settings Edit > Preferences > Customization - Audio Meters. With higher latency
settings the meters may appear sluggish.
There are three basic things you should know about meters:

 What the meters measure
 How to show or hide different kinds of meters
 How to choose display options for each kind of meter
Note: Metering uses significant amounts of your computer’s processing power, especially RMS metering. If you need to free
up resources, turning off metering where you don’t absolutely need it helps. Using peak metering on tracks and peak plus RMS
metering on the main out is a good option. To disable all metering, turn off metering in both the Track view and Console view.

See:
“What the meters measure” on page 1000
“Hiding and showing meters” on page 1001
“Changing the meters’ display” on page 1002

What the meters measure
The following table summarizes what each kind of meter measures.
Kind of meter

What it measures

Record

The level of the instrument listed as an input for the track you are monitoring—the track must be armed to enable
the meter

Playback

A playback meter measures the playback level of any pre-existing data in the track you are monitoring, either
before or after the track faders, depending on what display options you choose

Main outs

The level of the signal output by each main out.

Buses

The level of the output signal the bus is sending back from the effects.

Peak

Choosing this option causes the meter to display the highest amplitude in the signal that occurs in a
complete cycle of a frequency.

RMS

Choosing this option causes the meter to display more of an average of the amplitudes that occur in
a complete cycle of a frequency. RMS, or Root-Mean-Square, is a little over seventy percent of peak
level.

Peak + RMS

Choosing this option causes the meter to display both the RMS and peak levels. The RMS level is
displayed by the solid bar on the left side of the meter, and the peak level is displayed as a small line
that follows the RMS level just to the right of it.

Pre Fader/Post Fader (This option is for
playback and bus meters only)

Choose Pre Fader or Post Fader to measure the playback level either before or after the track’s or
bus’ volume fader.

Pre Fader/Post FX (This option is for the
buses only)

Choose Pre Fader/Post FX to measure the bus volume before the fader, but after any real-time
effects.

-12 dB....-90 dB

Choosing one of these numbers sets the scale of the meter to a certain range of dB. For example,
choosing -90 dB sets the range of measurement of that meter to 90 dB.
Note: You can also change the scale of a meter by right-clicking the meter to display a pop-up menu
and choosing a new dB range.

Show Labels (Track view only)

Clicking this option hides or shows the dB markings on the meter. Hiding the markings shrinks the
meter significantly, saving space.

Hold Peaks

Choosing this option causes the meter to display a small vertical line (the peak marker) that shows
the peak level and then decays until a new peak is reached.

Lock Peaks

Choosing this option causes the meter to lock the peak marker at the highest level, until a higher level
occurs.

within the limits of your audio hardware drivers, in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings. The second is the settings in
Edit > Preferences > Customization - Audio Meters.
Cakewalk has configurable meter ballistics that allow you to adjust the rise and fall times of both the RMS and Peak Meters. Out of
the box, Cakewalk ships with industry-standard settings that mimic meter ballistics for common hardware consoles.
To adjust the meter performance, go to Edit > Preferences > Customization - Audio Meters and follow these guidelines:

To do this

Do this

Increase or decrease meter refresh rates

Adjust the Refresh rate field. Valid values are from 25 to 250 milliseconds.

Change the decay rate (the amount of time the meter
display stays at its peak)

Adjust the Decay Rate value. Valid values are from 1 to 150 milliseconds.

Increase or decrease the amount of time the meter
displays a peak value

Adjust the Hold Time value. Valid values are from 0 to 5000 milliseconds.

Adjust rise and fall times

Adjust the Rise or Fall settings for RMS or Peak. Valid Rise values are from 0 to 1000
milliseconds. Valid Fall values are from 0 to 2500 milliseconds.

Here are the default values for the various settings:

 Refresh Rate = 40 msec
 Peak Hold – Decay Rate = 50 msec
 Peak Hold – Hold Time = 750 msec
 RMS Rise = 300 msec
 RMS Fall = 300 msec
 Peak Rise = 0 msec
 Peak Fall = 1000 msec

MIDI activity indicators
Each MIDI track displays a MIDI playback meter in the Track view, Track Inspector and Console view. The MIDI meter consists of
two sections:

 MIDI Activity Indicator. The MIDI Activity Indicator lights up whenever a MIDI event is encountered in the track.
 MIDI Velocity Meter. The MIDI Velocity Meter shows the greatest current note velocity encountered during playback.

Peak markers
Buses and audio tracks have a feature called Peak Markers. A Peak Marker in each audio track or bus moves along in the Clips
pane just behind the Now Time cursor displaying the highest peak found during playback. Peak Markers appear in two different
colors: one color if the peak is below 0 dB, and a different color if the peak is above 0 dB. By default, peaks below 0 dB will be green,
and peaks above 0 dB will be red. Colors for both Peak Markers and their text fields are configurable in Edit > Preferences >
Customization - Colors.

To hide or show peak markers globally
 Click the Track view Options menu, point to Meter Options and select Show Track Peak Markers or Show Bus Peak Markers.
To hide or show peak markers on an individual track or bus
 Right-click the track or bus, and choose Show Peak Marker from the pop-up menu.
To jump to a peak marker
 Right-click the numeric peak display in the track/bus header strip, and choose Go To Peak from the context menu (see the
following figure). Doing so will center the peak location and Now time in the Clips pane. This is useful because a Peak Marker
may be offscreen.

Waveform preview for buses and synth tracks
You can choose to display a waveform for the audio output of a bus or synth track. When you enable the display function, the
amplitude of a bus’ or synth track’s audio signal is graphed in real time as a waveform. The waveform turns red wherever clipping is
occurring. Waveform preview allows you to visualize a mix and verify levels over the duration of a project, easily detecting peaks and
other level problems that may require attention. You can choose to display Peak Markers if you want to (see “Peak markers” on page
1005 for more information). If you change the volume of the audio signal and replay the project, the waveform changes to reflect the
new bus or synth track volume.
Each bus or synth track has a Waveform Preview button

Freeze tracks and synths
The Freeze feature allows you to temporarily bounce your track, including soft synths and effects, to reduce the amount of CPU
power needed. The Freeze feature also works for synths patched in the Synth Rack.
The following are the available commands for track freezing:

 Freeze Track. Bounces the audio in the track to a new audio clip or clips, applies any effects, and disables the FX Rack.
 Unfreeze Track. Discards the bounced audio, restores the original audio to the way it was before the last Freeze or Quick
Freeze command, and enables the FX Rack.

 Quick Unfreeze Track. Hides and mutes the bounced audio, restores the original audio to the way it was before the last Freeze
or Quick Freeze command, and enables the FX Rack. Bounced audio is retained, however, and toggling between Quick Freeze
and Quick Unfreeze should be instantaneous.

 Quick Freeze Track. Only available after a Quick Unfreeze, the Quick Freeze function redisplays and unmutes the bounced
audio instantaneously and disables the FX Rack.
The following are the available commands for synth freezing:

 Freeze Synth. Audio from a soft synth is bounced and placed on the synth’s track. Output from the synth is disabled, as is the
FX Rack on the synth track.

 Unfreeze Synth. Discards bounced audio, enables the synth and track FX Rack. Bounced audio is discarded, and will be rebounced if you choose Freeze again.

 Quick Unfreeze Synth. Hides and mutes the bounced audio, enables the synth and track FX Rack. Bounced audio is retained,
and toggling between Quick Freeze and Quick Unfreeze should be instantaneous.

 Quick Freeze Synth. Only available after a Quick Unfreeze, the Quick Freeze function redisplays and unmutes the bounced
audio instantaneously, disables the synth, and any effects on the synth track.
Note 1: An Unfreeze or Quick Unfreeze command restores the audio on a track to the way it was before the last Freeze or
Quick Freeze command. Any editing you do to a frozen track is discarded when you Unfreeze or Quick Unfreeze the track.

Using real-time effects
You can use plug-in effects non-destructively, in real time (to apply effects offline, see “Applying audio effects” on page 1041), from
the Track view, Track Inspector and Console view. You can also hear your plug-in effects in real time on any live instruments you are
recording—just make sure Input Monitoring is enabled (see “Input monitoring” on page 364). You can also insert effects directly on
clips (see “Effects on clips” on page 1018).
For example, suppose you want to add a reverb effect to an audio track containing a recorded violin solo. You could do it in two
different ways:

 Destructive. The digital audio data itself is modified. Although this may be exactly what you want, it does limit your options. If
you want to modify the effect parameters slightly or to remove the effect and try a different effect, you must use the Undo
command, or revert to a saved copy of the original data.

 Non-destructive (real-time). The digital audio data in your track is not changed but simply altered on the fly during playback.
This means you can experiment with effects parameters, bypass effects, or remove them entirely at any time. Since most effects
require complex numeric calculations, real-time effects processing puts a heavy load on your computer’s CPU. If you use too
many effects, the CPU will not be able to keep up and playback will sound choppy and disconnected.
You can also apply real-time audio effects to a submix in a bus. For example, rather than patching separate reverb effects in each of
several guitar tracks, you can mix the guitar tracks together in a bus and apply a single reverb effect to the submix. This makes much
more efficient use of CPU time. Patching effects on a bus also opens up new creative possibilities.
There are several reasons why you might want to apply effects offline (destructively):

 If you want to apply more effects than your CPU can handle, applying some of the effects offline will reduce CPU usage during
playback.

 If you want to apply effects to an individual audio clip, rather than the whole track, it is simpler to do so using offline effects.
The File > Export > Audio command, allows you to apply real-time effects when you export, so you do not need to apply your
effects destructively or use the Track view Tracks > Bounce to Track(s) command to prepare the tracks beforehand. For
information about exporting audio, see “Exporting audio” on page 1135.
All plug-in effects and soft synths have a Preset window you can use to save and recall your favorite settings for those plug-ins.

Plug-in upsampling on bounce/freeze/export
Some plug-ins that can produce unwanted artifacts when running at lower sample rates. This typically applies to plug-ins and virtual
instruments that don’t oversample internally. Amp sims and synths are affected the most, but so are dynamics processors and some
reverbs.
While you can work around these problems by using higher project sample rates like 88.2 kHz or 96 kHz, doing so can also add CPU
load to the project due to the higher data bandwidth.
Cakewalk provides another solution, which lets you specify whether a VST or DirectX plug-in effect or instrument should be
resampled at 2x the project sample rate when bouncing, rendering, freezing, exporting, etc., or during playback. This allows you to
gain the benefits of running at a higher sample rate in a standard 44.1KHz project. This process happens automatically and behind
the scenes.
To globally enable/disable upsampling for a plug-in, click the FX icon
in the upper left corner of a plug-in window, and select
Upsample on Render or Upsample on Playback on the drop-down menu. These options globally persists for all instances of the
plug-in in all projects, so it only needs to be set once per plug-in.

When selected, Cakewalk will upsample the incoming audio to 2x the project sample rate, process the plug-in at the new rate, and
downsample the resulting output to the project sample rate.
Upsampling provides several benefits:

 Allows plug-ins to process the source material at a higher level of precision.
 Drastically reduces the likelihood of intersample clipping when you maximize the level.
 Undesirable digital artifacts are shifted much further outside the range of human hearing.
 Phase shift is drastically reduced.
 Benefit from 96kHz processing without the hard disk and CPU strain that recording at 96kHz produces.
 Non-linear processors, such as EQ and compressors, benefit from upsampling to lessen aliasing of high frequency components.

Mixing
Using real-time effects

Upsampling settings
The per plug-in upsample settings are stored in the Aud.ini file, under the key [PluginUpsampler] like this:
[PluginUpsampler]
{141AC902-4357-626C-424F-4F5354317E31}.EnableFlags=1
{141AC902-4357-626C-424F-4F5354317E31}.SampleRate=96000
A plug-in is only listed in the Aud.ini file after you have toggled its Upsample on Render or Upsample on Playback option. The
long number string is the plug-in’s CLSID, and is unique for each plug-in.
The {Plug-in CLSID}.EnableFlags= variable specifies whether resampling is applied. It corresponds to the Upsample on
Render and Upsample on Playback settings in Cakewalk’s UI. Valid values are as follows:
 0 = Disables upsampling

 1 = Enables upsampling at render time
 2 = Enables upsampling during playback
 3 = Enables upsampling at render time and during playback
The {Plug-in CLSID}.SampleRate= variable specifies the per plug-in upsampling rate. It defaults to a value of 0 (zero), which
means “resample at twice the project sample rate”. The max sample rate is 384000 Hz. This variable is not stored in the Aud.ini
file by default, so it must be manually added if you want to change a plug-in’s upsample rate (Tip: copy the CLSID from the
corresponding EnableFlags= variable).

To globally bypass plug-in upsampling
To globally enable/disable plug-in upsampling for plug-ins that already have upsampling enabled, click the Enable/Bypass Plug-In
Upsampling button

in the Control Bar’s Mix module. Upsampling is enabled when the button is lit.

Effects parameters
Each effect in an effects patch point has its own independent set of parameter values. For example, you can apply a short reverb in
one track and a long reverb in another track. The dialog boxes for real-time effects contain the same parameters as the offline
effects, though there are a few differences:

 You can adjust the parameters while playback is in progress, so there is no need for an Audition button.
 For audio effects, because mixing is handled through the Track view or Console view, there is no Mixing tab.
 You do not need to click OK for the effect to be applied.
Refer to the sections “MIDI effects (MIDI plug-ins)” on page 907 and “Audio effects (audio plug-ins)” on page 944 for descriptions of
the effects and their parameters.

How to use real-time effects
You can patch effects into tracks and buses in the Track view, Track Inspector and Console view. After you patch one or more effects
into an FX Rack, you can reorder the effects, delete them, or add new ones.

the plug-in UI.

When you place an effect in an FX Rack, an abbreviated name is used to describe the effect. Sometimes the limited space makes it
impossible to identify the effect. If this occurs, simply rest the cursor over the effect for a second or two, and a tooltip will pop up to
display the full name of the effect.
Effects in FX Racks display lines that tell you whether the effect is outputting a mono, stereo, or surround signal:

Figure 441. Plug-ins with ACT focus are highlighted in the FX Rack.

See also:
“Using the per-track EQ” on page 1039.

Look-ahead processing at high latencies
Some plug-ins, such as the Sonitus:fx Multiband and other dynamics processors, use a look-ahead buffer mechanism, which results
in a short delay being introduced to the output signal when the plug-in is used in real-time. Cakewalk’s automatic delay
compensation (ADC) takes care of any delays, but you may experience some anomalies when using such a plug-in to process the
output of a DXi-especially if Cakewalk is configured to use a high mixing latency. The symptoms include audio that appears to drop
out, and/or missed notes (from the MIDI track that is assigned to the DXi). Again, this is more prone to occur with higher latency
settings.
This may happen if Cakewalk doesn't pump ahead enough MIDI data to compensate for ADC. To fix this problem, go to Edit >
Preferences > MIDI - Playback and Recording and increase the Prepare Using [n] Millisecond Buffers value.

 VST factory presets. Any VST factory presets appear below the Most Recently Used section, and are also followed by a
horizontal separator line.

 Cakewalk and user presets. These appear at the bottom of the Presets menu.
The following table tells you how to use presets.
To do this

Do this

Load a preset

Do either of the following:
• Click the drop-down arrow on the right side of the Presets menu, and click the name of the preset in
the drop-down menu.
• Click the left or right side of the Prev/Next button to load the previous or next preset in the menu.
You can click the button repeatedly to step through the menu.

Save the current settings as a preset

If you’re using:
• A VST factory preset. These can not be deleted or overwritten (the Delete button appears
grayed-out). If you want to change one of these, double-click the name, enter a new name, and click
the Save button.
Note: VST presets can be stored by saving a .fxp file (see the following instructions).
• A Cakewalk or user preset. Either save these under a new name: double-click the name, enter a
new name, and click the Save button, or just click the Save button to overwrite the preset with
current values.

Delete a preset

VST factory presets can not be deleted. If you’re not using a VST factory preset, simply display the
preset name in the Presets window, and then click the Delete button.

Load or save a .fxp file

Use the Load Preset or Save Preset commands, respectively, in the VST button drop-down menu

Load or save a .fxb file

Use the Load Bank or Save Bank commands, respectively, in the VST button drop-down menu

The Presets window also has a feature called Preset Dirty Flags. A Preset Dirty Flag is an asterisk that appears next to the name of
the preset. The asterisk tells you that you changed and saved this particular preset in another project, and the settings in the current
project are different from the saved version. If you re-save the preset in the current project with the current settings, the asterisk
disappears, but will reappear in the other project, showing you that the displayed settings in that project are different from the last
saved version of the preset. If you want to get rid of the asterisk in all projects, save the preset in each project with the exact same
settings.

Plug-in property pages have a couple of other controls not related to presets:

 Open View button. This button lets you open a MIDI editing view for a soft synth’s corresponding MIDI track. Click the small
down arrow to specify the default editing view from the menu. The following views are available:

 Step Sequencer (default)
 Piano Roll View
 Staff View
 Event List
 Automation read and write buttons. These buttons enable or disable automation playback and recording for the plug-in’s
parameters. See “Automation” on page 1207 for more information.

 Keystrokes button

. Enabling this button sends all keystrokes to a particular instance of a plug-in when the plug-in’s

property page has focus.

 Pin Plug-In Window

. This button lets you pin individual plug-in windows so they remain open when you open another plugin window. If you prefer to always open a separate window for each plug-in, go to Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings and
clear the Recycle Plug-In Windows check box.
To toggle the current behavior, hold down the CTRL key when you open a plug-in UI:

 If Recycle Plug-In Windows is enabled when you hold down the CTRL key to open a plug-in, all other open plug-in widows
also become pinned.

 If Recycle Plug-In Windows is disabled when you hold down the CTRL key to open a plug-in, all other open plug-in widows
close, and the new plug-in window is unpinned.

Note: Plug-ins that are docked in the MultiDock are not affected by the Recycle Plug-In Windows setting. Docked plug-ins are
automatically pinned and cannot be unpinned. To dock a plug-in window, hold down the CTRL key and drag the window to the
MultiDock.

Note: Plug-in window recycling is disabled when loading projects, which ensures that projects open with all previously open
windows.

To solo track/bus from plug-in window
When tweaking an effect, it is often desirable to only hear the audio that is passing through the effect.
A Solo button
is available on all plug-in property pages, which allows you to quickly solo the track or bus that the effect is
inserted on while adjusting the plug-in. The Solo button functions the exact same way as the Solo button on the source track/bus.
Figure 442. A Solo button is available on each plug-in property page.

Bypassing effects globally
Cakewalk allows you to globally bypass all audio effects in a project. You can also choose to only bypass effects of a specific
category (track, bus or clip).
With global effects bypass, you can:

 Quickly compare (A/B) a dry versus a wet mix.
 Temporarily bypass all inline plug-in delay compensation (PDC) effects in order to avoid delay compensation induced latency
while tracking virtual instruments or input monitored tracks.

 Temporarily reduce CPU consumption.
Cakewalk also has the ability to bypass effects at a per-effect level (effects bypass) as well as at an FX Rack level (rack bypass).
Any existing effects and rack bypass states are preserved when you globally bypass and unbypass effects.
You can selectively unbypass individual effects while in this global bypass state, which makes it easy to quickly audition a single
effect within a mix.
Note: You can only globally bypass audio effects, not MIDI effects.

To globally bypass all effects in a project
In the Control Bar’s Mix module, click the Bypass all Effects button

.

All FX Racks in the active project are temporarily bypassed. To restore the bins to their original state, click the Bypass all Effects
button

again.

Note: The Bypass all Effects option is only a temporary toggle, and is not saved with the project.

Effects on clips
You can insert real-time effects on clips, in both MIDI and audio tracks. Each clip that you insert an effect on displays its own FX
Rack, that you can use to manage the effects on that clip.
The characteristics of clip-based effects are:

 Splitting a clip copies the effect(s) onto both clips.
 You can copy or move clip-based effects from one clip to another, and to or from the FX Rack on a track.
 A clip’s FX Rack also appears in the Clip Properties Inspector.
 Audio effects can be automated by using clip envelopes.
 The Track view Clips > Bounce to Clip(s) command follows clip boundaries—effects tails are cut off, unless you slip-edit the end
of the clip to leave space.

 Freezing a track or synth will also freeze the per-clip FX Racks.
To insert an effect on a clip
Do one of the following:

 Right-click the clip, choose Open Clip FX Rack on the pop-up menu, then right-click the clip FX Rack and choose the desired
effect.

 From the Browser, drag an effect onto the clip.
 Open the Clip Properties Inspector and show the Clip Effects section. Right-click the FX Rack to select an effect, or drag an
effect from the Browser.
The FX icon appears on the clip(s) after you insert the effect.

Canceling changes made to real-time plug-ins
EnablePluginCancelButton=<0 or 1>, default = 0
In Cakewalk 4.0.2 and earlier, opening the property page of a VST plug-in during playback could result in a slight disruption in
playback.
The cause for this problem has its roots in the little Cancel button that sits in the top right corner of the plug-in's property page. The
purpose of this button is to allow the user to cancel out of any changes they might have made to the plug-in, restoring back to
whatever state the plug-in was in before they opened the GUI window. To make this work, Cakewalk would need to take an initial
snapshot of the plug-in's state, and some plug-ins with large amounts of preset data could cause an audio hiccup if the data was
captured for the Cancel button.
To address this issue, Cakewalk 4.0.3 (and later) does not take a snapshot of the plug-in's state by default, and the Cancel button is
not available. There is a new Cakewalk.ini variable to bring back the Cancel button if desired, but be aware that this may also
result in hiccups when opening VST plug-ins during playback.
This variable should be set in the [WinCake] section. For example:
[WinCake]
EnablePluginCancelButton=1

Sidechaining
Cakewalk supports multi-input plug-ins, which are typically sidechain plug-ins that have two inputs: a primary input and a sidechain
input.
When Cakewalk detects such a plug-in in an FX Rack, a virtual output port is created for each extra input exposed by the plug-in.
Audio track, Bus and Send outputs can be routed to sidechain inputs.
Sidechaining is typically used with compressors to limit one signal depending on the signal level of another. Common applications
are to reduce the level of a bass guitar when there is a kick drum, or to reduce the level of music whenever a speaker talks (often
used for background music in radio- and television programs). There are of course many more applications that are not mentioned
here.
Cakewalk includes the following plug-ins that support sidechaining:

 Sonitus Compressor
 Sonitus Gate
In addition, ProChannel supports sidechaining when using the PC4K S-Type Bus Compressor mode. For details, see “ProChannel”
on page 1081.

Limiting the number of plug-in sidechain inputs
By default, a multi-channel VST plug-in always exposes the maximum number of input channels it supports.
You can limit the number of sidechain inputs that Cakewalk displays for any given VST plug-in. This is useful if you don’t need to use
all the input channels and you want to limit the number of audio input channels that are displayed in Cakewalk.

To limit the number of sidechain inputs
1. On the Utilities menu, click Cakewalk Plug-in Manager to open the Cakewalk Plug-in Manager.
2. In the Plug-in Categories list, select VST Audio Effects (VST).
3. In the Registered Plug-ins list, select the desired plug-in.
4. Under VST Configuration, click Plug-in Properties to open the VST Plug-in Properties dialog box.
5. In the Max used inputs box, specify the max number of inputs you want to use for the plug-in.
Note: The default value is the maximum number of mono input channels as exposed by the plug-in. The valid range is from 2
to the maximum number of channels exposed by the plug-in. With a value of 2, Cakewalk will not display any sidechain inputs
for the plug-in. With a value of 4, Cakewalk will display 1 stereo sidechain input, etc.

To assign a track/bus/send output to a sidechain input
1. Insert the sidechain-capable plug-in in a track or bus FX Rack (see “Adding effects” on page 317).
The sidechain input is exposed in the list of available output destinations in all Track/Bus/Send Output controls (except for
outputs that would result in a feedback loop).
2. Assign the desired audio track, bus or Send output to the plug-in’s sidechain input. For more information, see “Assigning Inputs
& Outputs” on page 313.
Note: All sources that are sent to a sidechain input will be mixed down prior to being sent to the sidechain.

Sidechain plug-ins in clip FX Racks and surround bus FX Racks:
Sidechain inputs are not exposed by plug-ins that are inserted in clip FX Racks and surround bus FX Racks. You can insert any
multi-input plug-in into a clip FX Rack or surround bus FX Rack, but the sidechain inputs on these plug-ins will not be active. The
plug-in will function as a normal plug-in and only receive input on its primary input.
See:
“Real-time bounce” on page 1050
“Signal flow” on page 980
“Limiting the number of plug-in sidechain inputs” on page 1020

Bouncing audio with sidechain plug-ins
In order to render a sidechain input as part of a mix when bouncing audio, you must select all tracks that contribute to the sidechain
input.
See:
“Bouncing/freezing with sidechain plug-ins” on page 1051
“Bouncing audio with sidechain plug-ins” on page 1021
“Bouncing tracks” on page 1047

Freeze and sidechain inputs
Freeze does not consider sidechain inputs because Freeze only works on a single audio track at a time. To mix down sidechain
inputs, use standard bounce with all sidechain sources selected in the mix.

External Insert plug-in
The purpose of the External Insert plug-in is to route audio to and from existing I/O ports in Cakewalk, allowing an external audio
device to be effectively patched into any FX Rack. This allows you to seamlessly incorporate your favorite outboard gear in a
Cakewalk project.
The External Insert plug-in is able to measure and automatically compensate for the round-trip delay through your audio hardware
(the time it takes for the audio to exit you computer, be processed by your external audio hardware and finally returned to the
computer).

External Insert interface
The left-hand side contains the hardware/external Send controls and the right-hand side contains the hardware/external Return
controls.
Send Stereo Mode buttons:

 L (Left). This toggle enables/disables the left channel send output (enabled by default).
 R (Right). This toggle enables/disables the right channel send output (enabled by default).
 Mono. This toggle sums the stereo signal to make it dual-mono so the send output has the same audio on the left and right
channels.
Send Level. This is a +/- 24 dB trim to the level that is passed to the external send. This parameter is automatable.
Send VU Meter. This meter shows the signal level being delivered to the external send. Since this is feeding a sound card output,
it is important to avoid clipping at this stage.
Send Port Picker. This control lets you choose an audio output that currently has nothing routed to it. This is the port that you
should connect to the input(s) of your external gear. All output ports that are already used in the project are excluded (except for
master buses that have other instances of the External Insert plug-in routed to them).
Note: Output ports that are used by the External Insert plug-in are excluded from all track and bus Output controls.

Return Phase Control. This control flips the phase of the signal being returned to the external return input. This parameter is
automatable.
Return Level. This is a +/- 24 dB trim to the level that is passed from the external send. This parameter is automatable.
Return VU Meter. This meter shows the signal level entering the external return.
Return Port Picker. This control lets you choose any available hardware input. This is the port you that you should connect to the
output(s) of your external gear. All input ports that are already used in the project are excluded
Note: Input ports that are used by the External Insert plug-in are excluded from all track and bus Input controls.

Delay Measurement. This control shows the last measured round-trip delay through your audio hardware. Click the control to
initiate a new measurement.
Manual Delay Offset.

The center control displays and resets the manual delay offset. The buttons to the left decrease the manual

offset by 1

or 10

samples. All delay buttons

Note 1: Time-based effects such as reverb and delay can artificially increase the latency measurement. Before manually
measuring the delay, you may want to bypass the external gear (if Bypass is supported by your external gear).

Note 2: The delay is automatically re-measured if the Buffer Size setting is changed in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver
Settings or if ports are changed.

To use an external effect in a Cakewalk project
1. Make sure your external gear is connected to your audio interface and turned on.
The external gear’s audio input must be connected to one of your audio interface’s output ports and the external gear’s audio
output must be connected to one of your audio interface’s input ports.
2. Right-click an FX Rack and select Insert External Insert from the pop-up menu.
The External Insert property page appears.
3. Click the Send Port control and choose the audio port that is connected to your external gear’s audio input.
4. Click the Return Port control and choose the audio port that is connected to your external gear’s audio output.
5. Click the Delay Measurement control to measure the round-trip delay through your audio hardware.
The round-trip time for the signal to return is measured and displayed on the button. This is the delay that will be compensated
for in Cakewalk to keep the track in sync with the rest of the project. For information about testing the delay measurement, see
“Testing the delay measurement” on page 1024 and “When to measure the delay” on page 1025.
Note: Time-based effects such as reverb and delay can artificially increase the latency measurement. Before manually
measuring the delay, you may want to bypass the external gear (if Bypass is supported by your external gear).
6. Play back the project and adjust the Send and Return levels to obtain the desired mix. You may also need to adjust levels on
your external gear.
Tip: The Send and Return levels, Phase and I/O port settings can be saved as a preset. If you frequently use a specific external
effect, save the settings as a preset that can be quickly recalled in other projects.

Note: If you bounce audio in a project that uses the External Insert plug-in, the bounce operation must be performed in realtime. For more information, see “Real-time bounce” on page 1050.

Testing the delay measurement
The External Insert plug-in's delay measurement is normally sample accurate. However, for some hardware configurations, it is
possible that a manual adjustment of up to several samples may be required in order to be exactly sample-accurate. If you want to
test the accuracy of the delay measurement for your hardware, follow these steps:
1. Create an audio track and record or import some audio.
2. Use the Track view Tracks > Duplicate Track(s) command to clone the track (including the audio) to a new track.
3. Insert the External Insert plug-in on one of the tracks.
4. Assign the Send and Return to any available input and output on your audio hardware.
5. Patch an audio cable directly between the assigned input and output on your audio hardware.
6. Press Play in Cakewalk.
You should hear both tracks out of time with each other.
7. Carefully match the levels of the two tracks.
Tip: While adjusting levels, refer to the numeric peak indicators on the track strip. It is important for this test that the levels match as
closely as possible.
8. In the Track Inspector or Console view, click the Phase button

on one of the tracks to invert the phase.

9. In the External Insert plug-in, click the Delay Measurement control to measure the round-trip delay through your audio
hardware.
The round-trip time for the signal to return is measured and displayed on the button.
10. Press Play in Cakewalk again.
You should hear the track play significantly quieter and thinner sounding.

1024

Mixing
External Insert plug-in

11. To confirm if the delay is measured as accurately as possible, adjust the manual offset by one sample in either direction. Press
Play after each adjustment and note if the sound gets louder or quieter.
In almost all cases, the sound will be quietest with no manual offset. In some rare circumstances, you may have hardware that
requires an offset of a sample or two. If this is the case, you will want to always add that offset when you use the External Insert plugin.
If your hardware requires a manual offset, you will only need to adjust the offset once for any particular sound card.
Tip: The manual offset can be saved in a preset for the External Insert plug-in.

When to measure the delay
Several things can change the delay of the External Insert, including:

 Changing audio ports.
 Changing audio driver model.
 Changing audio device.
 Changing Cakewalk's buffer size.
When the current delay setting becomes invalid, an asterisk (*) is displayed next to the delay value. If you notice the asterisk, it
means something has changed in your system and it's time to measure the delay again.

Loading a project that uses the External Insert plug-in
When you load a project with the External Insert plug-in (or select a preset in the External Insert interface), Cakewalk checks to see
if the exact same ports are assigned as when the project was saved. Cakewalk’s port assignments can change if you load the
project on a different hardware configuration or change driver models. If there is any discrepancy between the port assignments that
were saved and the ports that are used in the current configuration, the ports are set to “None”. Doing so avoids accidentally loading
projects and having audio routed in an unexpected way.

Bouncing or freezing audio that uses the External Insert plug-in
The External Insert is a simple way to use real outboard effects as if they are inside Cakewalk. However there are several good
reasons why you should consider bouncing or freezing the audio that passes through the External Insert in order to capture the
result of the external hardware processing:

 If the outboard effect's settings are changed between sessions, your project will sound different.
 If you change Cakewalk’s buffer sizes often, you will need to re-measure the delay on all instances of the External Insert each
time.

 If you collaborate with other Cakewalk users, it will be impossible for other users to get the same sound as you unless they have
the exact same outboard gear with exactly the same settings.

 You may want to use that outboard gear for something else - either in an External Insert on another track, or for any other use in
your studio.

 There is no way to use the same piece of outboard gear on different projects with different settings.
If you bounce or freeze audio in a project that uses the External Insert plug-in, the bounce operation must be performed in real-time.
When bouncing audio data, Cakewalk will automatically detect the presence of any External Insert plug-ins (see “External Insert
plug-in” on page 1022) in tracks or buses, and disallow the bounce operation if the Render in Real-time mix option is disabled.
If you need to bounce or freeze audio in a project that contains any External Insert plug-ins, you have two choices:

 Enable Render in Real-time in the Mix and Render section.
 Bypass all active External Insert plug-in's before bouncing.
If you need to make a change later, you can always unfreeze the audio, change settings, then freeze again.

Effects chains
Cakewalk lets you save and load audio effect plug-in chain presets called FX Chain. An FX Chain can be nested within FX Racks,
renamed, moved between tracks, buses and clip FX Racks or saved to disk as FX Chain presets.

Organizing plug-ins
Once you have more than a few plug-in effects and/or soft synths installed on your computer, you might want to organize the way
they appear in the various plug-in and synth menus that you use. The Cakewalk Plug-in Manager is a powerful tool to organize your
plug-in menus. Open the Plug-in Manager by using the Utilities > Cakewalk Plug-in Manager command, and display the Plug-in
Manager’s help file by pressing F1.
By default, plug-ins are sorted by categories such as EQ, Dynamics, Reverb, etc.

VST configuration
Cakewalk automatically scans your VST folders for new plug-ins on startup, registering any unscanned VST plug-ins so that they
become available in Cakewalk’s plug-in menus. You can turn off automatic scanning in Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings by
clearing the Scan For VST Plug-ins On Startup check box.
There are two places you can configure your VST plug-ins manually: go to Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings or use the
Cakewalk Plug-in Manager (Utilities > Cakewalk Plug-in Manager). You can use Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings to set
general VST options, such as choosing which folders to scan, but not specific options on individual plug-ins. Use the Cakewalk Plugin Manager to set options on individual plug-ins (use the Utilities > Cakewalk Plug-in Manager command to open the Plug-in
Manager). The following procedures explain how to use the settings in Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings. The Cakewalk
Plug-in Manager has its own help.

To configure global VST settings
 Go to Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings.
To add a folder to scan
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings.
2. Under VST Scan Paths, click the Add button to open the Browser for Folder dialog box.
3. Choose the folder you want to add, and click OK.
4. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to add any additional folders you might want to scan.
The new folders appear in the VST Scan Paths list, along with any folders that were already in the list.

To remove a folder from the VST Scan Folder(s) list
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings.
2. Under VST Scan Paths, select the folder you want to remove, then click the Remove button.

To set options for all plug-ins in a folder
1. Go to Utilities > Cakewalk Plug-in Manager to open the Cakewalk Plug-in Manager.
2. Under VST Configuration, click the Options button.
3. Select the folder you want to set options for, then click the Folder defaults button.
4. In the dialog box that appears, choose from the following options (options that control properties for individual plug-ins are
grayed-out: use the Cakewalk Plug-in Manager to set those options):

 Enable as plug-in. Enable this option if you want to use the plug-ins in this folder as audio effects.
 Configure as tempo-based effect. If the effects in this folder are supposed to respond to tempo information (for example, a
tempo-synced delay), and they are not responding, make sure this box is checked.

 Force stereo operation. If you need to use mono plug-ins in situations that requires stereo, you can enable this option to
run the plug-ins in stereo mode. This option simply creates two identical output streams from the plug-ins where only one
existed.

 Do not intercept NRPNs. Cakewalk uses NRPNs to run automation of your VST plug-ins. However, some instruments have
their own implementation of this process, so checking this box passes the NRPNs directly to the instrument, allowing it to
manage its own automation.

 Max used inputs.

This option controls the number of sidechain inputs that are exposed by Cakewalk for the plug-in. The
default value is the maximum number of input channels that are exposed by the plug-in. If the value is set to 2, Cakewalk will
not display any sidechainable inputs; if set to 4, Cakewalk will display 1 sidechainable input, etc.

 Load using jBridge wrapper. This check box is only enabled on systems where jBridge is installed. jBridge allows you to
use 32-bit VST effects and instruments when using the x64 version of Cakewalk

 Enable delay compensation.

Usually, you will leave this check box the way you found it. Cakewalk contains a delay
compensator, which turns on and off automatically for each individual plug-in (only a few plug-ins need it). If your plug-in
needs extra time to process the audio data, the plug-in sends a message to Cakewalk, so it can synchronize playback time to
the delayed output from the plug-in.

1036

Mixing
VST configuration

 Serialize Host Access. When Serialize Host Access is selected, communications with the plug-in are serialized as far as
possible. The default behavior is OFF, which allows asynchronous calls to the plug-in.
When Serialize Host Access is disabled, Cakewalk’s audio engine runs more efficiently and allows the UI thread to interact
independently with the plug-in GUI without impacting the audio engine.
The only reason to enable Serialize Host Access would be for a plug-in that has thread safety problems leading to crashes or
glitches when changing plug-in presets.

 Enable mono processing. When enabled, this option replicates the audio signal from the first channel to the left and right
channel, effectively forcing the output of VST to be mono.

 Translate Bank/Program Changes. When enabled, this option translates MIDI program change messages into VST preset
changes. This is only used for plug-ins that do not support MIDI program change messages.

 Always suspend on stop. When enabled the VST plug-in state will be set to suspended when the transport is stopped in
Cakewalk. The default behavior is to keep VSTs always in a resumed state. Enabling this option will prevent effects tails from
being heard when the transport is stopped.

 Always suspend on play. When Always suspend on Play is selected, the plug-in will reset when playback starts. Select
this option for any VST instruments that have problems with stuck notes when stopping the transport. The Always suspend
on Play property is also useful for effects that generate a tail, such as delays and reverbs. The effect is that you will hear the
tails when the transport stops, but not when the transport rolls again. Always Suspend on Play is disabled by default.
5. Click OK to close the dialog box.

To turn Automatic Scanning on or off
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings.
2. Under Scan Options, click the drop-down menu and select Scan On Startup. The next time you launch Cakewalk, your VST
folders will either be scanned or not, depending on the option you chose.

To re-scan failed plug-ins
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings.
2. Under Scan Options, select the Rescan Failed Plug-Ins check box. The next time you scan, any plug-ins that did not scan
correctly during previous scans will be re-scanned.

To re-scan existing plug-ins
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings.
2. Under Scan Options, select the Rescan All Plug-Ins check box. The next time you scan, any plug-ins that have already been
scanned will be re-scanned, and any new folder default options you have chosen will be implemented.

To run a scan
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings.
2. Under Scan Options, click the Scan button.

To set all VST plug-ins to folder defaults
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings.
2. Under Scan Options, click the Reset button. The next time you scan, Cakewalk will set all plug-ins in your VST Scan folders to
your folder default settings.

To set options for individual VST plug-ins
1. On the Utilities menu, click Cakewalk Plug-in Manager to open the Cakewalk Plug-in Manager.
2. In the Plug-in Categories list, select VST Audio Effects or VST Instruments.
3. In the Registered Plug-ins list, select the desired plug-in.
4. Under VST Configuration, click Plug-in Properties to open the VST Plug-In Properties dialog box.
5. Select the desired options, then click OK to close the VST Plug-In Properties dialog box.
Note: For any of the VST properties to take effect, the plug-in must be re-instantiated. The simplest way to do that is to delete
the plug-in from the FX Rack or Synth Rack, then press CTRL+Z to undo.

To enable VST MIDI input and output ports
Some VST audio effects and instruments can generate MIDI events. These plug-ins expose MIDI input and output ports. When
inserting such a VST plug-in, no MIDI ports are exposed by default, and no Synth Rack entry appears in the Browser.
If you wish to utilize MIDI input or output for a supported VST plug-in, you must explicitly enable the ports in Cakewalk. Cakewalk lets
you enable MIDI input and output ports for any MIDI capable VST plug-in.
1. Double-click the VST plug-in in an FX Rack to open the plug-in’s property page.
2. Click the VST Preset Options drop-down menu and select one of the following options:

 Enable MIDI Input. When enabled, the VST plug-in shows up as an available MIDI output destination in the project.
 Enable MIDI Output. When enabled, the VST plug-in shows up in the Browser’s Synth Rack, and the corresponding ports
are exposed to Cakewalk.
Note: If you enable a MIDI output port, a corresponding MIDI input port is also enabled. However, you can enable a MIDI input
independent of the output.

The Enable MIDI Input and Enable MIDI Output menu commands are unavailable if the VST plug-in doesn't support MIDI input or
output.
For more information about adjusting VST plug-in settings, see the Cakewalk Plug-in Manager online Help.

Using the per-track EQ
Cakewalk has a multiband EQ patched into each audio track by default. You can adjust these EQ’s in the Console view and the
Track Inspector. You can show or hide the EQ plot, and open the EQ interface to access all EQ controls.
The EQ lives in the ProChannel (for details, see “ProChannel” on page 1081).
The ProChannel module lets you adjust the per-track equalization curve.

Applying audio effects
You can destructively apply audio effects for one or more tracks. When you are pleased with the audio effects you have patched into
a track, you can apply the effects to the track. Applying effects to a track saves resources, allowing you to include additional tracks
and/or effects
Note: When applied effects are undone, they are not re-patched in the FX Rack(s).

To apply multiple audio effects offline
1. Add one or more audio effects to one or more tracks in either the Track view, Track Inspector or the Console view.
2. In the Track view, select the tracks or clips you want to be affected.
3. Select Process > Apply Effect > Audio Effects.
The Apply Audio Effects dialog box appears.
4. If desired, select the option to delete the effects after applying them.
5. Click OK.
If you do not delete the effects after applying them, they remain active.

CPU usage of audio effects
The number of real-time audio effects that your computer can handle depends on the number of audio tracks in your project, the
number and type of effects you want to use, and the type and speed of your CPU. Certain effects are more CPU-intensive than
others, and enabling certain settings (such as using equalization within the Stereo Reverb) increases CPU usage for those effects.

Applying MIDI effects
You can destructively apply the MIDI effects in a track’s patch point. This makes it easy for you to experiment with MIDI effects
before you commit to them on a more permanent basis.

To apply MIDI effects destructively
1. In the Track view, select the tracks or clips to be affected.
2. Select Process > Apply Effect > MIDI Effects.
3. If desired, select the option to delete the effects after applying them.
4. Click OK.
If you don’t delete effects after applying them, they continue to be active during playback, even though they have already been
applied.

Using control groups
Cakewalk lets you link faders, knobs, or buttons in the Track view, Track Inspector and Console view into groups. Groups are
collections of controls whose movements are linked together. For example:

 Two Volume faders or controls can be grouped so that when you increase or decrease the volume of one track, the volume of the
other track changes in exactly the same way.

 Four Mute buttons can be grouped so that when you click on the Mute button to mute track 1, tracks 1 and 2 are muted and
tracks 3 and 4 are un-muted.
The Console view and Track view identify controls, knobs and faders that are grouped using a colored group indicator that is
displayed on the controls in each group. The controls in group A are displayed with a red indicator, the controls in group B with a
green indicator, and so on. Controls, faders and knobs can be grouped together.
When you group buttons together, the way they work is based on their position when you create the group:

 Buttons that are in the same position when grouped will turn on and off together at all times.
 Buttons that are in opposite positions when grouped will always remain in opposite positions.
When you group buttons with knobs or faders, the button turns on/off when the knob or fader reaches its halfway point.
You have several additional options. There are three general types of groups: absolute, relative, and custom. Here’s how they work.

Absolute
The range of motion in all controls in the group is identical. When you move one control in the group, all other controls in the group
move the same amount in the same direction. The controls do not necessarily need to start at the same level.

Relative
The range of motion for controls in the group is not the same. All controls in the group have the same value at one point—the lowest
level for send, return, and volume levels, and zero for pan controls.

Custom
Sometimes you want to define a more complex relationship between the controls in a group. For example:

 You want two controls to operate in reverse—when one fader drops, the other increases (cross fade).
 You want two volume faders grouped so that they are locked together at maximum level, but drop at different rates.
 You want two faders to be locked together with the same range of motion, but a third fader grouped with them to have a different
range of motion.
Custom groups let you set the range of motion for each control in the group by entering a starting and ending value. As any one
control in the group is moved from its starting position to its ending position, the other controls in the group exercise their full range of
motion.
When you have defined a custom group, you can adjust the starting and ending position of each control using the Group Settings
dialog box or using pop-up menus on the controls in the group.
Note: By default, the relative gain between grouped controls that affect gain is preserved. If you prefer the relative position of
the controls to be preserved regardless of the relative gain, there is a check box in the Group Properties dialog box that will
toggle between these two behaviors.

To add a control to a group
1. Right-click on the control.
2. Choose a group from the Group submenu.
Cakewalk adds the control to the group. Controls, knobs and faders are highlighted with the group’s color indicator.
Tip: You can quickly group identical controls in multiple tracks. To do so, select the desired tracks, then assign a control to a group.
Cakewalk automatically assigns the same control in all other selected tracks to the same group.

1042

Mixing
Using control groups

To remove a control from its group
1. Right-click on the control.
2. Choose Remove From Group from the menu.
Cakewalk removes the control from the group and displays the control with the neutral color indicator.

To remove all controls from a group
 Right-click a control in the group, and choose Clear Group from the pop-up menu.
To override a control’s grouping
 Hold down the CTRL key while moving the control.
The control remains part of the group and functions as such once the CTRL key is lifted.

To set the group type to Relative or Absolute
1. Right-click on any control in the group and choose Group Manager to display the Group Manager dialog box.
Figure 458. The Group Manager dialog box.

2. Choose Absolute or Relative as the group type and click OK.
Cakewalk uses the type to determine the range of motion for the group’s controls.

To create a custom group
1. Right-click on any control in the group and choose Group Manager to display the Group Manager dialog box.
2. Choose Custom as the group type. The starting and ending values for each control are displayed.
3. To change the starting or ending value for a control, click on the control in the list and enter new values in the Start and End box.
4. To swap the starting and ending value, click the Swap button.
5. Click Close when you are done.
Cakewalk uses the type to determine the range of motion for the group’s controls.

To adjust the Start Value of a control
1. Set the control to the desired starting value.
2. Right-click on the control.
3. Choose Value > Set Start = Current.
Cakewalk sets the start value of the control.
The Set Start = Current and Set End = Current commands set the range of motion that a grouped control moves through as the
other members of the group move through their starting and ending values. You don’t have to designate a group as a custom group
to create a custom group—just group some controls and set their starting and ending values.

Quick Groups
Quick Groups allow you to effortlessly adjust identical controls across multiple tracks or buses. A Quick Group can either affect all
tracks, or only selected tracks of the same type. You hold down the CTRL key to momentarily create a Quick Group.
The following rules apply when using Quick Groups:

 Quick Groups only affect tracks of the same type (Audio or MIDI).
 For instrument tracks, the relevant controls is treated as belonging to an Audio or MIDI track.
 Quick Groups do not work between tracks and buses.
 Quick Groups apply a relative adjustment to each control.
 If you adjust a control in a selected track, only selected tracks of the same type are affected.
 If you adjust a control in a non-selected track, all tracks are affected.
To use a Quick Group
Do one of the following:

 To adjust the same control in all tracks. Hold down the CTRL key and adjust a control in a track that is not selected.
Cakewalk automatically adjusts the same control in all other tracks.

 To adjust the same control in selected tracks. Select the tracks you want to adjust, then hold down the CTRL key and adjust
a control in any selected track. Cakewalk automatically adjusts the same control in all other selected tracks of the same type.
When you adjust controls in a Quick Group, each affected control displays a temporary group color.

Using remote control
This section explains how to assign knobs or sliders on a MIDI controller to control specific parameters on specific tracks. If you have
a control surface with groups of faders such as a Tascam US-428 or CM Labs MotorMix, see “External devices” on page 1385.
Cakewalk‘s Remote Control function lets you use a MIDI device to remotely control knobs, buttons, and sliders in the Track and
Console views. For example, you can:

 Use a key on your keyboard to temporarily mute a track
 Work the send level in a bus with your pitch bend wheel
 Set the main volume levels with NRPN messages
 Prevent Cakewalk from sending any controller messages to your MIDI device.
 Record automation from an external controller
If you set up remote control for a grouped control, the remote control works all controls in the group.
The type of MIDI message used to work a control is selected in the Remote Control dialog box. The options are as follows:
Message option

Message effect on buttons

a mono track, a stereo track or several mono tracks that contain the mixture of the original tracks, preserving the volume, pan, and
effects for each track. If you’re bouncing tracks that are routed to a surround bus, you can bounce them to as many mono tracks as
you have surround channels, by choosing the Split Mono option in the Channel Format field of the Bounce to Tracks dialog box,
and also choosing a surround bus in the Source Category field. After their creation, the submix tracks are just like any other
tracks—you can edit them, add effects, copy them to another project, etc. The original, unmixed audio tracks are not deleted, so you
can archive them and recover them later, or continue using them as before.
Note: You control the bit depth of all rendering operations (bouncing, freezing, applying effects) in Edit > Preferences > File Audio Data, in the Render Bit Depth field. The default value of 32 is the best for most situations. See “Bit depths for rendering
audio” on page 1361 for more information.
The Track view Tracks > Bounce to Track(s) command operates completely offline, meaning you can mix down tracks that may be
too complex for your machine to actually play in real time.
Here are some reasons to use Bounce to Track(s):

 Your mix is so complex that real-time playback is impossible. Bounce to Track(s) produces the correct mix, and store the result
in a new track or tracks.

 You require more CPU time for your real-time effects. With Bounce to Track(s) , you can premix some of your tracks with realtime effects applied, saving CPU time during playback.
If you mix down to tracks that already have data, the new events are placed in the track, but do not overwrite existing material.

To mix down (bounce) audio tracks
1. Set all volume, pan, effects, and automation settings just as you want them.
2. Select the tracks or clips you want to mix down.
3. If you are using effects on the tracks and want to mix the effects down at this time, select the whole length of the longest track or
clip plus an extra measure for the reverb or effects “tail.”
4. Click the Track view Tracks menu and choose Bounce to Track(s) to open the Bounce to Track(s) dialog box.

5. Select the first destination track for the mixdown.
6. If you’ve saved a preset configuration for the Bounce to Tracks(s) dialog box, select it now in the Preset window.
7. In the Source Category field, select the source you want to use for your bounced track(s) from the following options:

 Tracks. Choosing this option creates new separate tracks for each track you highlight in the Sources field. Each track you
highlight will produce a new mono track, stereo track, or two new mono tracks (the Split Mono option), depending on what
you choose in the Channel Format field.

 Buses. Choosing this option creates new separate tracks for each bus you highlight in the Sources field. Each bus you
highlight will produce a new mono track, stereo track, or two to eight new mono tracks (the Split Mono option), depending on
whether the bus is a stereo or surround bus, and depending on what you choose in the Channel Format field.

 Hardware Outputs. Choosing this option creates new separate tracks for each hardware output you highlight in the
Sources field. Each hardware output you highlight will produce a new mono track, stereo track, or two to eight new mono
tracks (the Split Mono option), depending on whether the output is a stereo output or the Surround Main, and depending on
what you choose in the Channel Format field.

 Entire Mix. Choosing this option bounces your entire mix down to a new mono track, stereo track, or two to eight new mono
tracks (the Split Mono option), depending on whether the output is a stereo output or the Surround Main, and depending on
what you choose in the Channel Format field.
8. Select a channel format: the kind of track(s) you want to create with your bounce.
9. Select source buses or tracks.

10. Select the kind of dithering you want for your bounce, or select None.

 In the Mix and Render section, choose the elements you want to include in the mixdown. If you want to exclude muted tracks
and/or include only soloed tracks, make sure Track Mute/Solo is checked. Disable Render in Real-time, otherwise the bounce
process will take as long as it takes to play your selected track data in real time. Usually, you also want to check 64-bit Mix
Engine. This option lets you turn on the 64-bit mix engine temporarily while you bounce your tracks. This produces a higherquality bounce without taxing your CPU during the rest of your session.
Note 1: If you have patched a synth into a track or bus, make sure you check Track FX to include synths that are patched into
tracks, and check Bus FX to include synths that are patched into buses.

Note 2: If you don’t check Track Automation, any initial volume and pan settings in an exported track are ignored and the
track’s audio data will be exported at the level that exists in the track, with pan set to center. If you don’t check Clip Automation,
any trim settings are ignored during export.
11. If you want to save your settings as a preset, type a name for them in the Preset box, then press ENTER.
12. Click OK.
Cakewalk mixes the audio data and a new track or tracks appear in your project.

Real-time bounce
When Render in Real-Time is disabled
When Render in Real-time is disabled, the bounce operation is performed by streaming audio as fast as possible through all mixers
and buses in the project. During a fast bounce operation, all hardware outputs are temporarily disabled and the bounce is performed
silently.
Note: There is no sonic degradation by performing a non real-time bounce since it uses the same operation that is performed
during normal playback.
There are a few limitations with performing a fast bounce operation:

 You cannot perform a fast bounce if the audio contains any External Insert plug-ins. Since the External Insert plug-in is typically
used to receive audio from external hardware, Cakewalk’s audio output must be sent to the external hardware in real-time.
Cakewalk will display an error message if you attempt to bounce audio that is routed to the External Insert plug-in.

 Certain software instruments, such as samplers, cannot process audio faster than real-time and will produce glitches when
operated in fast bounce mode.

 Some hardware-based DSP effects have trouble with fast bounce.
When Render in Real-time is enabled
When Render in Real-time is enabled, the bounce is performed in real-time by actually playing back the project audibly in similar
fashion to standard playback. In real-time bounce mode, all audio hardware inputs and outputs are active in order to allow I/O to
external hardware inserts.
If you manually stop playback during the bounce operation, Cakewalk will prompt you if you want to keep or cancel the bounce.

Audible bounce
When Render in Real-time is enabled, the real-time bounce operation can be performed either silently or audibly.
The following dialogs have a new Audible Bounce option:

 “Bounce to Track(s) dialog” on page 1596
 “Export Audio dialog” on page 1614
 Export Video mix options
 “Apply Audio Effects dialog” on page 1589
 “Freeze Options dialog” on page 1631
When Audible Bounce is unchecked, no audio output will be heard during the bounce process. When Render in Real-time and
Audible Bounce are both enabled, you can hear the output of the mixdown.
Caution: Depending on the gainstages used in the project and the mixdown options selected–such as bouncing with Source
Category assigned to Tracks, or with mute/solo or automation disabled under Mix and Render, –the output may be louder or
softer than during normal playback. Please be sure to turn down the master output level before using real-time audible bounce
under these scenarios to avoid the possibility of speaker damage.

Real-time bounce

To allow live input during bounce
1. Click the Track view Tracks menu and choose Bounce to Track(s) to open the Bounce to Track(s) dialog box.
2. Under Mix and Render, select Render in Real-time and select the Live Input check box.

Improve real-time bounce performance
When performing a real-time bounce operation, you can use the Pause button as a toggle to temporarily reduce the frequency of
GUI updates. This maximizes CPU resources for the audio engine and can be useful while playing projects that consume a lot of
CPU, to help avoid dropouts.
For more information, see “The Now time is not smooth during playback or scrolls out of view” on page 1439.

Bouncing/freezing with sidechain plug-ins
Sidechain inputs are not automatically included when you bounce a selection. If you want to bounce the output of a single track that
contains a sidechain plug-in, the easiest solution is to also select all tracks that contribute to the plug-in’s sidechain input, and do a
bounce with Render in Real-time enabled and the Source Category set to Tracks.
Note: Freezing a track with sidechain inputs will not include the sidechain input. If you need to free up CPU on a track that
includes a sidechain, use the bounce command with all sidechain sources explicitly selected in the mix.

Mix Recall
Mix Recall allows you to save and recall multiple mixes for the same project, without having to save multiple copies of the project file.
A mix can be saved as a Mix Scene within the project, and each project can store multiple Mix Scenes. A Mix Scene contains all
track, bus, hardware output, ProChannel and plug-in static and automation mix settings.
With Mix Recall, you can:

 Freely experiment with different mix ideas without affecting previous mixes. Be confident that you can return to an earlier mix at
any time.

 Easily compare different mixes. There is even a command to toggle between the two most recently-used Mix Scenes. For details,
see “To recall the previous Mix Scene” on page 1057.

 Create alternative mixes for specific purposes, such as album version, radio edit, a capella, instrumental, temporary headphone
mix while recording, etc. Audio and MIDI data in the project is unaffected by Mix Scenes, so edits to audio and MIDI data are
preserved across all Mix Scenes.

 Restore a project to a prior mix or a subset of tracks/buses, leaving other tracks unaffected. For details, see “To only recall
selected tracks or buses” on page 1060

 Quickly reset the entire project or a subset of tracks/buses to a default flat mix. For details, see “To reset all mix parameters to
their default settings” on page 1060.

 Export all mixes in a single operation. For details, see “To export multiple mixes” on page 1061.

A. Save Scene B. Save As New Scene C. Recall Previous Scene D. Mix Recall menu

The Mix Recall module contains the following controls:

 Mix Recall menu. The Mix Recall menu lets you create, load, save, rename and delete Mix Scenes. The name of the current
Mix Scene is shown in the menu. The menu contains the following commands:

 List of Mix Scenes. List of saved Mix Scenes. Select a Mix Scene to load its mix. If the project contains more than 10 Mix
Scenes, the list is shown in a Recall Scene submenu.

 Recall Previous Scene. Load the previous Mix Scene. This allows you to quickly compare two different mixes by toggling
between the two most recent Mix Scenes. The name of the previous Mix Scene is shown in parenthesis.

 Reset Mix. Reset all mix parameters to their default values and clear any automation envelopes. This command only
applies to the settings that are selected in the Mix Recall Settings dialog box (see “To configure Mix Recall settings” on page
1059 and “Mix Recall Settings dialog” on page 1774).

 Save Scene. Save the current mix to the selected Mix Scene. If no Mix Scene is selected, a new Mix Scene (and .cwm file)
is created.

 Save As New Scene. Save the current mix to a new Mix Scene.
 Rename Scene. Rename the selected Mix Scene. Note: this command only creates a friendly name for the current project;
it does not rename the actual .cwm (Cakewalk Mix Scene) file that is stored on your computer’s hard disk since the Mix Scene
might also be used by other projects.

 Delete Scene. Delete the selected Mix Scene. Note: this command only removes the project’s reference to the Mix Scene, it
does not delete the underlying .cwm file from your computer’s hard disk since the Mix Scene might still be used by other
projects.

 Delete All Scenes. Delete all listed Mix Scenes for the project. Note: this command only removes the project’s reference to
the Mix Scenes, it does not delete the underlying .cwm files from your computer’s hard disk since the Mix Scenes might also
be used by other projects.

 Mix Recall Settings. Open the Mix Recall Settings dialog box, which lets you specify the type of data that is applied when
you load a Mix Scene or use the Recall Previous Scene and Reset Mix commands. You can choose to restore all the mix
data (default) or just a subset of the data. You can also specify if the operation should apply to all tracks and buses, or only to
selected tracks or buses. For details, see “To configure Mix Recall settings” on page 1059.

 Save Scene

. Save the current mix to the selected Mix Scene. If no Mix Scene is selected, a new Mix Scene (and .cwm file)

is created.

 Save As New Scene

.

Save the current mix to a new Mix Scene.

 Recall Previous Scene

. Load the previous Mix Scene. This allows you to quickly compare two different mixes. Right click
the Recall Previous Scene button to open the Mix Recall Settings dialog box.

1055

To create a new Mix Scene
1. To create a new Mix Scene based on the project’s current mix state, do one of the following:

 In the Control Bar’s Mix Recall module, click the Save As New Scene button

.

 In the Control Bar’s Mix Recall module, click the Mix Recall drop-down menu, then click Save As New Scene.
2. Type a descriptive name for the Mix Scene, or accept the default name.

Note: A saved project file stores references to all Mix Scenes used by that project, as shown in the Control Bar’s Mix Recall
module. The physical Mix Scene files are stored externally in the \MixScenes folder, alongside the project audio folder. The
file naming convention is <project name>.Mix n.cwm. Because Mix Scenes that are used by a project are always listed in
the Control Bar’s Mix Recall module, you do not need to manually manage any external files.
Bundle files (.cwb files) additionally embed all the physical Mix Scene files (.cwm) within the bundle. This allows you to easily load a
bundle file along with its embedded Mix Scenes on a different computer.

To save a Mix Scene
To save the project’s current mix state to the current Mix Scene, do one of the following:

 In the Control Bar’s Mix Recall module, click the Save Scene button

.

 In the Control Bar’s Mix Recall module, click the Mix Recall drop-down menu, then click Save Scene.
Tip: You can auto-save the current Mix Scene when you load another Mix Scene. To do so, enable the Auto-save when switching
scenes option in the Mix Recall Settings dialog box. For details, see “To configure Mix Recall settings” on page 1059.

To recall a Mix Scene

Warning: Recalling a Mix Scene clears the Undo History (see “Undo, redo, and the undo history” on page 553), and is not
undoable.

1056

Mixing
Mix Recall

In the Control Bar’s Mix Recall module, click the Mix Recall drop-down menu, then select the desired Mix Scene.

Note 1: When loading a Mix Scene, the imported settings are determined by the settings in the Mix Recall Settings dialog box.
For details, see “To configure Mix Recall settings” on page 1059.

Note 2: Mix Recall uses internal track IDs to map mix parameters. Mix Scenes only apply to “same” tracks and buses in the
project. That is, to tracks and buses that existed when you last saved the Mix Scene.
If you delete tracks or create new tracks, then load an old Mix Scene, the Mix Scene will not automatically map the affected tracks.
Any new tracks or buses are ignored. In this case you must resave the Mix Scene or create a new Mix Scene in order to include the
new tracks/buses.

To recall the previous Mix Scene
Do one of the following:

 In the Control Bar’s Mix Recall module, click the Recall Previous Scene button

.

 In the Control Bar’s Mix Recall module, click the Mix Recall drop-down menu, then click Recall Previous Scene.

Note 1: When loading a Mix Scene, the imported settings are determined by the settings in the Mix Recall Settings dialog box.
For details, see “To configure Mix Recall settings” on page 1059.

Note 2: If you switch Mix Scenes during playback, a small glitch may occur if the Mix Scenes use plug-ins. This is normal and
happens because the plug-ins have to be loaded/unloaded. To make Mix Recall process faster, you can turn off FX recall in the
Mix Recall Settings dialog box. For details, see “To configure Mix Recall settings” on page 1059.

To combine/merge mixes from multiple Mix Scenes
You might have multiple Mix Scenes and you want to combine the best parts from each Mix Scene. For example, you might want to
use the drum mix from one Mix Scene, and the vocal mix from a different Mix Scene. Mix Recall makes this very easy.
1. Do one of the following:

 In the Control Bar’s Mix Recall module, click the Mix Recall drop-down menu, then click Mix Recall Settings.
 In the Control Bar’s Mix Recall module, right click the Recall Previous Scene button

.

2. In the Mix Recall Settings dialog box, click the Advanced button to show advanced settings, then select the following options:

 Apply to: Track/bus selection
 Track controls
 Track automation
 Track FX
Note: Also select any other mix settings you want to recall.

3. Click OK to close the Mix Recall Settings dialog box.
4. Select the track(s) that contain the mix you want to replace by a specific Mix Scene. For example, select all the drum tracks.
5. In the Control Bar’s Mix Recall module, click the Mix Recall drop-down menu, then select the desired Mix Scene. For example,
the Mix Scene that contains the desired drum mix.
6. Select the next track(s) that you want to import a Mix Scene to. For example, select all the vocal tracks.
7. In the Control Bar’s Mix Recall module, click the Mix Recall drop-down menu, then select the desired Mix Scene. For example,
the Mix Scene that contains the desired vocal mix.
8. Repeat steps 6-7 for any tracks you want to update.
You have now combined mixes from different Mix Scenes, while all unselected tracks remain unchanged.

To rename a Mix Scene
1. Load the Mix Scene you want to rename.
2. In the Control Bar’s Mix Recall module, click the Mix Recall drop-down menu, then click Rename Scene.
3. Type a descriptive name for the Mix Scene.
Note: Mix Scenes are saved in the \MixScenes folder, alongside the project audio folder. Renaming a Mix Scene only
changes the friendly name for the current project, it does not rename the actual .cwm file that is stored on your computer’s hard
disk. This is intentional because other projects might reference the same Mix Scene.

Surround Mixing

Cakewalk fully supports surround mixing. Cakewalk can create finished surround mixes in all popular surround formats, including
Windows Media 9 Pro. You can use a joystick to control surround panning if you want.
Note: It’s always advisable to know the required sampling rate and audio driver bit depth for the target medium that your
surround project will be used in. That way you can work in the correct format from the start, without having to convert later. You
can set these parameters in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings.
To get a complete understanding of Cakewalk’s surround functions, start with the “Surround basics” on page 1063.
See:
“Surround basics” on page 1063
“Configuring Cakewalk for surround mixing” on page 1064
“Panning in surround” on page 1069

“Surround effects” on page 1076
“Importing surround mixes” on page 1079
“Exporting surround mixes” on page 1160

Surround basics
Surround sound is a common name for various techniques for positioning audio in reference to the listener. Whereas regular stereo
is limited to left/right positioning, within a relatively narrow field, surround sound opens possibilities of positioning an audio source
anywhere around the listener. Surround sound comes in many formats. The differences between the formats are in three areas:

 The number of speakers. This varies from 3.2 all the way to 8.1.
 The angles of the speakers.
 The intended final coding format. This depends on the media the audio will be “stored” on: film, broadcast video or DVD, for
example.
The most common format is 5.1, which consists of five full-range channels and a low-frequency effects (LFE) channel (the “.1” in 5.1
is the LFE or sub channel). The five full-range channels are reproduced by left, right, and center speakers positioned in front of the
listener (L, R, and C for short), and left and right surround speakers positioned behind the listener (Ls and Rs for short). The LFE
channel can be routed to the main speakers or to a subwoofer that can be positioned almost anywhere.
The center channel is typically used to lock dialog box or sounds to a video screen. The LFE channel is generally routed to a
subwoofer to enhance low audio frequencies for effects such as explosions or crashes. Audio in this channel is limited to a range of
approximately 25 Hz to 120 Hz.

Configuring Cakewalk for surround mixing
This section covers setting up Cakewalk for surround sound.
See:
“Using surround format templates” on page 1064
“Choosing a surround format” on page 1066
“Surround buses” on page 1067
“Routing in surround” on page 1067
“Downmixing” on page 1068

Using surround format templates
A Surround Format template specifies the number of speakers and the order in which the speakers are arranged.
There are several different surround formats, including LCRS, 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1, with 5.1 being most common. The number after the
decimal point refers to the number of Low Frequency Effect (LFE) speakers. However, there are even different flavors of 5.1. The
different flavors specify in which order the speakers are arranged, and the speaker angles. For example:

Surround Format

Configuring Cakewalk for surround mixing

To mix in surround sound in Cakewalk, you must insert at least one surround bus.
A project can include multiple surround buses, but all surround buses in a project use the same surround format (5.1, 7.1, etc.).
The project’s surround format is based on one of the following Surround Format templates:

 2.0
 2.1
 LCR
 LRC+LFE
 LRS
 LFS+LFE

Configuring Cakewalk for surround mixing

1065

The Surround Format templates are hard-coded, and cannot be deleted. However, you can freely assign any enabled audio output
port to any surround channel, and save the configuration as a preset.
Surround settings are per project. Surround speaker assignments default to unique audio output channels when you choose a new
template.
To configure surround settings, go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Surround.
See:
“Choosing a surround format” on page 1066

Choosing a surround format
Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Surround to select a surround format. Choosing a surround format sets the number of
speakers your project is using, and lets you choose a specific sound card output for each speaker. Here you can also choose
parameters for bass management, and for downmixing, which means converting a surround mix into a stereo mix.
The group of sound card outputs that you choose in Edit > Preferences > Project - Surround make up the “Surround Main.” The
Surround Main becomes a choice on the Outputs menus of tracks and buses as soon as you insert a surround bus into your
project. You won’t see a “Surround Main” output module in the output modules section of the Console view, because it’s just a term
for the group of sound card outputs you choose for surround mixing. The pan control on any track or bus that outputs to the
“Surround Main” controls which hardware outputs receive the signal that the track or bus sends to the “Surround Main.”
Cakewalk saves the surround settings you choose in Edit > Preferences > Project - Surround with your project, including your
downmixing parameters. If you have some particular settings you might use again, you can save a group of settings as a preset
(except for downmixing parameters—you can change these, but they aren’t saved in presets). To save a group of settings as a
preset, type a name in the Presets field and then click the Disk icon that’s to the right of the field. When you want to use this preset
in a project, just choose it from the Presets drop-down menu.

To choose a surround format and set sound card outputs
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Surround.
2. Select a format from the Surround Format drop-down.
The diagram to the right of the Surround Format menu changes to illustrate the speaker placement of the format that you
chose.
3. In the Output column, assign each channel to a sound card output.
Note: Consumer-grade sound cards, such as Audigy or SoundBlaster, typically reserve output 4 for the LFE channel. Check
your sound card manual for details.
4. Click OK.
Note: Take a moment to make sure your speakers are correctly hooked up to the corresponding outputs before you attempt
any playback. See the diagram in Edit > Preferences > Project - Surround for the speaker setup. If you are not sure what the
abbreviations for the speaker names are, see “Surround basics” on page 1063.

Surround Mixing
Configuring Cakewalk for surround mixing

Surround buses
You have to have at least one surround bus in your project to use surround sound. A surround bus differs from a stereo bus in that it
simply has more channels. For example, if a project is set to 7.1, then the bus has 8 channels: 7 directional channels and one LFE
channel.

To insert a surround bus
1. In the Bus Pane of the Track view or the Console view, right-click to display a pop-up menu of bus options.
2. Select Insert Surround Bus from the pop-up menu.
Or

 Use the Insert > Surround Bus menu command.
See:
“Routing in surround” on page 1067

Routing in surround
Tracks can send output to a surround bus, the Surround Main, or a hardware output. If a track is routed to a surround bus or the
Surround Main, it has surround meters and a surround panner. You can route any track or bus to another bus, the Surround Main or
a hardware out. However, you are prevented from creating a signal loop by routing the signal back into a bus that is already in the
signal flow. The following table lists how each of these routing options affects the signal.

Signal Flow

Result

Track to stereo bus

No change

Mono track to surround bus

Mono signal is routed to both Left and Right channels of surround format. You can
change the routing to other surround channels by using the surround panner on the
track.

Stereo track to surround bus

Stereo left channel is routed to Left channel of surround format; stereo right channel is
routed to Right channel of surround format. You can change the routing to other
surround channels by using the surround panner on the track.

Downmixing
Downmixing is a way of previewing your surround project in stereo only. There are various cases where surround is not available
and it may be that someone plays your project in stereo only. A radio broadcast is a good example. Downmixing is a valuable tool for
determining if your project will sound good in stereo. However, you can export your project in stereo, and Cakewalk uses your
downmix settings to create your exported file.
The following table lists the downmixing settings in Edit > Preferences > Project - Surround and gives a brief description of what
the setting does. You can also manually enter other values besides these preset ones.
Downmixing Setting

Options

Center Downmix Level (dB)

These options determine how much of the center is mixed to the left and right.
• -3 dB. Maintains the same level of center channel sound when you listen in a typically reverberant
room.
• -4.5 dB. A compromise level between -3 dB and -6 dB.
• -6 dB. Maintains the same level of center channel sound when you listen to direct sound without typical
room reverberations.
• -INF. Eliminates all of the Center channel signal.

Surround Downmix Level (dB)

The amount of Left Surround and Right Surround mixed into the Left and Right channels respectively.
• -3 dB. Maintains the same level of surround.
• -6 dB. Reduces the level of surround so that it doesn’t compete with center channel sound such as
dialog.
• -INF. Eliminates all of the Surround channel signal.

LFE Level (dB)

The amount of the LFE channel mixed into the Left and Right channels respectively.
• -12 (or type in a value). Lets you choose the level of LFE in the stereo mix.
• -INF. Eliminates all LFE.

To downmix a project
1. If you do not have a stereo bus in your project, create one by right-clicking in the Bus pane in the Track view or Console view and
selecting Insert Stereo Bus from the menu that appears.
2. Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Surround, select a center downmix level and a surround downmix level, and click OK.
3. In each of the surround buses, assign the output to a stereo bus.
4. Listen to your project through the stereo bus, and make any final adjustments to the stereo mix by changing the values in Edit >
Preferences > Project - Surround.
5. If you want to export your stereo mix, use the File > Export > Audio command. This command obeys your downmix settings.

Configuring Cakewalk for surround mixing

Panning in surround
Unlike stereo panning which sends sound to left and right speakers, surround panning means sending sound to multiple speakers at
points along a circle.
When a track/bus/send is assigned to a surround bus, the Pan control turns into a multi-dimensional surround panner. The surround
panner comes in four sizes:

 Micro. This is found in the Track view.
 Small. This is found on sends.
 Medium. This is the surround panner which is displayed in the Track Inspector and Console view.
 Large. This is a large surround panner (see “Controlling surround panning” on page 1070 for a picture) which has additional
controls, and appears when you right-click a surround panner and choose Open Surround Panner from the pop-up menu, or
double-click outside the surround panner circle, or press ENTER when the panner has focus.

A. Medium surround panner in Console view

The small and large panners are always synchronized; the large panner simply provides increased resolution when you adjust the
surround pan position.
Note 1: Surround panning is not available for tracks/sends that are routed to non-surround buses.

Note 2: If the track/bus/send is reassigned to a stereo bus, any surround automation will be orphaned, but will automatically
reconnect if the track/bus/send is later assigned back to a surround bus.

A. Angle and focus marker B. Width markers C. Right speaker icon
Figure 465. Medium Surround Panner

The large surround panner has some sliders at the bottom that the medium surround panner doesn’t have, except for the LFE Send
slider, which the medium panner has. Except for the sliders, the large and medium surround panners have the following controls:

 Angle and Focus marker. A small sphere that you can drag in any direction to both control and display the following two
parameters:

 Angle. This is the perceived angle of the sound source as it differs from the position directly in front of the listener. The scale
is 0 to 180 degrees on the listener’s right, and 0 to -180 degrees on the listener’s left. 0 means the sound is coming from
directly in front of the listener, and plus or minus 180 degrees means that the sound is coming from directly behind the listener.

 Focus. This is the perceived distance of the sound source from the center of the circle on a scale of 0 to 100, 0 meaning the
center of the circle, and 100 meaning the perimeter.

 Width markers. These are two smaller spheres equidistant from the Angle and Focus marker. Their distance from each other
and from the front of the circle shows the Width value (see definition below). You can also drag the Width markers to control Angle
and Focus.

 Speaker icons/squares. Each surround channel is represented by a speaker icon in the large panner, and a white square in
the small panner. The large panner also has a corresponding volume level in dB directly in front of each icon. The position of each
speaker icon shows you each speaker’s position in the surround mix. Clicking a speaker icon or square mutes the corresponding
channel, causing the icon or square to become gray. Double-clicking the icon solos its channel, turning the icon green.

 Angle slider (large panner only). This slider both displays and controls the angle value.
 Focus slider (large panner only). This slider both displays and controls the focus value.

1070

Surround Mixing
Panning in surround

 Width slider (large panner only). This slider both displays and controls the width value. Width is a measure of how wide an
area the sound seems to be coming from on a scale of 0 to 360 degrees. At 0 and 360 degrees, the sound seems to all come from
a single speaker. At 180 degrees the sound seems to come from directly opposite sides. The default angle matches the project’s
left and right channel angle. For example, in 5.1 SMPTE/ITU surround, the default width is 60 degrees.

 Front/Rear Balance slider (large panner only). Abbreviated as FrntRrBl, this slider adjusts the front and rear balance. Drag it
to the left to reduce the level from the front speakers, or drag it to the right to reduce rear level.

 LFE slider. This slider both displays and controls the level of sound sent to the LFE channel.
 LFE Only button (large panner only). This button mutes all channels except the LFE channel.
To open the large surround panner
 Right-click the small surround panner or the pan control in a track, and choose Open Surround Panner from the pop-up menu.
Or

 Select a track and choose Views > Surround Panner, or press ALT+SHIFT+9.
Or

 Double-click outside the Surround Panner circle.
Or

 Press ENTER when the panner has focus.
To change the angle
 In either the large or small surround panner, drag the Angle and Focus marker to the left or right.
Or

 In the large surround panner, drag the Angle slider.
To change the focus
 In either the large or small surround panner, drag the Angle and Focus marker toward or away from the center.
Or

 In the large surround panner, drag the Focus slider.
To mute a surround speaker
 In the large surround panner, click a speaker icon to mute its output. The speaker icon turns gray when the speaker is muted.
Or

 In the small surround panner, click a white square to mute a speaker’s output. The square turns gray when the speaker is muted.
To solo a surround speaker
 In the large surround panner, double-click a speaker icon to solo its output. The speaker icon turns green when the speaker is
soloed.
Or

 In the small surround panner, double-click a white square to solo a speaker’s output. The square turns green when the speaker is
soloed.

To change the width
 In the large surround panner, drag the Width slider.

You can arm or disarm for automation all the controls in a surround panner by clicking any control in the surround panner (except
LFE Solo), and choosing Write Enable from the pop-up menu.

Potential 'pops' when using surround automation
If you record Angle surround pan automation, please note that a pop may occur as the angle parameter jumps from 0 degrees to
180 degrees. This may occur if the jump is not instantaneous, and can be easily solved by zooming in the envelope automation and
moving the top and bottom nodes so they are aligned in time.
Tip: Enable Snap to make it easier to align the envelope nodes.

See:
“Surround metering” on page 1075

Joystick support
Cakewalk allows you to use a joystick to control surround panning. A force-feedback joystick such as the Microsoft® SideWinder®
Force Feedback 2 joystick can add a tactile element to mixing sessions, and add button control to some Cakewalk transport and/or
menu commands with the extra buttons on the joystick module.
The joystick will grab the current pan position/sphere anytime you pull the trigger button (the "firing" button under your index finger).
When recording automation, you write new automation every time you pull the trigger button.
Various joystick buttons can be used to:

 Control Cakewalk’s transport
 Switch focus to adjacent tracks/sends
 Solo/unsolo current channel
 Open/close the large surround panner window
To connect the joystick to Cakewalk
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Control Surfaces.
2. Click the Add button

, and choose Joystick Panner in the Controller/Surface field of the Controller/Surface Settings

3. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.
4. In the Control Bar’s ACT module, select Joystick Panner in the drop-down menu, then click the Controller/Surface Properties
button

.

5. In the Joystick Panner dialog box, select button 1 in the Buttons field, and then select Engage Pan Mode in the Button
Actions field.
6. Now select Button 2, and select Engage Pan Nav Mode in the Button Actions field.
7. Select any other buttons your joystick has (one at a time), and connect them to any transport or menu commands you want in the
Button Actions field; close the Joystick Panner dialog box.
Now when you hold down button 1 (the “trigger button”), the joystick controls the surround panner on the current track or send. When
the pan/sphere is in the desired position, let button 1 up to hold the position. When you hold down button 2, move the joystick
vertically to change the current track, and horizontally to change to a different send control. The Control Bar’s ACT module displays
the names of the current track and send. Use any other buttons you configured to control other Cakewalk functions.
You can save your button assignments as a preset by typing a name for the current group of settings in the Presets window in the
Joystick Panner dialog box, and then clicking the floppy disk icon that’s next to the Presets field. Whenever you want to load a
preset, just select it in the Presets window.

Surround metering
Meters in tracks routed to surround buses or the Surround Main, and meters in surround buses work the same as stereo meters (see
“Metering” on page 1000), however, surround meters display more channels. For example, a project in 5.1 would have a six-channel
meter.
Figure 466. Multi-channel meter.

A

A. Six-channel meter

Each pair of hardware outputs still uses a stereo meter, but you will see the meters on several pairs of outputs displaying levels,
depending on how many surround channels your project uses.
See:
“Bass management” on page 1075

Bass management
A bass management system takes all the frequencies below a certain frequency (normally 80Hz) from the main channels, and the
signal from the LFE channel, and mixes them together into the speaker that is best equipped to handle them. This is usually a
subwoofer, but sometimes the left and right front speakers are used if a subwoofer isn’t available. The reason why this is done is to
make use of the subwoofer for more than the occasional low frequency effect, since the subwoofer is there anyway, and to lower the
effective response of the system to about 25 Hz.
When you encode to Dolby Digital, the LFE channel gets a +10 dB gain on playback from Dolby's decoder. This gives you the option
of delivering some really powerful deep bass during playback, like in that earthquake sound effect in your recording. Consider also
that this +10 dB of low bass can be added to any low bass that came out of the other 5 channels from redirection, so you realistically
can deliver a sound from the subwoofer that is more than +20 dB above the sound from any other speaker.
What this means during mixing is that you would have to turn the analog gain to your subwoofer up 10 dB relative to the other 5
speakers, so that you hear the sound as it will be played back in home theater systems that use bass management, and you will get
your levels set right in the mix.
Cakewalk’s bass management system allows you to monitor how a surround project will sound with bass management, so you don’t
have to change the gain to your subwoofer during mixing. Cakewalk’s bass management system only applies to monitoring, and is
ignored when you export your file.

To monitor with bass management
1. If necessary, open the project you want to use bass management with.
2. Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Surround.
3. Select the Monitor with Bass Management check box.
4. Select an option in the Low Pass Cutoff (Hz) drop-down, and click OK.

Surround effects
Cakewalk lets you use your existing stereo or mono effects as surround effects. Cakewalk does this through the SurroundBridge,
which automatically sets up your existing mono & stereo plug-ins so you can patch them into surround buses (buses, not tracks).
See:
“The SurroundBridge” on page 1076
“Effect property pages” on page 1077
“Effect presets” on page 1077
“How to patch and configure surround effects” on page 1077

The SurroundBridge
The SurroundBridge automatically loads enough instances of a plug-in to handle all your surround channels. For example, if you
patch a stereo effect into a surround bus that uses 5.1 SMPTE/ITU panning, the SurroundBridge automatically assigns the Left and
Right channels of the bus to instance 1 of the plug-in, assigns the Left Surround and Right Surround channels to instance 2, the
Center channel to instance 3, and the LFE channel to instance 4. If you patch a mono effect into a surround bus, the SurroundBridge
assigns each channel to a single instance of the mono effect, which would create six instances of the effect on a 5.1 surround bus.
You can view and edit these assignments on the SurroundBridge tab that’s in the property page of every effect that’s patched into a
surround bus. For example, if you want a certain effect on the Left Surround channel of a surround bus, but not on the Right
Surround channel, you can assign these two channels to different instances of the effect you’re patching by choosing options on the
SurroundBridge tab of the effect’s property page.
The SurroundBridge also links the automatable parameters of each instance so that when you change a parameter in one instance,
you automatically change the same parameter in all the other instances. You can unlink parameters individually, or per-instance (see
“How to patch and configure surround effects” on page 1077).

Effect property pages
A single property page controls all instances of an effect that is patched into a surround bus. The effect’s property page displays a
different tab for each instance of the effect. By default, when you change an automatable parameter on one tab of the property page,
that change is duplicated on all the tabs of the property page. However, you can “unlink” individual parameters from the other tabs by
clicking the Link Automation controls button

in the effect property page, and while the button is disabled, move the parameter

you want to unlink, and then click the Link Automation controls button
again to disable it. Now you can change that parameter
on one tab without changing the same parameter on the other tabs. You can also link or unlink all of an instance’s parameters by
using the controls on the SurroundBridge tab.
See:
“Effect presets” on page 1077
“The SurroundBridge” on page 1076

Effect presets
You can use existing (non-surround) effects presets when you patch an effect to a surround bus—selecting a non-surround preset
sets all of a plug-in’s instances to the settings of the preset; selecting a surround preset sets each instance’s parameters individually,
according to the information stored in the preset.
See:
“How to patch and configure surround effects” on page 1077
“The SurroundBridge” on page 1076
“Effect property pages” on page 1077

How to patch and configure surround effects
For step-by-step instructions, see the following procedures.

To patch an effect into a surround bus
 Right-click the FX Rack of a surround bus and choose a mono or stereo effect from the pop-up menu.
The SurroundBridge patches multiple instances of the effect you chose into the bus’s FX Rack (however, only one effect appears in
the FX Rack), with default assignments of surround channels to plug-in instances.
Note: Mono plug-ins may not work properly when inserted in a Surround bus FX Rack. A common symptom is a Runtime error
message.

To change channel assignments for a patched effect
1. If the effect’s property page is not open, display it by double-clicking the name of the effect in the surround bus’s FX Rack.
2. On the SurroundBridge tab of the effect’s property page, use the drop-down menus in the Left Input and Right Input columns to
assign individual surround channels to instances of the effect.
Your assignments take effect immediately, and the names of the tabs in the property page change to reflect the new assignments.

To unlink individual effect parameters from other effect instances
1. In the property page of an effect that’s patched into a surround bus, click the Link Automation controls button
disabled.

so it is

2. Make some adjustments to the automatable parameters you want to unlink (non-automatable parameters are not linked
together). You can select parameters on any tab. Cakewalk will automatically capture which controls you change and unlink them
from the corresponding controls for the other surround channels.
3. When you’re finished adjusting parameters, click the Link Automation controls button

so it is enabled.

Now you can adjust the parameters you adjusted, without automatically adjusting the same parameters that are on other tabs of the
effect’s property page. As long as the Link Automation controls button

Surround Mixing
Surround effects

is enabled, all other controls will remain linked.

1077

A list of the parameters that you unlinked appears in the Unlinked Controls field on the SurroundBridge tab, with the instance
number listed in the Plug-in # column of the Unlinked Controls field.
If you unlinked some but not all of an instance’s parameters, the instance’s check box in the Controls Linked to Group column
appears gray, with a check.
To view a list of the automatable parameters in a particular effect, uncheck one of the Controls Linked to Group check boxes on
the SurroundBridge tab, and read the list in the Unlinked Controls field.

To relink individual effect parameters to other effect instances
1. In the Unlinked Controls field on the SurroundBridge tab, select the parameters you want to relink—if the parameters you
want to select are adjacent, you can SHIFT-click the first and last ones in the group. If they’re not adjacent, you can CTRL-click
them individually.
2. Click the Relink Controls button.
The parameters you relinked are removed from the list.

To unlink all of an instance’s parameters from other instances
1. In the property page of an effect that’s patched into a surround bus, click the SurroundBridge tab.
2. Find the instance you want to unlink in the Plug-in # column, and uncheck its Controls Linked to Group check box.
The parameters you unlinked appear in the Unlinked Controls field, with the instance number listed in the Plug-in # column of the
Unlinked Controls field.
Note: To relink all of an instance’s parameters, recheck its Controls Linked to Group check box.

To disable an instance
 On the SurroundBridge tab of the effect’s property page, clear the Enable check box of the plug-in you want to disable. The
instance’s tab becomes grayed-out when you do this. You can re-enable the instance by rechecking the check box.
The Enable check box is a separate bypass system from the Bypass button that is on the instance’s individual property tab.
Disabling an instance by using the Enable check box lightens the CPU load by taking the instance out of the processing path. The
Bypass button on the instance’s property tab does not change color when you click the Enable check box, because it is a separate
system. The Bypass button is automatable in some plug-ins.

To save a preset
1. Set the effect’s parameters the way you want them.
2. In the Presets field of the effect’s property page, type a name for the preset, and click the floppy disk icon that’s just right of the
Presets field.
Saving a preset of an effect that’s patched into a surround bus creates a surround preset, which includes channel assignments and
parameter linkage settings.

Importing surround mixes
Cakewalk imports multi-channel (surround) files as a group of mono files. If the files contain information that labels the speaker
location of each channel in the file, Cakewalk copies these labels to the clips in your audio tracks, but does not pan the tracks
according to these labels. This is because you may not have your Cakewalk project set to the same multi-channel format as the
imported project.
You can import the following types of multi-channel files:

 Multi-channel PCM wave files (.wav)
 Dolby AC3 encoded files. (.ac3)—these are encoded for Dolby surround. You will need to install an AC3 decoder filter such as this
one: http://ac3filter.sourceforge.net in order to be able to decode these files in Cakewalk.
Important: After installing the above AC3 codec, go to Control Panel and launch the “AC3 Filter” control panel applet. From
there you can set up the default speaker output for this filter to 5.1 channels. Until you do this it will only stream in stereo. Also
check the sample rate of the imported file. It’s recommended that you set your project sample rate to whatever the file uses
before importing. Otherwise the import process will go through a time consuming resampling pass for each channel.

 Windows Media Pro
To import a surround multi-channel file
1. Use the File > Import > Audio command to open the Import Audio dialog box.
2. Select a file of a supported file type.
3. Check Import As Mono Tracks.
4. Click Open.
Cakewalk imports each channel to a separate mono track.
Tip: You can also rip the soundtrack from a video file by opening the video file directly from the Import Audio dialog box.

ProChannel

ProChannel features a collection of audio processing modules that can be dynamically added, removed, and reordered per audio
track, Instrument track and bus in the Inspector and Console view. Combining compression, equalization, tube saturation modeling,
console emulation, tape emulation, and convolution reverb in one convenient processor, ProChannel is designed to make it fast and
easy to enhance any track or bus.
Figure 468. ProChannel provides compressor, equalizer, tube saturation, console emulation, tape emulation, and convolution reverb processing for
each channel.

Cakewalk includes the following ProChannel modules:

 Compressor. The Compressor modules let you limit the dynamic range and balance the overall level. Compression makes the
loud parts of the signal quieter, resulting in a more even level. Cakewalk includes two different compressor modules:

 PC76 U-Type Channel Compressor. This is the default mode when using ProChannel on a track. This mode is
meticulously modelled after one of the most renowned and famous solid-state (F.E.T.) compressors that is used in
professional studios and recordings. Known to bring out the brightness and presence of a sound. Commonly used on vocal
tracks, but also recommended for stereo drum buses and guitar tracks. For details, see “PC76 U-Type Channel Compressor
module” on page 1095.
Note: The PC76 U-Type Channel Compressor is faithfully modelled after the hardware circuitry of a classic compressor that
does not support sidechaining. Consequently, the PC76 U-Type Channel Compressor does not support sidechaining either. If
you need to use sidechaining, use the PC4K S-Type Bus Compressor mode.

 PC4K S-Type Bus Compressor.

This is the default mode when using ProChannel on a bus. This mode is based on the
legendary center console stereo bus compressor in one of the world's most successful analog studio production mixing
consoles. Known to add punch and drive to a mix. Also recommended for instruments like piano and drums. This mode
supports sidechaining. For details, see “PC4K S-Type Bus Compressor module” on page 1097.

ProChannel

1081

 QuadCurve Equalizer. The QuadCurve Equalizer module allows you to fine tune the frequency spectrum of your music or
sound. You have control over six individual bands, which allows you to attenuate or boost specific frequency ranges and shape
the overall characteristics of the audio signal. Equalization may also be applied creatively, to add presence or enhance certain
frequencies, to remove noise, hum or low-end rumble, for special effects or numerous other purposes. The QuadCurve Equalizer
fly-out panel also includes a real-time FFT spectrum analyzer. For more information, see “QuadCurve Equalizer module” on page
1099.

 PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier. PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier is meticulously modeled after a legendary vintage electrooptical tube compressor. This compressor, known for its automatic gain control characteristics, delivers vintage sound with
incredibly warm and rich compression. It is revered by audio engineers worldwide for its trademark sound, and has been used on
countless hit records since the late 1960s. It is one of the true classics in the audio recording industry. For details, see “PC2A TType Leveling Amplifier” on page 1105.

 Tube Saturation. Digital audio recordings can sometimes sound sterile and lifeless. The Tube Saturation module employs
advanced analog vacuum-tube circuit modeling, which allows you to apply ultra-high-quality analog warmth and saturation to
individual tracks and full mixes. Under the hood are dynamic, virtual vacuum-tubes that mimic the “animated” nature of their real,
analog counterpart as they respond to different audio input. The result is the coveted warm, lively and realistic analog sound of
classic vacuum-tube processors and amplifiers. For details, see “Tube Saturation module” on page 1104.

 Softube Saturation Knob. The Softube Saturation Knob module borrows from Softube’s famous German FET distortion and
compression circuitry modeling, and provides smooth, one-knob, frequency saturation operation for adding just the right amount
of tube warmth to any track. For details, see “Softube Saturation Knob” on page 1109.

 Console Emulator. The Console Emulator module emulates the sound of three classic recording consoles in Cakewalk's mixer.
For details, see “Console Emulator module” on page 1110.

 FX Chain. The FX Chain module lets you save and load audio effect plug-in chain presets called FX Chain. The FX Chain
module can be used as an FX Rack that can be inserted between other ProChannel modules. For details, see “FX Chain module”
on page 1113.

 BREVERB 2 Cakewalk ProChannel. The BREVERB 2 Cakewalk ProChannel module by Overloud provides world-class studio
reverb. Dozens of professional presets are included. Cakewalk includes both VST and ProChannel versions of BREVERB 2
Cakewalk. For details, click the Help button in the BREVERB 2 Cakewalk VST version.

 Tape Emulator. The Tape Emulator module by Overloud lets you add the warmth and richness of analog magnetic tape
saturation to your digital mixes. For details, see “Tape Emulator module” on page 1119.

 REmatrix Solo. The REmatrix Solo module by Overloud is a world-class convolution reverb that includes 100 impulse
responses (IRs) designed by MoReVoX. You can also import your own IRs and control the EQ, length, delay, and stereo field of
any single IR. REmatrix combines the high fidelity of a convolution reverb with the flexibility of an algorithmic reverb. The included
presets were created in real mixing sessions, and are ready-to-use for music production/mixing. For details, see “REmatrix Solo
convolution reverb” on page 1121.

 Style Dial FX. Style Dial FX are powerful audio processing modules with a simple user interface. Each Style Dial FX module
features only a single knob that lets you dial in the desired effect. The knob range goes from subtle to fully processed. Cakewalk
includes the following Style Dial FX:

 GRIT (saturation). Digital audio recordings can sometimes sound sterile and lifeless. The GRIT module provides smooth
frequency saturation operation for adding just the right amount of tube warmth to any track. Dial in anything from warm tube
sound to more of a modern amp overdrive. For details, see “GRIT (saturation) module” on page 1124.

 MAX (volume maximizer). The MAX module is a one-knob volume maximizer that transparently increases the overall
sound loudness of a track or bus by reducing the dynamic range. Use MAX as a convenient track leveler and compressor. For
details, see “MAX (volume maximizer) module” on page 1126.

 SPACE (reverb/ambience). The SPACE module adds reverb/ambience to the audio signal. Simulate environments from
small rooms to huge halls. The space gets increasingly larger as you increase the knob value. For details, see “SPACE
(reverb/ambience) module” on page 1127.

 SMOOTHER (de-esser / de-harsher). The SMOOTHER module is designed for vocals and guitars and removes sibilance
or harsh frequencies without losing presence. For details, see “SMOOTHER (de-esser / de-harsher) module” on page 1128.

1082

ProChannel

 GATER (remove noise). The GATER module is a simple noise gate for removing unwanted noise in a track. For details, see
“GATER (remove noise) module” on page 1129.

 DEPTH (chorus / stereo shaping). The DEPTH module adds a lot of space and makes the sound feel wider and bigger.
For details, see “DEPTH (chorus / stereo shaping) module” on page 1130.

 PULSE (tremolo). The PULSE module adds an auto volume swelling effects, and at higher settings gets a bit of saturation
and modulation. For details, see “PULSE (tremolo) module” on page 1131.

 SHAPER (transient control). The SHAPER module lets you shape the audio signal’s attack phase independently of the
decay/sustain phase. For details, see “SHAPER (transient control) module” on page 1132.
Additional modules will be available in the future from Cakewalk and third party vendors. For help with external ProChannel
modules, select a module and press F1 to open its online Help.

This is the default compressor module when using ProChannel on a track. This module is meticulously modelled after one of the
most renowned and famous solid-state (F.E.T.) compressors that is used in professional studios and recordings. Known to bring out
the brightness and presence of a sound. Commonly used on vocal tracks, but also recommended for stereo drum buses and guitar
tracks.
Note: The PC76 U-Type Channel Compressor is faithfully modelled after the hardware circuitry of a classic compressor that
does not support sidechaining. Consequently, the PC76 U-Type Channel Compressor does not support sidechaining either. If
you need to use sidechaining, use the PC4K S-Type Bus Compressor mode.
The PC76 U-Type Channel Compressor module contains the following controls:

Shows the amount of gain reduction.

 Input. Determines the relative threshold and total amount of gain reduction. The valid range is -20 dB to +40 dB, and the default
value is -0.2 dB.
Tip: The PC76 U-Type Channel Compressor does not have a dedicated threshold control, but instead has a fixed threshold level and
uses the Input control to determine the relative threshold as well as the total amount of gain reduction. To set a specific amount of
compression, first turn the Input and Output controls all the way down, adjust the Attack control in order to engage gain reduction,
then finally adjust the Input control until the desired amount of gain reduction is achieved.

 Attack. Adjusts the time it takes the compressor to respond to the input signal after the threshold level has been reached. A fast
attack setting means that compression will be more or less instant. Using a slower attack setting results in the compression being
gradually increased, allowing for more variations in the signal than the fast setting. Attack should be adjusted according to the
nature of the audio material. The valid range is 0.0 to 1.2 milliseconds, and the default value is 0.4 milliseconds.

 Release. Adjusts the time the compressor takes to go back to an inactive state after the input level has fallen below the
threshold value. Short release times will make the compression more flexible and able to adapt to the input signal, but can cause
fast changes in gain that may sound displeasing to the ears. Longer release times produce a signal with a more even level and
less of a “pumping” effect, but make it harder to maximize the overall compression because changes in the input level cannot be
compensated for quickly enough to make the output volume totally consistent. The valid range is 50.0 milliseconds to 1200
milliseconds, and the default value is 510 milliseconds.

 Output. Applies a final gain adjustment to the post-compression audio signal. The valid range is -40.0 dB to +20.0 dB, and the
default value is -0.4 dB.
Note: The Output control essentially functions as a makeup gain control. Use the Input control to set the desired amount of
limiting, then use the Output control to set the desired output level.

 Ratio. Controls the amount of compression (gain reduction) that will be applied to the signal after the input audio level exceeds
the threshold level. Ratio denotes the difference in dB between input level and output level, i.e. how much the signal above the
threshold level will be compressed. For example, a ratio of 4:1 means that when the input level increases by 4 dB, the output level
of the signal above threshold will only increase by 1 dB. The following ratios are available:

 4. Use when general dynamic range compression is desired.
 8. Use when general dynamic range compression is desired.
 12. Use when peak-limiting is desired.
 20. Use when peak-limiting is desired.
 Nuke. Same effect as if all other ratio buttons are enabled simultaneously. The result is extreme compression, which is often
used for drum recordings.

 Dry/Wet. Adjust the balance between the unprocessed (dry) and processed (wet) audio signal. The valid range is 0 to 100%
and the default value is 100%.

This is the default compressor module when using ProChannel on a bus. This module is based on the legendary center console
stereo bus compressor in one of the world's most successful analog studio production mixing consoles. Known to add punch and
drive to a mix. Also recommended for instruments like piano and drums. This mode supports sidechaining.
The PC4K S-Type Bus Compressor module contains the following controls:

 Clipping LED. Shows if the input signal to the Compressor module is clipping. If there is any distortion in the ProChannel signal
chain, the clipping LEDs let you identify where the clipping occurs.

 Compressor enable/disable
 VU meter.

. Enables/disables the PC4K S-Type Bus Compressor module.

Shows the amount of gain reduction.

 Thresh. Sets the level at which compression occurs. If the input signal level is below the threshold, no compression takes place.
If the threshold level is reached, compression (i.e. automatic gain reduction) occurs, reducing the gain of the input signal
according to the Ratio, Attack and Release settings. The valid range is -30 dB to +20 dB, and the default value is -10 dB.

 Attack. Adjusts the time it takes the compressor to respond to the input signal after the threshold level has been reached. A fast
attack setting means that compression will be more or less instant. Using a slower attack setting results in the compression being
gradually increased, allowing for more variations in the signal than the fast setting. Attack should be adjusted according to the
nature of the audio material. The valid range is 0.1 to 30 milliseconds, and the default value is 0.8 milliseconds.

 Release. Adjusts the time the compressor takes to go back to an inactive state after the input level has fallen below the
threshold value. Short release times will make the compression more flexible and able to adapt to the input signal, but can cause
fast changes in gain that may sound displeasing to the ears. Longer release times produce a signal with a more even level and
less distortion, but make it harder to maximize the overall compression because changes in the input level cannot be
compensated for quickly enough to make the output volume totally consistent. The valid range is 0.1 to 1.2 seconds and Auto.
and the default value is 0.5 seconds. If Auto is selected, the release time is dependent on the duration of the signal peak.

 Make Up. Compensates, or “makes up” for automatic gain reduction. Make-up gain refers to the process of re-balancing the
subjective level of the compressed audio against the uncompressed audio. In other words, make-up gain reduces the difference
in level between the loudest and quietest sounds of the processed audio. As the compressor turns down the peak levels of the
audio that exceeds the threshold level, you may want to turn up the level of the entire compressor to balance the mix. For
example, if you increase the gain so that the peak levels are the same as before compression, the quieter sections of the audio
will also be increased by the same amount, effectively keeping the peaks levels as they were before compression while
increasing the level of the quieter audio. The valid range is -10 dB to +30 dB and Auto, and the default value is 0 dB. If Auto is
selected, the Make Up gain is automatically calculated based on the Ratio and Threshold settings.

 Ratio.

Controls the amount of compression (gain reduction) that will be applied to the signal after the input audio level exceeds
the threshold level. Ratio denotes the difference in dB between input level and output level, i.e. how much the signal above the
threshold level will be compressed. For example, a ratio of 4:1 means that when the input level increases by 4 dB, the output level
of the signal above threshold will only increase by 1 dB. The following ratios are available:

 2. Use when general dynamic range compression is desired.
 4. Use when general dynamic range compression is desired.
 10. Use when peak-limiting is desired.
 Sidechain. Sidechaining is typically used with compressors to limit one signal depending on the signal level of another.
Common applications are to reduce the level of a bass guitar when there is a kick drum, or to reduce the level of music whenever
a speaker talks (often used for background music in radio- and television programs). Audio track, Bus and Send outputs can be
routed to sidechain inputs. The Sidechain sections contains the following controls:

 On/Off. Enables/disables the compressor’s sidechain input as an audio output destination in all Track/Bus/Send Output
controls.

 High Pass. Applies a High Pass filter to the sidechain input. The valid range is OFF to 2 kHz.
 Dry/Wet.

Adjusts the balance between the unprocessed (dry) and processed (wet) audio signal. The range is 0 to 100% and
the default value is 100%.

Default center frequency for each band

 Q. Sets the width of the selected band (Low, Low-Mid, Mid-High and High), which determines the amount of surrounding
frequencies that will be affected when adjusting the band. A low Q value gives a high bandwidth for the filter band, resulting in a
smooth shaping of the sound and little audible 'coloration'. Filtering will however be less accurate, since a wide frequency range
around the center frequency will be affected. A high Q value reduces the bandwidth, improving filter accuracy but also creating
sharp dips or peaks in the frequency spectrum. The width of the Q is expressed in terms of octaves. The valid range is 0.1 to 16.0
and the default value is 1.3.

 Level. Boosts or attenuates the selected band (Low, Low-Mid, Mid-High and High).The valid range is -18.0 dB to +18.0 dB and
the default value is 0 dB. The Level control interacts with the Q parameter, depending in the selected EQ type (Hybrid, Pure, EType or G-Type).

 Low band filter type. Toggles the Low band between Bell and Low Shelf mode. In Bell mode, the Low band boosts or
attenuates a range of frequencies around a central point in a bell shape. In Low Shelf mode, the Low band boosts or attenuates
the set frequency and all frequencies below it.

 High band filter type. Toggles the High band between Bell and High Shelf mode. In Bell mode, the High band boosts or
attenuates a range of frequencies around a central point in a bell shape. In High Shelf mode, the High band boosts or attenuates
the set frequency and all frequencies above it.

PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier is meticulously modeled after a legendary vintage electro-optical tube compressor. This
compressor, known for its automatic gain control characteristics, delivers vintage sound with incredibly warm and rich compression.
It is revered by audio engineers worldwide for its trademark sound, and has been used on countless hit records since the late 1960s.
It is one of the true classics in the audio recording industry.
The purpose of PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier is to limit the dynamic range of a signal by reducing the amplitude of its transient
peaks. PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier varies its gain in response to the level of the input signal. Large input signals result in less
gain, thus reducing or “compressing” the dynamic range of the signal.
The PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier module contains the following controls:

 Clipping LED. Shows if the input signal to the PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier module is clipping. If there is any distortion in the
ProChannel signal chain, the clipping LEDs let you identify where the clipping occurs.

 PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier enable/disable

. Enables/disables the PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier module.

 Limit/Compress. Changes the dynamic processing ratio between compressor and limiter. The compression ratio fluctuates
depending on the frequency of the incoming signal.

Note: PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier is not a limiter by modern standards, which typically have a fixed Infinity:1 ratio. If you
need to use a brickwall-type limiter, a limiter such as ProChannel Concrete Limiter is a better choice than PC2A T-Type Leveling
Amplifier.

 Limit. In Limit mode, the compression ratio ranges between 4:1 for low frequencies and 20:1 for high frequencies. Limiting can
be used in many ways, including:
• Creating a louder or fuller sound by limiting the dynamic range and increasing the perceived overall level of the mix.
• Increasing the volume and density of individual instruments in the mix.
• Preventing digital overs and other types of overload protection. Think of it as an audio safety net that puts a cap on the
overall level. A limiter is the most transparent way to boost average level without clipping.
• Creatively sculpting a sound’s dynamics.

 Compress. In Compress mode, the compression ratio ranges between 3.5:1 for low frequencies and 6:1 for high
frequencies. This method is suitable for leveling and reducing the general dynamic range of individual instrument tracks such
as vocals and drums. It produces a more gentle compression.

 VU meter. The VU meter can be switched to show gain reduction or output level, depending on the position of the VU meter
mode knob.

ProChannel

1105

 VU meter mode. Switches the VU meter to show gain reduction or output level.There are four available modes:
 GR. Displays the instantaneous gain reduction in dB. During periods of no gain reduction, the pointer will return to 0 VU on
the meter scale.

 +10. Displays the post-processing output level, referenced to +10 dBm (analog emulation).
 +4. Displays the post-processing output level, referenced to +4 dBm (analog emulation).
 dBFS. Displays the post-processing output level in the digital domain. This is the true output meter for digital audio, and is
the recommended setting when monitoring output level.

Note: The output meter of the PC2A Leveling Amplifier has a different value than the original hardware it emulates. With analog
hardware, 0 dB typically represents the nominal signal level. Anything above 0 dB is considered “headroom” in the analog
domain. Its clipping or peak level is often around +20 dB, depending on the manufacturer. In this case, the hardware being
emulated has a nominal level of +10 dB and peaks at +16 dB. The original hardware is analog, therefore the output metering
does not conform to the dB-FS (Decibel-Full Scale) range of a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) such as Cakewalk. In order to
keep metering accurate in the digital domain, PC2A Leveling Amplifier also includes a dBFS meter option, which accurately
depicts the level meter and headroom in the digital domain.

 Gain. Adjusts the post-compression output level, or make-up gain. Use this control to make up for the gain lost by the peak
reduction. The Gain knob has no affect on the amount of compression. To adjust the knob in fine increments, hold down the
SHIFT key while moving the knob.

 Peak reduction. Adjusts both the threshold and the amount of compression (gain reduction). If the input signal level is below
the threshold, no compression takes place. Turn the knob clockwise for more compression, or counter-clockwise for less. To
adjust the knob in fine increments, hold down the SHIFT key while moving the knob.

 R37 (High Frequency Pre-emphasis trim). Adjusts the gain reduction frequency response. The original hardware unit was
designed for leveling in radio and TV broadcast applications. Due to an increase in high frequency content in FM broadcasting,
the R37 control adds gain reduction at frequencies above 1kHz, based on the program material. Use this control to reduce or
prevent over-modulation caused by the pre-emphasis (high-frequency sensitivity). When set to the FLAT position, gain reduction
is applied equally on all frequencies. When the control is moved toward the HF position, gain reduction is increased on the high
frequencies. Experiment to achieve a good balance between low and high frequency limiting. This control is often useful for deessing vocals (cut down sibilance by compressing high frequencies), but the FLAT setting is recommended for most music
applications. To adjust the knob in fine increments, hold down the SHIFT key while moving the knob.

Tip: If you want the sound of the PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier but need more control over the attack and release times, place
another compressor in front of the PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier, such as the PC76 U-Type Channel Compressor, to act on the
peaks, then use the PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier for general compression. For details, see “Using PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier
on drums” on page 1108.
The purpose of a compressor is to limit the dynamic range of music or sound. Compression will make the loud parts of the signal
more quiet, resulting in a more or less even level. Compression is usually applied to compensate for the small variations in level that
occur when a musician plays an instrument or a vocalist sings a song.
PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier is a soft-knee compressor that features program dependent release times and a flat frequency
response of 30Hz to 15kHz (see R37 control for frequency response adjustment) The attack time is fixed at 10 milliseconds. The
release time is roughly 60 milliseconds for 50% release, and 0.5 to 5 seconds for full release, depending on the previous program
material. The two-stage release results in very transparent compression characteristics.
PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier models the tubes and the T4 electro-optical device in the original hardware units. The T4 circuit
uses an electroluminescent panel to determine the attack time, and an optical photo cell to determine the release time. All based on
the incoming program material. The T4 has very little distortion. To realize the characteristic sound of the original hardware, the
tubes are also modeled to add analog characteristics. Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) comes from the four tubes in the original
hardware, which slightly changes the signal shape adding even and odd harmonics based on the frequency of the program material.
The THD has a slight effect on the output gain, less than 0.35% to 0.75% at +10 dB to +16 dB of the program material.
The modeling of the tubes and the T4 circuit is what gives PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier its unique compression characteristics.
The curves are “wobbly” and only reduce gain to a certain point before “giving in” and letting the output level increase again. Unlike
typical dynamics processors that have a fixed compression ratio across all frequencies, the PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier gain
reduction is different at different frequencies.

PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier is suitable for just about any audio material. It sounds especially good on vocals, and also works
great on guitar, electric and upright bass, guitars, piano, wind instruments, and other tracks that need gentle compression. It even
works well on full-program mixes.

Note: The original hardware unit is mono, and can be linked with a second unit for stereo leveling. PC2A T-Type Leveling
Amplifier operates in both mono and stereo modes without a loss in stereo imaging.

 Up to 40 dB of gain reduction.
Using PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier
PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier is suitable for just about any audio material. It sounds especially good on vocals, and also works
great on guitar, electric and upright bass, guitars, piano, wind instruments, and other tracks that need gentle compression. It even
works well on full-program mixes.
Percussive instruments that have a lot of peaks, such as drums, may require more care. Although PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier
works great for certain kick drum sounds, you may want to combine PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier with another compressor with a
faster release time and more precise control. For details, see “Using PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier on drums” on page 1108.
Unlike a traditional compressor that has Ratio, Threshold, Attack, Release and Make-up Gain controls, PC2A T-Type Leveling
Amplifier is very straightforward with only two primary controls: Gain and Peak Reduction. Peak Reduction controls the amount of
compression and Gain controls the post-processed output level.
The most common problem caused by the use of a compressor/limiter is excessive distortion. This normally indicates that the limiter
is active too much of the time (threshold is too low). To correct the distortion, turn the Peak Reduction knob counter-clockwise.

Typical workflow
1. Insert the PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier module on a track or bus.
2. Right-click any ProChannel module header and make sure Post FX Bin is not selected on the pop-up menu. In most situations,
you want to apply compression before effects like reverb and delay.
3. While listening to the project, adjust the Peak Reduction control until the compressor exhibits the desired amount of
compression. You may want to set the VU meter to show gain reduction (GR). A good target is to keep the gain reduction around
4-8 dB continuously.
4. If desired, adjust the R37 (pre-emphasis) control according to the amount of high frequency content in the audio material. Turn
the knob counter-clockwise to increase compression of high-frequency content, such as vocal sibilance.
5. Adjust the Gain control to achieve the desired output level. You may want to set the VU meter to show output level (dBFS, +10 or
+4).
6. Toggle the PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier enable/disable control to compare the compressed signal with the unprocessed
signal.

Using PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier on drums
Used carefully, PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier can make drum tracks sound fuller and bigger.
By itself, however, PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier is not well-suited for compressing drums and other percussive instruments that
have lots of peaks. The reason is due to the slower release time and lack of precise control, thus changes in the input level cannot
be compensated for quickly enough to make the output volume totally consistent.
A good compression trick is to chain different compressors together on the same track. This lets you use another compressor with a
faster release time and more precise control as a peak limiter to first tame the peaks before they reach PC2A T-Type Leveling
Amplifier, then use PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier for general compression.

Note: When chaining multiple compressors together, each successive compressor should have a lower compression ratio than
the one before it.
As a starting point, place PC76 U-Type Channel Compressor in front of PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier. Configure PC76 U-Type
Channel Compressor as a peak limiter: set a high compression ratio, like 12:1, and a fairly fast attack and release. Set the Input
Gain carefully so the highest peaks are reduced by 2-3 dB, then adjust the Output Gain until you can’t hear a difference between
the pre- and post-processed level (frequently enable/disable PC76 U-Type Channel Compressor so you can compare the pre- and
post-processed levels). The goal is to only flatten the highest peaks, and not compress the overall audio signal.
Next, configure PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier for general compression: set Compress/Limit to Compress, and adjust Gain and
Peak Reduction to taste.
In summary, first use a compressor with precise control to act on the peaks, followed by PC2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier for general
compression.

Tip: Another common technique is to use parallel bus compression. This is achieved by sending all of your drum tracks to a bus,
replicating your level and pan controls for each auxiliary send. Insert the PC2A Leveling Amplifier ProChannel module on the bus, and
use a fairly large amount of peak reduction. Finally, blend the bus from 0 dB upward, with the drums soloed, until the desired amount
of parallel compression is achieved.

The Saturation Knob module borrows from Softube’s famous German FET distortion and compression circuitry modeling, and
provides smooth, one-knob, frequency saturation operation for adding just the right amount of tube warmth to any track.
Use Saturation Knob anywhere you need some grit. Use it to fatten up bass lines, add harmonics and shimmer to vocals, or squash
a drum loop.
The Saturation Knob module contains the following controls:

 Clipping LED. Shows if the input signal to the Saturation Knob module is clipping. If there is any distortion in the ProChannel
signal chain, the clipping LEDs let you identify where the clipping occurs.

 Saturation Knob enable/disable

 LED. Indicates when the input signal is being processed.
 Type. Use the saturation Type switch to get three different kinds of characters of distortion. The following types are available:
 Keep High. Does not distort the highest frequencies. On vocals, this usually gives a brighter or harsher vocal sound.
 Neutral. Treats all frequencies equally.
 Keep Low. Prevents the bass from distorting too much. This mode is recommended for drum tracks if you want to squash a
drum loop but prevent the loss of low end in the bass drum, or for retaining more low end on vocal tracks.

When recording to analog tape, the mixing console is the centerpiece of the studio. The audio signal is affected as it passes through
the circuitry of the console. Each console employs a different design and components, which adds to the sonic imprint of each
console. There are various elements that define the sound of each console.
Digital audio is often accused of lacking “character”. Although mixing entirely inside a computer (often referred to as “mixing in the
box”) has many benefits, it can sometimes lack the character of using an analog mixing console.
The Console Emulator module emulates the sonic characteristics of three classic mixing consoles. This has nothing to do with EQ
and compression, but rather mimics the subtle non-linear distortion and noise that occurs when passing an audio signal through a
mixing console’s analog circuit.
The Console Emulator module is based on the following principles:

 Input transformer emulation, which introduces hysteresis and frequency dependent saturation.
 Frequency response shaping of the channel.
 Bias drift of the active stages.
 Component tolerance simulation by slightly changing the filter's values in the different channels.
 Saturation of the mix bus.
 Crosstalk on stereo buses.
Just like an analog console, the overall sound character is the sum of all the separate processing stages. Depending on the console
type and settings, some of the benefits you may experience include:

 A wider sound stage.
 Increased sense of spatial cohesion.
 More depth and definition.
 A bit more warmth and aggression.
 Easier to balance levels across tracks.

Controls
There are two versions of the Console Emulator module:

 Console Emulator Channel. This version is designed for individual tracks.
 Console Emulator Bus. This version is designed for buses. It contains the same controls as the Channel version, except it
does not have a Trim control.
Figure 492. Console Emulator Channel and Bus modules.
Console Emulator Channel

Console Emulator Bus

The Console Emulator module contains the following controls:

 Mode. Selects the desired console emulation mode. For each mode, the Console Emulator module closely resembles the
hardware it is modeled after.

 S-Type. Emulates a clean and transparent British console that is popular among mixing engineers in rock and pop genres.
This console has potentially been used on more platinum selling albums than all other consoles combined.

 N-Type. Emulates a British console that is used in legendary recording studios, including Abbey Road, The Village, Ocean
Way, and Skywalker Sound. This console is warm and has a rich low end.

 A-Type. Emulates a revolutionary British console, of which only 13 consoles were ever built. This console was made famous
at Trident Studios and Cherokee Studios. This console has a brighter top and less lows than the N-Type console. Some
consider this best sounding console of all time.

 Clipping LED. Shows if the input signal to the Console Emulator module is clipping. If there is any distortion in the ProChannel
signal chain, the clipping LEDs let you identify where the clipping occurs.

 Console Emulator enable/disable

.

Enables/disables the Console Emulator module.

 Output VU meters. These meters are calibrated to function responsively, just like real-world meters. These meters fully support
proper gain-staging needed for professional mixing situations and let the user make a better judgment of the volume needed for a
particular track.

 RMS/Peak. The VU meters can be switched to show RMS or Peak levels. Choose RMS to display more of an average of the
amplitudes that occur in a complete cycle of a frequency. RMS, or Root-Mean-Square, is a little over seventy percent of peak
level. Choose Peak to display the highest amplitude in the signal that occurs in a complete cycle of a frequency.

 Trim. Adjusts the input gain. The valid range is 0% to 100% and the default setting is 0%. This control is only available in the
Console Emulator Channel module, not in the Console Emulator Bus module. Hold down the SHIFT key to adjust the control with
finer resolution.

 Drive. Adjusts how much of the pre-processed input signal enters into saturation. For example, in an analog hardware mixer, if
you put all the channel faders at +3 dB, the summing circuits will saturate more than if the channels faders are set to 0 dB. With
this parameter, you can control the amount of summing saturation. The valid range is -6.0 dB to +6.0 dB and the default setting is
0 dB. Hold down the SHIFT key to adjust the control with finer resolution.
Note: The Drive parameter faithfully emulates the behavior of a fader on a real hardware console when the Drive value is
between -6 dB and +2 dB. The Drive range is extended and goes beyond its hardware counterpart, allowing creative processing
when the value is between +2 dB and +6 dB.

 Tolerance. Simulates the component tolerances of the bus circuits. Even if all the channels in a mixer are in theory equal to
each other as they are composed by the same electrical components, in practice these components can be slightly different
among the channels. For example, a 2Kohm resistor could be 1.98Kohm on channel 1, 2.03Kohm on channel 2 and 1.99Kohm on
channel 3, and so on. By enabling the Tolerance switch, the Console Emulator module will sound slightly different on different
channels. These differences are saved into the song state, so it can be recalled when you reload the session.

How to use the Console Emulator
To get the full benefit of console emulation, you typically want to add the Console Emulator module to all audio tracks and buses
across your project.
The audible results may appear subtle when first using the Console Emulator module. In fact, you may not hear any difference at all
at first. This is especially true if you insert the Console Emulator module after you have already mixed a song.
The effect is subtle when listening to individual tracks or buses. Keep in mind that the effect is accumulative, so the effect will
become more noticeable as you add Console Emulator to multiple tracks.
The trick is to insert the Console Emulator module before you start mixing. All your mixing decisions will then be made based on
having the Console Emulator module in the signal chain. When you are done mixing, you can globally enable/disable the Console
Emulator module to A/B the results, and you will likely hear a noticeable difference.
Guidelines:

 You will typically want to insert the Console Emulator module as the first module, and make sure ProChannel has Post FX Rack
disabled. However, you can also experiment with placing the Console Emulator module at the end and enable Post FX Rack, so
all your effects and processed sound are affected.

 Add the Console Emulator module to all audio tracks and buses across your project, and use Quick Groups to easily control
multiple instances simultaneously. To do so, select all tracks, then hold down the CTRL key while you insert or modify the Console
Emulator module.

 Leave the Console Emulator module active throughout the mixing process, “working” the mix through the plug-in.
Tip: Add the Console Emulator module to the default ProChannel layout. This way, the Console Emulator module is always available
on all tracks. Use the same console mode on all tracks and buses.

The Tape Emulator module emulates the sonic characteristics of analog tape recordings, and provides extensive control with
adjustable tape speed, bias and noise parameters.
Digital audio is often accused of lacking “character”. Although mixing entirely inside a computer has many benefits, it can sometimes
lack the character of using an analog mixing console and analog magnetic tape.
Digital audio can capture audio levels up to 0 dB before undesirable clipping occurs. This is known as overload. Analog tape
recordings also have an upper limit, but unlike digital clipping, the signal compresses and distorts slightly as you approach the limit.
There is typically a “sweet spot” of a few decibels before undesirable distortion occurs. Because tape saturation sounds pleasing to
most people, recording engineers have long been using it as a creative mixing tool.
The Tape Emulator module lets you add the analog warmth and richness of magnetic tape saturation to your digital mixes. Use it on
individual mono or stereo tracks, or on buses.
Unlike real analog tape, the Tape Emulator gives you the flexibility of applying tape saturation to individual tracks, and only where
desired. For example, you may want to apply heavy tape saturation to drums, a little less to bass guitar, but not to vocals, etc.

What is tape saturation?
Tape saturation occurs when you try to record too loud and varying signal levels onto magnetic tape for it to accurately reproduce,
whereby the input signal is no longer directly proportional to the recorded signal. During playback, the tape reproduces less energy
than was originally there, which is the saturation effect. Recording engineers often experience this as a result of trying to record a
signal that is loud enough to overcome ever-present tape hiss.
Unlike digital distortion, analog tape saturation can sound pleasing in the right situations, especially on drums.
Tape saturation adds subtle non-linear distortion, compression and EQ, which can add grittiness and bottom end to your tracks. This
is often perceived as “punch” and “warmth”.

Controls
The Tape Emulator module contains the following controls:

 Clipping LED. Shows if the input signal to the Tape Emulator module is clipping. If there is any distortion in the ProChannel
signal chain, the clipping LEDs let you identify where the clipping occurs.

 Tape Emulator enable/disable

. Enables/disables the Tape Emulator module.

 Noise. Adjusts the level of simulated tape hiss
 Rec Level. Applies a gain adjustment to the pre-processed audio signal (input level). Higher values cause increased
compression/saturation.

 PB Level. Applies a final gain adjustment to the post-processed audio signal (output level).
 Tape Spd. Adjusts the simulated tape speed, which impacts the compression behavior. There are two settings:
 7.5 INS. Represents a slow tape speed, which has a more compressed and warm tone, lacking of high frequencies.
 15 INS. Represents a standard tape speed, and causes faster compression attack times.
 Bias. Magnetic tape has a non-linear response at low signal strengths. Tape bias is designed to improve the fidelity of low-signal
analogue magnetic tape sound recordings by pushing the signal into the linear zone of the tape’s transfer function. This results in
less low- and mid-frequency harmonic distortions. There are two settings:

 Over.

Reduces distortion in the low and mid frequency range, particularly on sibilant sounds, and interacts with the Noise

level.

 Normal. Represents a standard level of distortion.
 Link. When Link is enabled, the Rec Level and PB Level knobs are linked to help maintain unity gain. When disabled, the Rec
Level and PB Level knobs can be operated independently.

The REmatrix Solo module by Overloud is a world-class convolution reverb that includes 100 impulse responses (IRs) designed by
MoReVoX. You can also import your own IRs and control the EQ, length, delay, and stereo field of any single IR.
REmatrix combines the high fidelity of a convolution reverb with the flexibility of an algorithmic reverb. The included presets were
created in real mixing sessions, and are ready-to-use for music production/mixing.
The REmatrix Solo module contains the following controls:

 Clipping LED. Shows if the input signal to the REmatrix Solo module is clipping. If there is any distortion in the ProChannel
signal chain, the clipping LEDs let you identify where the clipping occurs.

 REmatrix Solo enable/disable

. Enables/disables the REmatrix Solo module.

 Preset. Shows selected preset name. Click to select another preset, or use the left and right arrow buttons to scroll through the
available presets.

 IR display. Shows the name and waveform of the selected IR. Click the down arrow button to select another IR, or click the left
and right arrow buttons to scroll through the available internal IRs. Internal IRs are grouped by type, and the selected IR name is
prefixed with a letter that indicates its type:

 [H] = Hall
 [R] = Room
 [P] = Plate
 [E] = Early
 [S] = Special
 [U] = User

ProChannel

 Time. Sets the overall duration of the reverb.
 Delay. Adds a pre-delay before the initial processing of the IR takes place. This control allows you to adjust the response time of
the IR.

 Stereo. Adjusts the stereo width.
 EQ Gain. Adjusts the EQ gain of the processed signal.
 EQ Freq. Sets the center frequency of the EQ.
 EQ Q. Sets the width of the EQ's center frequency, which determines the amount of surrounding frequencies that will be
affected when adjusting the EQ. The width of the Q is expressed in terms of octaves. At the minimum value, the EQ functions as
a High Shelf filter. At the maximum value, the EQ functions as a Low Pass filter.

 Dry/Wet. Adjusts the balance between the unprocessed (dry) and processed (wet) audio signal.
 Bypass. Temporarily bypasses the REmatrix Solo module.
 About. Click to show the About box. Click any empty space to return to the standard REmatrix Solo interface.
To import your own IR files
To import your own IR files, click the down arrow button in the IR display section, point to USER on the pop-up menu, then click
Import. REmatrix Solo supports .wav and .aiff files.
Any imported impulse responses can now be selected from the same User menu.

Tip: REmatrix Solo adds all your IRs into one big file named userIRs.rir which is located at
C:\Users\Public\Documents\Overloud\REmatrix Solo\userIRs.rir.
To prevent the User menu from getting too unwieldy, you can rename the userIRs.rir file (e.g., userIRs_original.rir) so any existing
IRs don’t appear, then experiment with loading the new IRs. This will create a new userIRs.rir file. Make a note of which IRs are
your favorites, delete the userIRs.rir file, then rename the userIRs_original.rir file back to userIRs.rir, and finally
re-import only your favorite IRs.

GRIT (saturation) module
The GRIT module provides smooth, one-knob, frequency saturation operation for adding just the right amount of tube warmth to any
track.
Use GRIT anywhere you need some grit. Use it to fatten up bass lines, add harmonics and shimmer to vocals, or squash a drum
loop.

The GRIT module contains the following controls:

 Clipping LED. Shows if the input signal to the GRIT module is clipping. If there is any distortion in the ProChannel signal chain,
the clipping LEDs let you identify where the clipping occurs.

 GRIT enable/disable

.

Enables/disables the GRIT module.

 GRIT. Adjusts the amount of saturation. Increase saturation to get better definition in the bass and get some edge in vocal
tracks. The GRIT knob range goes from a warm tube sound to more of a modern amp overdrive.

What is tape saturation?
Tape saturation occurs when you try to record too loud and varying signal levels onto magnetic tape for it to accurately reproduce,
whereby the input signal is no longer directly proportional to the recorded signal. During playback, the tape reproduces less energy
than was originally there, which is the saturation effect. Recording engineers often experience this as a result of trying to record a
signal that is loud enough to overcome ever-present tape hiss.
Unlike digital distortion, analog tape saturation can sound pleasing in the right situations, especially on drums. Analog tape signals
will compress if the tape begins to saturate.
Tape saturation adds subtle non-linear distortion, compression and EQ, which can add grittiness and bottom end to your tracks. This
is often perceived as “punch” and “warmth”.

Dithering
Dithering. Whenever an audio signal is converted from a higher-bit resolution to a lower resolution, it is necessary to apply dither
to avoid introducing undesirable quantization noise or harmonic distortion into the signal. The purpose of dither is to reduce the
resulting distortion by adding low-level random noise or “dither” to the audio signal. Different mathematical calculations are used to
generate dither, each method has advantages and disadvantages depending on the particular operation. Cakewalk features the
Pow-r dithering process, short for Psycho-acoustically Optimized Wordlength Reduction, which can produce lower-bit files that
sound indistinguishable from higher-bit source files. When this option is turned on, Cakewalk uses dithering when you export a
higher-bit file at a lower resolution, or lower the bit depth of a project’s audio files by using the Utilities > Change Audio Format
command, or when you “render” audio (bounce, freeze, or apply effects).
Cakewalk offers five kinds of dithering:

 Rectangular. Essentially white noise, no noise shaping. Advantages: least CPU-intensive, lowest signal-to-noise ratio,
preferable to shaped dither when successive dithering can occur (e.g. bouncing, freezing). Disadvantages: suffers from
intermodulation distortion, higher perceived loudness than Pow-r dither.

 Triangular. Higher level than rectangular, no noise shaping. Advantages: low CPU-intensive dither, superior to Rectangular
as it does not suffer from modulation noise effects. Preferable to shaped (Pow-r) dither when successive dithering can occur
(e.g. bouncing, freezing). Disadvantages: higher perceived loudness than Pow-r dither.

 Pow-r 1. Noise-shaped dither. Advantages: less CPU-intensive than Pow-r types 2 and 3, lower perceived loudness than
Rectangular or Triangular. Disadvantages: less noise shaping than Pow-r types 2 and 3, not recommended for operations
where dither will be applied successively (e.g. bounce and freeze).

 Pow-r 2. Noise-shaped dither. Advantages: lowest perceived loudness, highest quality settings, recommended for audio
export. Disadvantages: highest CPU-intensive settings, not recommended for operations where dither will be applied
successively (e.g. bounce and freeze).

 Pow-r 3. Same as Pow-r 2 except most CPU-intensive and transparent of all choices.
To choose dithering options
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording.
2. Click the Dithering list and choose the kind of dithering you want to use.
3. Click OK.

Cakewalk External Encoder Config utility
Cakewalk supports external command-line encoders, such as LAME, Ogg Vorbis, Monkey's Audio, etc. If an external command-line
encoder is installed on your machine, the 'Cakewalk External Encoder Config' utility allows you to add the encoder to Cakewalk's list
of available file formats when exporting audio (File > Export > Audio).
To use the utility, start Cakewalk and go to Utilities > Cakewalk Ext Encoder Config, then specify the proper settings or the
encoder you want to use.
See:
“Exporting audio” on page 1135
“Exporting” on page 1133

Encoding options
After clicking the Export button, an additional dialog box will appear showing Extra Encoding Options. These options typically
determine the bit depth, endian-ness (the byte ordering in memory used to represent the data), and an encoding type within the
major file format.

Exporting to Wave format
To export audio to Wave file format
1. Set all volume, pan, effects, and automation settings just as you want them.
2. If you only want to mix down parts of tracks, select those clips now. If you don’t select anything, everything is selected.
3. If you are using effects on the tracks and want to mix the effects down at this time, select the whole length of the longest track or
clip plus extra time for the reverb or effects “tail.”
4. Choose File > Export > Audio to open the Export Audio dialog box.
5. Under Filename and Location, enter a filename and select a destination folder.
6. Under Format, select one of the following from the File Type drop-down list:

 Wave. Choose this if you want to export a standard wave file, or if you’re exporting a surround project in wave format.
 Broadcast Wave (time-stamped). Choose this if you want to create a Broadcast Wave file (see Broadcast Wave).
7. Click Channel Format and select one of the following options:

 Follow Source. Create stereo files for stereo tracks, or mono files for mono tracks.
 Mono. Creates a separate mono file for each track or bus selected in the Sources list.
 Stereo. Creates a separate stereo file for each track or bus selected in the Sources list.
 Split Mono. Creates separate mono files for each track or bus selected in the Sources list. Stereo tracks/buses are split into
separate files for the left and right channels. If the selected bus is a surround bus, the selected bus produces as many mono
files as the bus has channels.

 Multichannel. All exported tracks in a Surround project are mixed down to a multichannel file containing the number of
channels listed in Edit > Preferences > Project - Surround.
8. Click Sample Rate and select the desired sample rate.
9. Click Bith Depth and select the desired bit depth. If your source file is 16 and you export to 24, you get more precision for any
audio effects in the mix (and a larger file). If your source file is 24 and you export to 16, you lose some sound definition, but you
get some of it back if the Dithering option is on in the Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording dialog box (see
“Dithering” on page 1136 for more information).
10. Under What to Export, select one of the following Source Category options:

 Tracks. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each track that you
select in the Sources list. The audio is captured at each of the selected track outputs, before it reaches any buses.
Note: When the Source Category is Tracks, the project selection has a special meaning:
• Having a project selection means that there is a time selection. If tracks are selected in the project, then all the tracks
selected in the Sources list will be exported at exactly the length of the selection. All exported files will be the same duration.
• If there is no selection, then no specific export time range has been set, and the duration of each tracks’ audio file will be the
length of each individual track.

 Tracks Through Entire Mix.

Exports individual tracks, including all downstream bus effects and automation, as heard
through the main output. The result is the same as if you solo one track at a time during export.

 Track Folders. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each track
folder that you select in the Sources list, as heard through the main output. The result is the same as if you solo one track
folder at a time during export.

 Buses. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each bus that you
select in the Sources list. The audio is captured at each of the selected bus outputs.

 Hardware Outputs. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each
hardware output that you select in the Sources list. The audio is captured at each of the selected hardware outputs.

 Entire Mix. Creates a single file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) as heard through the
main output.

 Clips. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each clip in the current
project selection.

arrangement that you select in the Sources list.

 Arranger Sections. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each
Arranger section that you select in the Sources list, as heard through the main output.
11. In the Sources list, select the buses or tracks you want to use as a source to create your mix. If you chose Tracks in the Source
Category field, only tracks will show up as choices in this field.
12. Under Mix and Render, choose the elements you want to include in the mixdown. If you want to exclude muted tracks and/or
include only soloed tracks, make sure Track Mute/Solo is checked.
Note 1: If you have patched a synth into a track or bus, make sure you check Track FX to include synths that are patched into
tracks, and check Bus FX to include synths that are patched into buses.

Note 2: If you don’t check Track Automation, any initial volume and pan settings in an exported track are ignored and the
track’s audio data will be exported at the level that exists in the track, with pan set to center. If you don’t check Clip Automation,
any trim settings are ignored during export. If you don’t check Bus Automation, any volume and balance settings at the main
outs are ignored.
13. If you want to save the settings you created in the Export Audio dialog box, type a name in the Preset box, then press ENTER
or click the Create Preset button

Accommodating effect tails during clip export
Effect tails are the reverberations or signal delay that continue after the source has stopped. If your project uses track or clip plug-in
effects (reverb, delay, etc.) that result in effect tails, you will need to extend the duration of the exported clips in order to properly
accommodate the effect tails. Otherwise, the exported clips will end prematurely, before the effect tail is finished.
You can tell Cakewalk to automatically add a specific amount of time to each exported clip. To specify how much time to add to all
exported clips to accommodate effect tails, go to Edit > Preferences > File - Audio Data and specify the global Clip Tail Duration
N Seconds value. Set the value high enough to allow for any delay or reverb or other effect that you may have patched into a track.

Exporting OMF files
OMF (Open Media Format) files are designed for cross-platform compatibility. For more information about the OMF format, see
“Importing OMF projects” on page 384.
If you plan to export a Cakewalk project to another program that can read OMF files, it pays to consider three things before you start
your Cakewalk project:

 Sample rate and audio bit depth of the target system
 Number of tracks the target system can handle
 Cakewalk and most other audio programs do not include video in the OMF file
To export a project as an OMF file
1. Select File > Export > OMF.
The Export OMF dialog box appears.
2. Enter a File Name (maximum 64 characters—Cakewalk limits name length for ISO CDR compatibility), and in the Save As Type
field, choose OMF Version 1 or 2. Most applications expect Version 2, but check with your engineer.
3. Audio Packaging: usually you should choose Embed Audio Within OMF, which includes the audio data in the OMF file. But you
should check with your engineer.
4. Split Stereo Tracks Into Dual Mono. See what your engineer wants. If exporting a 24-bit project to a Pro Tools system, enable
Split Stereo Tracks Into Dual Mono, as some Pro Tools systems do not support 24-bit interleaved stereo files.
5. Include Archived Tracks.

You can choose to include archived tracks in your exported file.

6. Mix Each Groove Clip As A Separate Clip. If you have several Groove Clips in a track Cakewalk exports them as one clip
unless you check this option. If you check this option, Cakewalk has to do a separate export operation for each Groove Clip in
the track, which is very time-consuming. If you only have one Groove Clip in a track, and you have rolled out numerous
repetitions of the clip, Cakewalk exports a single clip that is the length of the original clip and all the repetitions, which is not a
time-consuming operation.
7. Audio Format.

Ask your engineer what format the studio uses, Windows (RIFF Wave) or Mac (AIFC).

8. Click the Save button.
9. Cakewalk exports the project as an OMF file. In the Save as Type field, select the OMF version you want to save the project as.
Version 1 is compatible with older applications. See your target application’s documentation for information on which version it
supports.
Note: OMF files save the following:

Exporting via drag and drop
You can export audio and MIDI clips by dragging to the Media Browser or any Windows folder (such as the desktop, etc.).

To export audio or MIDI clips to the Media Browser
Drag the clip(s) to the desired location in the Media Browser or any folder.
By default, audio clips are exported with the following settings:

 Format: Wave
 Bit depth: same as original clip
 Sample rate: same as current project
 Dithering: off
If you want to specify various options when exporting audio, you can use the File > Export > Audio command instead.

Batch exporting audio files using task queues
Using the Export button is fine if you have a single export. But what if you want to tweak your project and export again, or you want
several different types of exports? You may want a task for exporting your stems, another task for exporting individual tracks, and
another for exporting your final mix as a stereo file.
You can create multiple export tasks, such as stems or different file formats, and add them to an export queue. A task in the export
queue contains the set of export settings including the mix settings, filename, location, selection, and the time range. You can add as
many export tasks as you like, and run all export tasks as a batch without any user intervention.
The task queue is per project and is saved with the project.

Adding a task to the queue
1. To create a task, simply go through the normal process of defining your export, then instead of clicking the Export button, click
the Add Task to Queue button

. This adds a task with the current settings to the task queue.

If you are exporting multiple files as part of a task, a list of the filenames will be shown in a confirmation prompt. Any further
prompts required for additional format settings will also be shown at this time, and … that way, you won’t get any prompts when
you actually run the task.
2. Once you’ve confirmed any prompts, enter a name for your new task. Simply type the name of the task in, and press ENTER.
Tip: The name of the task can also be used in your filename by using the {taskname} tag.

3. Repeat the above steps for any additional tasks you need.
To the right of the task name you’ll see the number of files to be exported by each task, an estimated size (if it’s a wave file), and
a summary of the file format.

Editing tasks in the task queue
You can update tasks that you already added to a task queue. To update an existing task:
1. Do one of the following:

 Double-click on the task within the task list.

Using export filename tags and presets
You can use “tokens” to define filenames for exported audio files. Tokens allow you to use placeholder tags that automatically extract
the corresponding information (such as the project name, artist, sample rate, bit depth, current date or time, etc.) from a project and
adds it to the resulting filename.
For example, instead of manually typing the project name and date into the filename edit box, you can enter the following:
{projectname}_{d}
This will automatically use the project’s name and the current date. Each token is enclosed by curly brackets (aka braces), e.g. {d}.

Adding filename tags
To enter a tag, do one of the following:

 Click the Build File Name Using Tags button

to open the Tags panel, then click a tag. You can still type while this pop-up is
showing, so you can mix literal characters with tags, or use backspace to correct any mistakes.

 Type in the tags directly into the filename edit box. Be sure to enclose each token by curly brackets (aka braces), e.g. {d}.
Tokens are case sensitive.
Tip: Use separator characters like space, dash or underscore if you wish to visually separate the tags.

Note: Most tags have a long token and a short token. For example, the project name token can be {projectname} or {P}.
Each tag’s tooltip shows its full and abbreviated tokens. To always use abbreviated tokens when you click a tag, select Use
Abbreviated Tokens in the filename tags panel. You can freely use either format.

Preparing to create an Audio CD
You can create an audio CD from any wave file or files (extension .wav) of up to either 74 or 80 minutes (depending on the
recordable CD media you have). If your projects are audio only, you can simply mix down to a stereo wave file. If your projects
contain MIDI, you must first convert the MIDI tracks to audio tracks. Once you have all the stereo wave files you want to include on
your CD, you are ready to burn a CD. Use the Utilities > Burn Audio CD command to burn your tracks to an audio CD.
For step-by-step procedures:
“To export audio to Wave file format” on page 1141
“Converting MIDI to audio” on page 979

To burn audio tracks to an audio CD
1. Make sure the tracks you want to burn to CD have been saved as 16-bit, 44,100 Hz, stereo Wave (.wav) files.
2. Insert a blank CD-R disc in the destination drive.
3. Choose Utilities > Burn Audio CD to open the Audio CD Burner dialog box.
4. Select a destination CD writing drive using the Target Drive drop-down list.
5. Click Add Track to locate and import the audio Wave files you want to burn to CD.
6. Place the tracks in the desired order by using the Move Up and Move Down buttons.
7. Click Burn CD.
Cakewalk verifies, performs a layout of the tracks and writes the current track list to CD medium in the selected drive. After the disk
is completed, the disk is ejected from the drive.
See:
“Burning audio CDs” on page 1161
“Exporting audio” on page 1135
“Exporting” on page 1133

Burning audio CDs
Cakewalk has integrated Audio CD burning, which allows you to write your audio tracks to an audio CD that can be played in any
standard CD player.
The Utilities > Burn Audio CD command lets you burn your tracks to an audio CD that you can play in any standard CD player.
For more information about the Utilities > Burn Audio CD command, see “Audio CD Burner dialog” on page 1591.

Exporting MIDI
You can export the entire project as a Standard MIDI file, or export individual MIDI Groove clips.
Note: Only the MIDI portion of your projects is saved in a standard MIDI file. If your projects contain digital audio, the audio
portion of the project will be lost when you save it to a standard MIDI file.

Features not supported by MIDI files
While the MIDI file format is very flexible and extensive, it cannot store the following parameters that are part of a standard project
file:

 Articulations
 Key offset (Key+)
 Velocity offset (Vel+)
 Time offset (Time+)
 Forced channel
 Track state (all tracks are saved without mute, solo, or archive indicators)
When you save a project to a Standard MIDI file, most of these parameters are applied to the individual events. For instance, if you
have assigned track 1 to channel 10 in the Track view, Cakewalk will write the MIDI file so that every event on track 1 has a channel
number of 10. When you subsequently load the MIDI file all of those Track view parameters will have vanished. But the music will
sound the same, because Cakewalk has made these changes to the events themselves.

To export the current project as a Standard MIDI file
1. In the Track view, make a time selection to select the range that you want to export, or clear the selection (Edit > Select > None)
to export the entire project.
2. Choose File > Export > Standard MIDI File to open the Save Copy dialog box. The project must contain MIDI data to make the
command available.
3. Navigate to a folder where you store the MIDI clip.
4. Type a name for the clip in the File Name field.
5. Under Save as type, select the desired MIDI file format:

 MIDI Format 0. Standard MIDI File that has all channels merged into one track.
 MIDI Format 1. Standard MIDI File that keeps each channel on a separate track.
 Riff MIDI Format 0. Riff MIDI File of Format 0.
 Riff MIDI Format 1. Riff MIDI File of Format 1.
6. Click the Save button.

To export a single MIDI clip
1. Select the MIDI clip (see “MIDI Groove Clips” on page 813) that you want to export.
2. Go to File > Export > Standard MIDI File to open the Save Copy dialog box.
3. Navigate to a folder where you store the MIDI clip.
4. Type a name for the clip in the File Name field.
5. Click the Save button.
You can also drag a MIDI Groove clip from Cakewalk to the Windows Explorer or the Media Browser. For details, see “Exporting via
drag and drop” on page 1150.

Cakewalk exports the MIDI Groove clip, which contains the information displayed in the Clip Properties Inspector’s Groove Clip
section, except for the Pitch (semitones) field, which does not get exported.
You can also drag a MIDI Groove clip from Cakewalk to the Windows Explorer or the Media Browser. For details, see “Exporting via
drag and drop” on page 1150.
Note: You can not export MIDI Groove clips by saving your project as a Standard MIDI File, because Standard MIDI Files do not
contain MIDI Groove clip data, such as transposition value, etc.

Using Region FX

Cakewalk provides several ways to add effects to audio data. You can add plug-in effects to a track FX Racks to process the entire
track. You can also add plug-ins to clip FX Racks to only process individual clips. For even greater precision, you can apply special
processing to specific audio regions. These effects are called Region FX.
Any ARA-compatible VST3 audio plug-in will be available as a Region FX in Cakewalk, and will be listed in the Track view Region
FX menu. For details, see “ARA Audio Random Access” on page 1167.
When you apply a Region FX, Cakewalk converts the selected region to a new special Region FX clip. A Region FX appears right
before the clip FX Rack in the signal chain (see “Signal flow” on page 980).

To create a Region FX clip
1. Select an audio region or clip you wish to process with an ARA plug-in. To select a region on the timeline, use the Smart tool
or Select tool
and drag across the bottom part of the clip(s). To select an entire clip, simply click the clip. For details, see
“Selecting clips” on page 496.
2. In the Track view, click the Region FX menu, click the name of the desired ARA plug-in (for example, Melodyne), then select
Create Region FX.
The selected audio region is converted to a Region FX clip, and the plug-in interface appears in the MultiDock view.

Note: Although you can insert an ARA-compatible plug-in in a clip FX Rack, doing so will not provide all the ARA benefits of
using the plug-in as a Region FX.

ARA Audio Random Access
What is ARA?
ARA (Audio Random Access) is an extension of the VST plug-in interface, which allows ARA-compatible VST plug-ins to be closely
integrated in host programs like Cakewalk.
ARA is not a new competing plug-in format, but simply an optional extension to the VST format that has to be supported by both the
host program and plug-in. Cakewalk supports ARA via VST3 plug-ins.

What are the benefits of ARA?
The main benefit of ARA is the ability to integrate with plug-ins that can edit audio, such as Melodyne. ARA-compatible plug-ins have
random access to the audio data since they can also re-sequence the audio.
Without ARA, a normal plug-in only receives audio data from the host program in real-time during playback, and knows nothing
about the musical context of the audio data. This may be sufficient for some types of plug-ins like reverb and EQ, but not for plug-ins
that need to analyze the entire musical context (notes, rhythm, tempo, key, etc.) in order to produce optimal results. ARA greatly
improves the workflow when using certain types of plug-ins, such as pitch and timing correction.
With ARA, Cakewalk and compatible plug-ins can exchange information about the project’s timeline data, including audio clips,
tempo, pitch, rhythm and much more, which allows them to work together much more closely.
Cakewalk includes a 30-day trial version of Celemony Melodyne (see “Melodyne” on page 1168), which is ARA-compatible. You can
apply Melodyne to any selected audio region in Cakewalk, and use the Melodyne Editor directly in Cakewalk’s MultiDock view.
Melodyne essentially functions as an integrated feature in Cakewalk.
ARA is latency-free, and unlike regular VST effects, ARA effects such as Melodyne have full access to audio clips in Cakewalk.
For more information about ARA, see www.celemony.com/cms/index.php?id=ara.

To use an ARA plug-in
ARA-compatible VST3 plug-ins are listed in the Track view Region FX menu.
1. Select an audio region or clip you wish to process with an ARA plug-in. To select a region on the timeline, use the Smart tool
and drag across the bottom part of the clip(s). To select an entire clip, simply click the clip. For details, see
or Select tool
“Selecting clips” on page 496.
2. In the Track view, click the Region FX menu, click the name of the desired ARA plug-in (for example, Melodyne), then select
Create Region FX.
The selected audio region is converted to a Region FX clip, and the plug-in interface appears in the MultiDock view.

For more information about ARA, see www.celemony.com/cms/index.php?id=ara.

Melodyne
Melodyne is part of Celemony’s one-track product family, and offers basic editing of pitch and timing with the same high sound
quality as Celemony’s flagship version Melodyne Editor. With Melodyne, you can:

 Correct off-key vocals and out-of-tune melodic instruments.
 Create harmonies.
 Fix timing errors in melodic and rhythmic material.
 Convert audio to MIDI. Double an audio track on a MIDI instrument. You can even use vocal or other audio source as a MIDI input
device (sing/hum a melody, etc., and convert to MIDI). For details, see “To convert audio to MIDI” on page 1177.

Melodyne is integrated in Cakewalk via the ARA protocol (see “ARA Audio Random Access” on page 1167). The Melodyne interface
appears docked in Cakewalk’s MultiDock view.
After an audio clip has been converted to a Melodyne Region FX clip, you can make changes to the clip dynamically, just like any
regular audio clip.
You can move, copy, trim, mute, slip-stretch or delete clips, and Melodyne will automatically follow along. Melodyne also follows
tempo and time signature changes in your project, and you can position the Now Time and start/stop playback directly from inside
Melodyne.
With monophonic audio material, you can modify the pitch, position and duration of individual notes. You can also cut, copy, paste
and quantize notes.
When working with complex rhythmic or polyphonic audio material, Melodyne separates the notes into beats. Notes that occur on
the same beat can be edited as a group in the shape of a Melodyne “blob”.

The Region FX plug-in interface appears in the MultiDock view.

Melodyne algorithms and note detection
When you create a Melodyne Region FX clip, Melodyne analyses the audio data to determine the best algorithm to use for
displaying and playing back the audio. You can change the algorithm at any time from Melodyne’s Algorithm menu. In some cases,
you may want to change the algorithm if the audio material was not interpreted in a way that suits your editing needs. The options
are as follows:

 Melodic. Use for monophonic melodic material (only one note is ever sounding at any given instant). For best results, use a dry
audio source without reverb.

 Percussive. Use with rhythmic, atmospheric and noise-based material, or any other material in which Melodyne cannot detect
any clear pitch in the sounds.

 Polyphonic (Melodyne editor only). Use with single-instrument polyphonic material. In Melodyne assistant and essential,
polyphonic material is assigned to the Percussive algorithm.

Note: Polyphonic editing is only available in Melodyne editor with the patented DNA Direct Note Access technology. In
Melodyne assistant and essential, the algorithm for polyphonic material is present but disabled in the Algorithm menu. This is
because you can still open and play back projects that were created with Melodyne editor and contain polyphonic material, and
in such cases, Melodyne automatically selects the polyphonic algorithm. However, Melodyne assistant and Melodyne essential
do not allow you to edit polyphonic material, or select the polyphonic algorithm manually.

Manual editing vs. macros
There are two methods to edit notes in Melodyne:

 Main tool. Use the Main tool

to fine-tune individual notes. For details, see “To modify pitch and timing with the Main tool” on

page 1172.

 Macros. Use macros to automatically edit the selected notes. For details, see “To correct pitch automatically by macro” on page
1173 and “To correct timing automatically by macro” on page 1174.
You can even combine the two methods. For example, use the macros to quickly correct most pitch or timing problems, then finetune individual notes with the Main tool

.

To modify pitch and timing with the Main tool
Melodyne's Main tool
is similar to Cakewalk's Smart tool in that it is context-sensitive and has different functions depending upon
its position relative to a note.
Similar to a clip in Cakewalk, each note (or “blob”) in Melodyne has several hotspots that you can click to modify the blob. To display
these hotspots, select View > Show Blob Info in Melodyne. Melodyne now displays thin lines to identify the various hotspots when
you point to a blob. Each blob has a front, center, back, and upper hotspot. The mouse pointer indicates the function of each hotspot.

To make a Melodyne clip follow tempo changes in Cakewalk
Do one of the following:

 Select the Melodyne Region FX clip, then select Region FX > Melodyne > Follow Host Tempo on the Track view menu.
 Right-click the Melodyne Region FX clip and select Region FX > Melodyne > Follow Host Tempo on the pop-up menu.
The Melodyne Region FX clip will now obey any tempo changes in the project.
Note: You cannot slip-stretch a Melodyne Region FX clip when the Follow Host Tempo option is enabled.

To copy a Melodyne clip’s tempo map to Cakewalk’s tempo map
Melodyne features accurate tempo detection, and Cakewalk’s ARA integration allows you to easily synchronize a project’s tempo
map to the tempo of any Melodyne Region FX clip or regular audio clip.
When an audio clip is converted to a Melodyne Region FX clip, Melodyne detects any inconsistencies between the detected tempo
and the project tempo. If any inconsistencies are detected, Melodyne’s Tempo Options button will pulse.
Figure 516. The Melodyne Tempo Options button pulses if there are any tempo inconsistencies.

To add the tempo from a Melodyne Region FX clip to Cakewalk’s tempo map, do one of the following:

 Drag the Melodyne Region FX clip to Cakewalk’s Time Ruler.

Note: In addition to dragging a Melodyne Region FX clip to the Time Ruler, you can also drag any audio clip to the Time Ruler
and Cakewalk will extract the tempo information using Melodyne and ARA and set the global tempo map for that region. It is not
necessary to first convert the audio clip to a Melodyne Region FX clip, but this approach will not allow you to edit the tempo in
Melodyne before extracting the tempo. The only exclusions are Groove clips and REX files, since they already follow Cakewalk’s
tempo. If a clip has Lock Position enabled, hold down the CTRL key in order to drag it to the Time Ruler.

 Click the Tempo Options button in Melodyne, then select Use the tempo grid detected by Melodyne.

To convert audio to MIDI
Do one of the following:

 Simply drag the Melodyne Region FX clip to a MIDI or Instrument track.
 Select the Melodyne Region FX clip, then select Region FX > Melodyne > Copy MIDI Events on the Track view menu. You can
then paste the data to a MIDI or instrument track.

 Right-click the Melodyne Region FX clip and select Region FX > Melodyne > Copy MIDI Events on the pop-up menu. You can
then paste the data to a MIDI or instrument track.

 Drag an audio file from the Browser and drop it on a MIDI or Instrument track.
 Drag an audio clip to a MIDI or Instrument track.
If you change your mind while converting a long audio file, press the ESC key to cancel the operation.
There are many good use-cases for converting audio to MIDI, including:

 Replace or double an audio track with a MIDI or software instrument.
 Transcribe and analyze musical structure of audio data. You can even view the data as musical notation in the Staff view.
 Extract the groove of an audio track and create a Groove Quantize template that can be applied to MIDI tracks.
 Extract the beat information from an audio track and use the MIDI notes as a guide track for creating a tempo map in Cakewalk
(Process > Fit Improvisation).

 Use vocal or other audio source as a MIDI input device (sing/hum a melody, etc., and convert to MIDI).
Figure 517. Drag a Melodyne Region FX clip to a MIDI or Instrument track to convert it to a MIDI clip.

Note: Melodyne essential and Melodyne assistant only support monophonic audio data. If the audio source contains polyphonic
material, the resulting MIDI conversion will be monophonic. Polyphonic audio-to-MIDI conversion is only supported in Melodyne
editor.

Drum Replacer
Drum Replacer is a drum replacement tool that lets you replace or reinforce individual drum sounds in existing audio tracks. For
example, you can replace only the snare drum sound in a drum track, while leaving all other drum sounds intact.
This is a very useful tool if you are happy with a drum performance, but would like to change the sound of one or more drum
instruments.
Drum Replacer is a Region FX that can be applied to any audio selection. You can configure Drum Replacer to listen for individual
drums, such as kick, snare, hi-hat, etc. Drum Replacer analyzes an audio track based on the criteria you specify, then plays a predetermined sample of your choice when a corresponding drum hit is detected.
You can configure up to 3 different drum sounds to be replaced, each with its own set of settings.
Drum Replacer includes a library of replacement drum sounds, and you can also import your own sounds (.wav, .flac, .aif,
.aiff, .ogg, and multi-sample .sfz files). For details, see “To load a replacement sample” on page 1184.
Drum replacement works best when each drum instrument is isolated on a separate audio track (kick on one track, snare on another
track, etc.). However, by using Drum Replacer's advanced filters, it is also possible to replace drums in a mixed stereo drum track.
For details, see “To isolate a drum sound” on page 1185.
Figure 519. Drum Replacer.

Highlights:

 Up to 3 drum sounds can be replaced simultaneously.
 Graphical representation of threshold.
 Enable/disable triggers.
 Support for multi-velocity samples.
 Trigger soft synths by converting triggers to MIDI notes.

Drum Replacer editor
The Drum Replacer editor can be opened for any Drum Replacer Region FX clip. For details, see “To create a Drum Replacer
Region FX clip” on page 1183 and “To open the Drum Replacer editor” on page 1184.
The Drum Replacer editor provides an intuitive visual interface that lets your easily adjust the trigger controls.
The scrolling real-time waveform display shows trigger points, and reacts to the filter setting to show how Drum Replacer will react to
incoming audio.
The Threshold control is represented as a horizontal line that can be moved up or down. All audio transients above the line will
cause a trigger, while audio below the line is ignored. Incoming audio that is detected as a “hit” is displayed as an orange trigger
point.
You can configure up to 3 different drum sounds to be replaced, each with its own set of settings.

Drum Replacer includes the following controls:

 Scroll bar. Scroll the waveform display horizontally. The waveform scrolls automatically during playback.
 Dry/Wet. Control the mix between the original audio and the replaced samples. A setting of 100% (Wet) outputs only the
replaced audio, while a setting of 0% (Dry) outputs the original, unchanged audio only.

 Sample picker. Specify the replacement sample, which is the sound that is played by triggers. Select one of the default
samples, or load your own .wav, .flac, .aif, .aiff, .ogg, or multi-sample .sfz file.

 MIDI Note. Represents the MIDI note that will be created for each trigger if you drag the Drum Replacer Region FX clip to a
MIDI track. This allows you to trigger a soft synth instead of a sample.

 Sample waveform. Shows the waveform of the currently-loaded sample. You can load a new sample by dragging a .wav,
.flac, .aif, .aiff, .ogg, or .sfz file to the sample waveform display.

 Row enable/disable. Enable/disable the row.
 Filter. Use the filter to reduce microphone bleed from other instruments, and to isolate individual drums in a stereo mix. For
example a snare track might contain undesirable bass drum bleed. The filter lets you fine-tune the frequency range of interest,
making the desired drum easier for Drum Replacer to replace. The waveform display updates dynamically to reflect the filter
setting. As you adjust the Filter control, the filtered signal is soloed and different frequency ranges are graphically emphasized.
This is important in order to minimize erroneous triggers. The original unprocessed waveform is vaguely visible in the background
as a reference.
Note: The filter does not affect the samples being output; it only filters the incoming audio, making it easier to detect triggers.

 Interval. Specify how long Drum Replacer must wait before triggering a sample again. After a trigger, Drum Replacer will ignore
all audio for the duration of the Interval value, even if the audio is above the Threshold level. The valid range is 15-175
milliseconds. Experiment with the Interval value to get the best balance between accuracy and tracking speed:

 Reduce the value to respond to changes in dynamics faster (if Drum Replacer is missing quick flams and ghost notes, etc.),
but be careful not to pick up too much detail and falsely trigger.

 Increase the value to increase the triggering accuracy (if Drum Replacer is adding extra hits). Higher values are useful for
noisy tracks when it is difficult to set the Threshold level accurately.

 Threshold. Set the level the input signal must exceed in order to trigger the replacement sample. The horizontal line in the
waveform display represents the threshold value. The louder the audio, the higher the waveform is on the display. By default, any
transients above the horizontal line results in a trigger. Adjust the Threshold control so it is above the noise floor and below the
softest drum hit.

 Dynamics. Scale the dynamic range of all triggers. Drum Replacer automatically tracks the incoming drum hits and adjusts the
volume of the replacement samples according to the volume of the original hits. The valid range is 0-100%. The default value of
0% represents the trigger’s original velocity. Increase the value to add a more consistent feel to an overly dynamic performance.
With a value of 100%, the replacement sample is played at a constant volume, regardless of the original track’s dynamics.

 Trigger markers. Drum Replacer displays a trigger marker below each transient that is above the Threshold level. Each
automatically-detected trigger can be disabled or re-enabled by simply clicking the trigger marker.
You can also insert user triggers by clicking in the row below the detected triggers. To delete a user trigger, right-click the trigger.
To adjust a user trigger's velocity, drag it vertically. Detected trigger markers are orange while user markers are yellow.
Trigger markers serve as a helpful guide to determine if Drum Replacer is triggering on the desired hits, or if mis-hits are
occurring.
Triggers are color-coded as follows:

 = Automatically detected and ON.
 = Detected and OFF (disabled). Disabled triggers are half the height of enabled triggers.
 = Manually inserted.
 Waveform. The scrollable waveform display provides a visual indication of how the various controls interact with the incoming
audio signal. The waveform updates dynamically when you adjust the Filter control, and the horizontal Threshold line shows
which transients will result in a trigger.

 Pan. Adjust the sample’s left/right pan position in the stereo filed.
 Level. Adjust the output gain of the sample playback.

To open the Drum Replacer editor
To open the Drum Replacer editor, do one of the following:

 Double-click the Drum Replacer Region FX clip.
 Right-click the Drum Replacer Region FX clip, and select Region FX > Drum Replacer > Open Editor.
 Click the Region FX clip icon, and select Open Editor on the pop-up menu.
The Drum Replacer editor appears in the MultiDock view.

To load a replacement sample
Drum Replacer includes a library of replacement drum sounds, and you can also import your own sounds (.wav, .flac, .aif,
.aiff, .ogg, and multi-sample .sfz files).
By default, Drum Replacer loads one of its stock sounds. To change a row’s replacement sample, do one of the following:

 Click the Sample picker control and select a sample from the menu.
 Drag a .wav, .flac, .aif, .aiff, .ogg, or multi-sample .sfz file to the sample waveform display.
 Drag an audio selection from the Clip’s pane to the sample waveform display.

Tip: You can drag audio data from Cakewalk’s Clips pane to Drum Replacer’s sample waveform display. This is very useful if you want
to keep the original drum sound, but replace all hits with a specific “favorite” hit throughout the entire drum track. Perhaps some of the
kick drums are weak. Simply locate and select your preferred recorded kick drum hit in the Clip’s pane, then drag the selection to Drum
Replacer’s sample waveform display. All kick drum hits will now be replaced with the “favorite” hit.

To isolate a drum sound
Drum Replacer makes it easy to reduce microphone bleed from other instruments, and to isolate individual drums in a stereo mix.
The Filter, Threshold, and Interval controls let you fine-tune the trigger detection. Use the waveform display as a guide for finetuning the settings.
1. Open the Drum Replacer editor and press Play to begin playback.
Drum Replacer displays the waveform of the incoming audio. The louder the audio, the higher the waveform is on the display.
2. Decide which drum sound you want to replace. For example, the snare drum.
3. Adjust the Filter control to fine-tune the frequency range of the drum sound you want to replace.
4. Adjust the Threshold control (or drag the horizontal line) so it is above the noise floor and below the softest drum hit.
5. Adjust the Interval control, if needed. Reduce the value if Drum Replacer is missing quick flams or ghost notes. Increase the
value if Drum Replacer is adding extra hits.
Note: The filter does not affect the samples being output; it only filters the incoming audio, making it easier to detect triggers.

Editing triggers
Each transient that is above the threshold gets a trigger. Trigger markers are shown in a strip below the waveform display. To enable
or disable a trigger, simply click the trigger. Disabled triggers are half the height of enabled triggers.
There are two types of triggers: auto-detected triggers, and manual user triggers.
Triggers are color-coded as follows:

 = Automatically detected and ON.
 = Detected and OFF (disabled).
 = Manually inserted.
Detected triggers are shown in the top row, while user triggers are shown in the bottom row.

There are several ways you can edit triggers:

 To disable a detected trigger. Click the orange trigger.
 To disable multiple adjacent detected triggers. Right-click and drag across the triggers.
 To enable a disabled trigger. Click the short trigger.
 To insert a user trigger. Click in the row below the detected triggers. The minimum distance allowed between user triggers is
determined by the Interval control.

 To remove a user trigger. Right-click the yellow trigger.
 To remove multiple adjacent user triggers. Right-click and drag across the user triggers.
 To specify the velocity for a user trigger. Click the yellow user trigger and drag vertically. The current velocity value is shown
while dragging.

To scale trigger velocities
Drum Replacer automatically tracks the incoming drum hits and adjusts the volume of the replacement samples according to the
volume of the original hits. The Dynamics controls lets you scale the dynamic range of all triggers. The valid range is 0-100%. The
default value of 0% represents the trigger’s original velocity. Increase the value to add a more consistent feel to an overly dynamic
performance. With a value of 100%, the replacement sample is played at a constant volume, regardless of the original track’s
dynamics.

You can also adjust an individual user trigger's velocity. To do so, click the yellow trigger and drag vertically. The current velocity
value is shown while dragging.

To trigger a soft synth
You can convert triggers to MIDI note events in order to trigger a soft synth such as Session Drummer or Addictive Drums.
1. Insert the soft synth that you would like to trigger the replacement drum sound(s). For details, see “Inserting soft synths” on page
948.
2. In the Drum Replacer editor, assign each row to the desired MIDI Note number. The MIDI Note control is located above the
sample waveform of each row.

3. Drag the Drum Replacer Region FX clip to a MIDI track or Simple Instrument track.
The triggers are converted to MIDI Note events and a new MIDI clip appears in the MIDI track. Make sure the track is assigned
to the correct soft synth.

4. To avoid triggering both the replacement sample and soft synth, mute the original Drum Replacer Region FX clip or adjust the
Drum Replacer Dry/Wet control all the way to the left (0%).

VocalSync automatic audio alignment
VocalSync lets you automatically align the timing of audio data to a reference track. This is very useful if you want to replace or
double-track an existing vocal track, and synchronize the timing between the original and new tracks.
Figure 522. VocalSync.

The basic principle behind VocalSync is that you first specify a guide track that contains the correct timing, then you specify the dub
audio that you want to align with the guide track. VocalSync then applies varying amounts of time stretching or compression to adjust
the timing of the dub audio to match the timing of the guide track. You have full control over the alignment strength. Only the dub
audio is modified, and the pitch of aligned audio is unchanged. The guide track is an entire track, while the dub audio can be any
audio selection (a clip, a time selection, an entire track, etc.).
Although VocalSync is primarily intended for vocals, it can also produce good results with instruments and other audio sources.

Why use VocalSync?
Dubbing, or re-recording, is a process in which additional or supplementary recordings are mixed with, or replace, a previous
performance.
In a recording session, overdubbing typically starts with a guide track, and the performer attempts to overdub as closely as possible.
However, due to the nature of human performance, the result is normally not perfect.
To correct timing discrepancies between the guide track and dub, loop-recording problematic sections and manual editing is often
required. This can be both time-consuming and expensive.
With VocalSync, the artist can concentrate on their performance and not worry about perfectly matching the previous performance.
VocalSync can quickly adjust the timing to match the original guide track.
From lip-syncing to double-tracking, VocalSync helps you in creating performances with perfectly aligned overdubs, and reduces the
time that would otherwise be necessary to re-record dialogue or vocals.
VocalSync is suitable for various audio alignment tasks, including:

 Perfectly align double-tracked lead vocals, backing vocals, or melodic instrumental tracks.
 Re-groove recorded vocals for remixing.
 Tighten the ensemble of instrumental tracks that share an identical rhythmic performance.
 Synchronize a drum machine track to a live drum track (and vice versa).
 Lip-sync replacement dialogue in post-production for film and video.
 Change the voice, or even gender, of a vocal performance.

Note: Instruments with very different timbres may be problematic to align in certain cases.

1188

Using Region FX
VocalSync automatic audio alignment

How VocalSync works
VocalSync is a Region FX that lets you align the timing of a VocalSync Region FX clip (the dub) to any audio guide track.
Note: For best results, it is a requirement that the guide track and dub track performances are already time aligned as closely
as possible. You cannot have an arbitrary selection for the guide track.
When aligning two audio performances, VocalSync analyzes and compares the onsets and decays in the guide track and dub, then
applies varying amounts of time stretching or compression to the dub so it matches the guide track as closely as possible.
VocalSync uses a particular formula, or algorithm, to stretch the audio. It uses a processor-friendly algorithm for online previewing,
and a more processor-intensive algorithm for offline render.
The following figure illustrates two different recordings of the same phrase. The waveforms are similar, but the timing is slightly
different. The green and black lines are superimposed over the waveforms for illustration purposes only, but are not visible in
Cakewalk. Green lines represent onsets, and black lines represent decays.

Dub

Guide

Note: As with all audio alignment tools, VocalSync works best when the original audio (guide track) and overdub (dub audio)
are fairly similar to begin with. A performer should always attempt to align to the original audio as closely as possible during the
recording process. The closer the match, the better VocalSync can operate.

The VocalSync editor includes the following controls:

 Bypass. Bypass the VocalSync Region FX.
 Guide Track. Specify the guide track that contains the correct timing. This is the track the dub audio will be aligned to.
 Guide Strength. Modify the dub audio onsets and decays to match the guide track. As you increase the value of the Guide
Strength control, the dub audio will snap closer to the guide track.

 NF. Show/hide the Noise Filter Strength control.
 Noise Filter Strength. Control onset detection with noisy or sporadic audio material. This control may be helpful if your dub or
guide track has room noise and/or if the material was recorded in such a way that there is empty space between audio material
(i.e. vocal stabs a few measures apart). This is not an audio noise gate, rather it controls the number of onsets detected in a clip.
Typically lower adjustments give better results. For details, see “To adjust the noise filter strength” on page 1194.

 Render. Commit the VocalSync stretching and render the results to a new clip using the offline render mode. VocalSync uses a
particular formula, or algorithm, to stretch the audio. It uses a processor-friendly algorithm for online previewing, and a more
processor-intensive algorithm for offline render. For the best audio quality, render the VocalSync clip when you are happy with the
alignment between the dub and guide track.

 Close. Close the VocalSync editor.

Typical workflow
Before the alignment process can begin, you must specify the guide track, and the dub audio must be converted to a VocalSync
Region FX clip.
1. Determine which audio track you want to use as the timing guide track. To specify the guide track, do one of the following:

 Right-click the desired guide track and select Set as Default VocalSync Guide Track on the pop-up menu.
 In the VocalSync editor, select the desired guide track in the <Select Guide> drop-down list.
Note: For best results, it is a requirement that the guide track and dub track are already time aligned as closely as possible. You
cannot have an arbitrary selection for the guide track.

2. Select an audio region or clip you wish to process with VocalSync. To select a region on the timeline, use the Smart tool

or

Select tool
and drag across the bottom part of the clip(s). To select an entire clip, simply click the clip. For details, see
“Selecting clips” on page 496.
3. In the Track view, click the Region FX menu, point to VocalSync, then select Create Region FX.
The selected audio region is converted to a Region FX clip, and VocalSync makes an initial attempt at aligning the dub with the
guide track. The VocalSync editor appears next to the clip. If you close the VocalSync editor, you can open it again using one of
the following methods:

 Double-click the VocalSync Region FX clip.
 Right-click the VocalSync Region FX clip, and select Region FX > VocalSync > Open Editor.
 Click the Region FX clip icon, and select Open Editor on the pop-up menu.
The guide track audio waveform is shown superimposed over the bottom part of the VocalSync clip while the VocalSync editor is
open. This serves as a reference when you adjust the alignment strength.

If you do not want to see the hybrid dub/guide waveform, click the Track view View menu, point to Display, then clear the Display
VocalSync Hybrid Clips option. Regardless of the Display VocalSync Hybrid Clips setting, hybrid waveforms are always shown
when the VocalSync editor is open.

Note: Depending on the duration of the dub audio, the initial analysis can take a couple of seconds, after which real-time
adjustment of the Guide Strength control is possible.
4. In the VocalSync editor, adjust the Guide Strength control until you achieve the desired alignment.
As you adjust the Guide Strength control, VocalSync applies varying amounts of time stretching or compression to the dub
audio. The dub audio waveform in the top part of the clip moves in relation to the guide track waveform to represent the stretch
changes.
5. When you are happy with the results, click the Render button to commit the stretching to a new audio clip using the high-quality
offline render mode.

To choose render algorithms for an individual VocalSync clip
1. Select the VocalSync clip or clips you want to edit.
2. Press SHIFT+I to open the Clip Properties Inspector. The Clip Properties Inspector displays settings for the currently selected
clip(s).
3. In the Clip Properties Inspector, click the AudioSnap section’s header bar.
The AudioSnap section displays the current online and offline render modes of the selected clip. If you select multiple clips that
have different render modes, the Online Render and Offline Render lists display (Multi).
4. Select the desired Online Render or Offline Render mode. The options are as follows:

 Online Render. This choice determines what stretch algorithm is used during real-time playback. For more information
about render modes, see “Algorithms and rendering” on page 795. The options are as follows:
• Default. This mode uses the default Groove algorithm (the same algorithm used for stretching Groove Clip files). For
information about specifying the default online render mode, see “To specify default render modes for new VocalSync clips”
on page 1195.
• Groove. This mode works best with sustained vocal sounds, is faster than Percussion render mode, and uses less
processing power.
• Percussion.

This mode can work better than the Groove render mode for percussive vocals.

• Elastique Pro. Elastique Pro is a general purpose high quality time-stretching engine that fulfills the demands of
professional productions and broadcast applications. It minimizes stretching artifacts, offers stable timing, inter-channel
phase coherence and sample accurate stretching which allows for sharp transients and crystal clear vocals.
• Elastique Efficient. Elastique Efficient gives you similar time-stretching quality as Elastique Pro, but with a lower CPU hit.
The algorithm is targeted at complex polyphonic signals like complete mixes and offers the same transient preservation as
Elastique Pro.
Note: The Online Render mode is for preview purposes only during playback. The final audio quality will be greatly improved
after the Offline Render mode is applied during mixdown/export.

1194

Using Region FX
VocalSync automatic audio alignment

 Offline Render. This drop-down menu lets you choose the algorithm that is used when you export or freeze VocalSync
audio. Although the default Radius Solo (Vocal) algorithm is ideal for most voices, it’s worth experimenting with different
algorithms to find what works best with your voice. The options are as follows:
• Default. This uses Radius Solo (Vocal). For information about specifying the default offline render mode, see “To specify
default render modes for new VocalSync clips” on page 1195
• Radius Mix. Best for clips containing polyphonic, stereo data (although this type of source material isn’t commonly used
with VocalSync).
• Radius Mix Advanced. Similar to Radius Mix, but exposes Radius Pitch Coherence and Radius Phase Coherence
sliders in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording.
• Radius Solo.

Better for clips containing monophonic, solo instruments.

• Radius Solo (Bass). Better for clips containing solo bass instruments, but can also be a good choice for low voices.
• Radius Solo (Vocal).

Usually best for clips containing solo vocals in normal singing ranges.

• Elastique Pro. Elastique Pro is a general purpose high quality time-stretching engine that fulfills the demands of
professional productions and broadcast applications. It minimizes stretching artifacts, offers stable timing, inter-channel
phase coherence and sample accurate stretching which allows for sharp transients and crystal clear vocals.
• Elastique Efficient. Elastique Efficient gives you similar time-stretching quality as Elastique Pro, but with a lower CPU hit.
The algorithm is targeted at complex polyphonic signals like complete mixes and offers the same transient preservation as
Elastique Pro.
• Same as Online. Uses the same choice as the Online Render field.

To specify default render modes for new VocalSync clips
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording.
2. Under Stretch Methods, specify the VocalSync Online Render and Offline Render stretch methods.

Note: It is not recommended to set the online method to the expensive types since it may cause glitches.

Note: Changing the default render modes will only affect new VocalSync clips. Existing VocalSync clips will retain whatever the
default modes were when the VocalSync clips were originally created.
To apply new default render modes to existing VocalSync clips, first remove the Region FX, then create the VocalSync Region FX
again, then render the clips. Alternatively, assign the desired render modes for selected VocalSync clips directly from the Clip Properties
Inspector. For details, see “To choose render algorithms for an individual VocalSync clip” on page 1194.

V-Vocal Editor
V-Vocal is a vocal processor that does pitch correction on notes and phrases, corrects timing, edits formants and dynamics, and can
add vibrato.
The following topics describe using the V-Vocal interface to process audio data. For information about inserting and managing
V-Vocal in Cakewalk, see “V-Vocal Region FX clips” on page 1196.

Pitch editing
Pitch editing requires that the Pitch button in the Edit Mode section is enabled. Here’s a description of the interface in pitch editing
mode:

 The yellow line is the edited Pitch curve and this line is the actual sounding pitch.
 The red line is the original Pitch curve and this line cannot be edited.
 The green dot is a Node. Nodes are automatically assigned to the start and end of the edited region. You can select the specific
region between the nodes if you click the yellow line between the nodes.

 The white horizontal line is called Center Pitch. Center Pitch is used as a baseline for increasing or decreasing vibrato or for pitch
correction.

To change the pitch of a selected region
1. Use the Arrow tool to select the part of the yellow line that you want to transpose (make sure that the Pitch button in the Edit
Mode section is enabled).
The selected region turns blue to show that it is selected.
2. Drag the yellow line up or down.
Nodes appear automatically when you shift pitch.
Tips:

 CTRL-dragging snaps the pitch to the pitch correction grid. SHIFT dragging moves the pitch by 100 cent increments.
 You can also edit pitch by dragging a node up or down.
 You can undo each edit you do by pressing CTRL+Z. You can use this command repeatedly to undo multiple edits.
About pitch correction
The key for making manipulated sound more natural is using the parameters in the Pitch Correction section: Note, Vibrato and
Sense. Functions for each parameter are as follows:

 Note. Controls the ratio of pitch shifting to the nearest scale note. With a value of 100, each section is completely shifting to the
nearest scale note.

 Vibrato. As the value increases, the vibrato depth gets narrower. At a value of 100, Vibrato is completely eliminated.
 Sense. As the value increases, the range of affecting pitch correction gets wider.
If you set all of above parameters to a value of 100, you will get a “robot voice”-type sound.
Current default values are:

 Note: 100
 Vibrato: 50
 Sense: 100

1200

Using Region FX
V-Vocal Editor

This setup is a bit too artificial. If you want to make the sound more natural, we suggest the following setup:

 Note: 70-100; be careful of intonation.
 Vibrato: 0-20; try 0, if you'd like to keep the original.
 Sense: 20-30; adjust to fit the data.
The above suggestion is just one example. Different types of audio might require different settings.
In addition, try adjusting the Pitch Follow parameter in the Formant Control section as follows:

 Set the value close to 100 if you'd like to do subtle pitch correction.
 Set close to 0 if you'd like drastic rephrasing.
To draw freehand pitch changes
1. Click the Pen tool.
2. Draw a shape on the graph.

To draw straight line pitch changes
1. Click the Line tool.
2. Draw a line on the graph.

To correct pitch
1. Select the region you want to correct by using the Arrow tool.
2. Select the notes that you want the selected region to become by clicking notes on the Keyboard button. The selected notes
should be light blue. The deselected notes are dark blue. When you click the Correct button, the selected area conforms to the
light blue notes on the keyboard. You can also click the note names in the Select Pitch Correction field to select notes. Note
that light blue note names are selected, gray note names are not selected, and red note names are bypassed.
Note: To display different octaves, drag the vertical scroll bar that is at the right side of the graph up or down.

3. Set the amount of pitch correction you want by adjusting the Note knob. 100 cents is equal to a half-step. Between 70 and 100 is
a good place to start.
4. If the selected region has any unstable pitch areas such as portamento, you can adjust the Sense knob, which adjusts pitch
correction sensitivity. Pitch correction gets stronger if you increase the value. 30 is a good starting point. If the selection has
vibrato, try 0 to 30.
5. Click the Correct button. The pitch in the selected region moves to the target pitches (the light blue notes on the keyboard).

To conform pitches to a Scale
1. Use the Arrow tool to select the region where you want to correct pitches.
2. Click the Scale button so that it is enabled (light blue).
3. Click a Maj or Min button to select a major or minor scale, respectively.
4. Click a note on the Keyboard button to select the root note of the scale.
The notes of the scale you selected turn light blue on the Keyboard button.
5. Click the Correct button.
The selected area conforms to the light blue notes on the keyboard.

To restore original pitch
 Use the Eraser tool to drag over a region. The region you drag over returns to original pitch.
To add vibrato
1. Click the Vibrato/LFO tool.
2. Move the cursor to the place where you want the vibrato to start.
The cursor displays a vibrato icon when it is ready to add new vibrato:

See:
“V-Vocal pitch-to-MIDI” on page 1205.
“Editing time” on page 1202.

Editing time
To edit timing with V-Vocal, the Time button in the Edit Mode section must be enabled.

To edit time
1. Make sure the Time button is enabled.
2. Move the Arrow tool near the vertical center of the graph until the cursor changes to the double arrow, and click at each point
where you want to preserve the original timing. A vertical green line appears at each point that you click.
3. Now add new green lines between the existing ones.
4. Drag the new lines to the left or right to compress or expand each region.
Tips:

 Hold down the CTRL key while you move lines to move all the following lines by an equal amount.
 To erase lines, drag a region with the eraser. Timing reverts to its original condition in the areas where you erase lines.
See:
“Editing formants” on page 1203

1202

Using Region FX
V-Vocal Editor

Editing formants
A rough definition of formants is that they are vowel sounds. To edit formants with V-Vocal, the Formant button in the Edit Mode
section must be enabled.
Here’s a picture of the V-Vocal interface in formant mode:

The red line in the graph is the formant line. The red dots on the line are nodes.

To shift the formant of a region
1. Use the Arrow tool to select the region you want to shift.
2. Drag the red line in the region up or down.
When you drag the red line, nodes are automatically created at the start and end of the selected region. You can drag the nodes to
create different shapes.
Tips:

 Double-clicking the red line in a selected region adds nodes to the place where you click, and also to the start and end of the
selected region.

 You can do freehand editing with the Pen tool.
 You can add an LFO to a selected region by dragging the red line up or down with the Vibrato tool. Dragging left or right modifies
the LFO frequency.

 You can reset segments of the red line by dragging with the Eraser.
 You can increase or decrease the formant for the entire phrase by adjusting the Shift knob.
To link the Formant line to the Pitch line
 To increase or decrease the formant relative to pitch, adjust the Pitch Follow knob. You can view pitch at the same time as
formants by right-clicking the graph, and choosing Views > Pitch from the context menu.
See:
“Editing dynamics” on page 1204

Using Region FX
V-Vocal Editor

1203

Editing dynamics
The basic procedures for editing dynamics with V-Vocal are the same as for formant editing, except that dynamics are represented
by a yellow line, and you must have the Dynamics button enabled in the Edit Mode section.
See:
“Context menu” on page 1204

Context menu
If you right-click the graph, the V-Vocal context menu appears.
The menu has the following commands:

 Undo. Use this command to undo your last editing action. You can use this command repeatedly to undo a series of editing
actions, starting with the latest.

 Redo. Use this command to redo an editing action that was just canceled by an Undo command.
 Select All. Use this command to select the whole phrase. You can deselect a selection by clicking away from the waveform.
 View. Use this command and the options in its submenu to hide or show the phrase’s waveform (Wave option on submenu), the
pitch display (Pitch), the formant line (Formant), and the dynamics line (Dynamics).

 Group Node. Deletes nodes in the selected region.
 Pitch Detect Mode. Method for redetecting center pitch (the white horizontal line) of LFO or Vibrato. After you select the region
you want to redetect, choose from these options the following submenus.

 Standard 1. Generally, you do not need to select this option, because it is used to detect pitch as soon as you create a
V-Vocal Region FX clip. If you decide to use another method, but change your mind and want to use this method, you can
select this method to recreate the original data.

 Standard 2. This is a general pitch detection setting that often performs better on styles with deeper vibratos.
 Deep Vibrato. Special purpose pitch detection method for phrases that contain very deep vibratos; this detection method
tends to create longer center pitches, but may detect multiple notes as a single note.

 Precision. Special purpose pitch detection method for very high resolution pitch detection of phrases; this detection method
will create more accurate center pitches for styles containing fast variations of pitch. This method, however, may divide a
single vibrato section into multiple pitches.

 LFO Pen Type. Select the type of the waves of vibrato added by the Vibrato tool.

Automation

Cakewalk has a very sophisticated automation system that lets you record fader moves and parameter changes with a mouse or
control surface during playback in real time, or edit automation graphically offline.
Automation means to record the movement of a fader, knob, or other control so that the next time you play your project, that control
moves automatically. This allows you to dynamically change parameters over the course of a project’s timeline. Cakewalk allows you
to graphically automate much more than just volume and pan controls—you can automate individual controls, faders, and knobs that
control the main outs, individual tracks, buses, individual effects’ parameters (including some plug-in synths), and even individual
clips. Easy to use read and write controls are featured on each automatable component of Cakewalk.
You can also group several controls together and automate them all by recording only a single control’s movements. You can draw
freehand and geometric automation curves with the Freehand tool and Pattern tools. All automatable controls are in the Console
view and the Track view (including the Clips pane), however, you can also graphically automate MIDI controllers from the Piano Roll
view in addition to the Console and Track views. You can enable or disable all automation by clicking the Global Automation
Playback button

in the Control Bar’s Mix module. You can also enable or disable automation by track or by parameter using

the Automation Read button
on track strips, buses, FX Racks and soft synths. This is a handy way to turn off automation for a
particular section of parameters while mixing.
Below are some examples of when you may want to use automation:

 If you want a track to slowly fade in or out, automate the tracks Volume control.
 If a particular plug-in is only required during a specific section in a song, automate the plug-in’s Bypass parameter during the parts
of the track where the plug-in is not required.

 If you want a certain sound to pan across speakers at given points during a song, “record” the panning movements.

Automation methods
There are several ways to automate controls in the Track view, Track Inspector and Console view:

 Recording the movements of individual faders, knobs, or controls. Record parameter changes in real-time with a mouse or
control surface. This method includes any knob, slider, or control except the Solo, Arm, Phase, Interleave, Vol Trim, Bus
Enable, Pre/Post buttons, Bank, Patch, Channel, Key+, Time+, Input and Output.

 Drawing envelopes in the Clips pane for audio and/or MIDI data. Draw automation envelopes with the global tools. An
envelope is a graph of the change in level of a particular parameter over time. For details, see “Creating and editing automation
envelopes” on page 1222.

 Recording automation data from an external controller.
 Snapshots. Take an instantaneous snapshot of the current parameter settings. For details, see “Snapshots” on page 1235.
A common workflow is to first record automation in real-time, then use the global edit tools to graphically fine-tune the automation
envelope.

Automation write modes
There are three modes available when writing automation: Overwrite, Touch, and Latch. The following table describes each mode.
Mode

Description

Parameters affected

Overwrite

Overwrite mode overwrites any existing automation data for the currently
armed parameter while the transport is rolling, even if you don’t touch the
parameter. Any previous automation is erased. This mode is useful if you
want to set some parameters to their desired write positions before you
press Play.

Only the parameter currently shown
in the track’s Edit Filter.

Touch

Touch mode overwrites any existing automation data for the currently armed
parameter only when the parameter is moved with the mouse or a MIDI
controller. Automation writing stops when the parameter is released, and the
parameter returns to any previously automated position. This mode is useful
if you want to update a previous write pass, appending new automation data
only where desired. When using a touch-sensitive MIDI controller, new
automation data will only overwrite existing automation data when you
physically touch a control.

All automation data on the track.

Latch

Latch Mode is similar to Touch mode; new automation data overwrites
existing automation data when you move a control. However, when you
release the parameter, it will remain “latched” into its current position and
continue to overwrite any existing automation data until playback stops. This
mode is useful if you want to start writing automation only after a parameter
is moved. This mode is particularly useful for automating pan controls and
plug-in parameters when using a non-touch sensitive control surface
(because it does not revert to its previous position when you release a
control).

All automation data on the track.

Table 85.

Icon

Automation write modes

Note 1: When writing automation from control surfaces, Cakewalk uses whichever automation write mode is set on the track.

Note 2: All automation write modes obey the Auto Punch region. For details, see “Punch recording” on page 370.

To specify a track’s automation write mode
Select the track. Click the Show/Hide Track Properties button
at the top of the Inspector pane, or press CTRL+SHIFT+I. In
the Track Properties Inspector’s Automation section, click Write Mode and select Overwrite, Touch, or Latch. For details, see
“Automation section” on page 716.
Tip: You can use a Quick Group to assign multiple selected tracks to the same automation write mode. For details see “Quick Groups”
on page 1044.

Automation time base
You can specify what happens to existing automation envelopes when you change the project’s tempo. Automation can be locked to
absolute time or musical time. You specify the automation time base in the Track Properties Inspector’s Automation section. The
two Time Base options are as follows:

 Musical (M:B:T). If the track is set to the Musical time base, the automation’s M:B:T position stays constant, and its Absolute
position shifts.

Automation Read and Automation Write buttons
Cakewalk has buttons to enable/disable automation playback (the Automation Read buttons
Automation Write buttons

) and automation writing (the

) on the following modules:

 Tracks
 Buses
 Plug-in property pages
 Clip effects property pages (Automation Read button only)
In addition, Cakewalk has right-click commands to enable/disable automation playback and writing for individual parameters. The
Automation Read/Write buttons enable or disable automation playback and recording respectively on all the parameters on an
individual track, bus, or plug-in at once. The Automation Read/Write commands enable or disable automation playback and writing
respectively on individual parameters of tracks, buses, or plug-ins.
The Automation Read button enables playback of automation envelopes for all automatable parameters in the track, bus, or plug-in
that the button is on, and is a handy way to temporarily turn off envelopes for a particular track or bus while mixing.
The Automation Write button

enables all automatable parameters on a specific audio track, bus, or plug-in to be recorded.

The Automation Read and the Automation Write buttons are located by default next to the Mute/Solo/Arm buttons on track and
bus strips in the Track View, on the console strip in the Console View, and below the Mute and Solo buttons in the Synth Rack. They
are also available in Cakewalk Soft Synth and Cakewalk effects plug-ins. Automation Read and Automation Write buttons have
three states; enabled, disabled, and dim. Enabled buttons indicate that all associated parameters are read/write enabled. A dim
button indicates that some parameters in the track strip or plug-in are read or write enabled, while others are not. During automation
writing, you will see the automation preview envelope being drawn in real time alongside the normal waveform or MIDI preview.

Enabling individual parameters
You can read-enable or write-enable individual parameters on tracks and buses by right-clicking them and choosing Automation
Read Enable or Automation Write Enable from the pop-up menu.
If you right-click an effect in an FX Rack, the Read Enable Parameter and Write Enable Parameter menu choices open dialogs
that allow you to select which parameters you want to enable.

Recording individual fader or knob movements
Recording automation for knobs and faders works in the Track view, the Console view, and Synth Rack. You can record automation
during both playback and recording operations.

To record individual fader or knob movements
1. Do one of the following:

 To write-enable an individual track or bus control, right-click the fader or control you want to automate and choose
Automation Write Enable from the pop-up menu.

 To write-enable individual plug-in parameters, right-click the name of the plug-in in the FX Rack, and choose Write Enable
Parameter from the pop-up menu. This opens a dialog box that allows you to choose which parameters to write-enable.

 To write-enable individual synth parameters, right-click the synth’s Automation Write button in the Synth Rack, and choose
Write Enable Parameter from the pop-up menu. This opens a dialog box that allows you to choose which parameters to
write-enable.

 To write-enable all parameters in an audio track, bus, synth, or effect, enable the Automation Write button

on the track,
bus, Synth Rack strip, or plug-in property page you are recording automation for. Enabling the Automation Write button on a
track or bus also write-enables all parameters of any effects on the track or bus.

2. Start playback or recording.
3. Move the armed parameter control(s).
4. Stop playback or recording.
After you record the automation data, Cakewalk draws a graph of it (an envelope) in the Clips pane, which you can edit with the
mouse by adding and dragging nodes (see the rest of this chapter). Once you record automation data in a track, the widget that you
automated displays an indicator to show that automation has been applied. You can also group controls, so that automating one
control automates all the controls in the group.

Automation lanes
Automation lanes are an alternative method of viewing automation envelopes on tracks and buses. Automation envelopes can be
displayed in the parent track, or in indented lanes below the parent track.
Figure 529. Automation lanes.

A

B

A. Parent track B. Automation lanes

While the parent track can show multiple clips and automation envelopes simultaneously, each Automation lane displays only a
single automation envelope. Automation lanes allow you to easily show only the parameters you are interested in, without cluttering
up the interface with numerous automation envelopes.
Automation lanes can be expanded or collapsed. When expanded, Automation lanes are indented below the parent track/bus.
Automation lanes can be created, hidden, and removed. Each track/bus can have an unlimited number of lanes.
Automation lanes provide many benefits, including:

 Better visibility of automation data.
 Less screen clutter on track strips.
 Choose to only show the data you’re interested in.
 Easier to work with individual automation envelopes.
 Easy to copy and paste specific automation data.
 Ability to quickly bypass individual automation parameters.
 Slider to control automation parameters.
To show a track’s Automation lanes, click the track’s Expand/collapse Automation lanes button

.

Use an Automation lane’s Edit Filter control to specify the automation parameter you want to edit.
The selected global tool operates on track automation envelopes that are assigned to lanes, including ProChannel, Arpeggiator,
plug-in parameters and MIDI continuous controllers (CCs).
Figure 530. You can expand and collapse Automation lanes for each track and bus.

Creating and editing automation envelopes
You can create automation envelopes for tracks, buses, clips and plug-ins. Drawing an envelope overwrites any preexisting
envelope for the same parameter that occurs at the same time in the same track or bus.
To edit automation envelopes, first select the automation parameter from a track’s Edit Filter control (see “Selecting the data type to
edit” on page 572), and use the global tools in the Control Bar’s Tools module (see “Tools” on page 565) to edit the envelope.
If a time selection spans multiple tracks, the global envelope editing tools affect all selected tracks.
Figure 534. Edit Filter control.

To control track automation, click a track’s Edit Filter control, point to Track Automation and choose the desired track parameter on
the submenu menu. To control clip automation, point to Clip Automation and choose the desired clip parameter on the submenu.
The Edit Filter menu uses bold text to indicate already created envelopes. For more information about using the Edit Filter, see
“Selecting the data type to edit” on page 572.
Tip: You can quickly toggle between Track Volume and the last/previously shown data type on the current track. To do so, press the
= key. This only works on the current parent track, not in Automation lanes. To toggle between Clip Gain and the last/previously shown
data type on the current track, press SHIFT+=.
To toggle between the two most recent Edit Filter settings, hold down the SHIFT key and right-click in the Clips pane.

To insert a new automation envelope
In the Track view, click the track’s Edit Filter control and select the desired parameter on the pop-up menu.
The envelope appears in the Clips pane as a straight, dotted line in the envelope’s individual color, with a node (very small circle) at
the beginning. When you move the cursor over the envelope, a vertical, double-ended arrow appears under it with the name and
current value of the envelope in a box next to the cursor. The envelope’s vertical position reflects the current value of the parameter
you are editing.
Note: The dotted line in an envelope shows two things:
• There is no automation data at the time in a track where the dotted line is.
• The value of the last piece of automation data that exists before the dotted line is represented by the vertical level of the
dotted line.
You can move an automated control while your project plays, and if you move it during a time where that control has a dotted line in
its envelope, the control will stay where you move it. As soon as the Now time reaches a node or solid line, the control snaps to the
value of the node or solid line.

1. Set the track’s Edit Filter control to the desired automation parameter (Track Automation or Clip Automation).
2. Select the desired pattern tool: Sine Pattern tool
or Random Pattern tool

, Triangle Pattern tool

, Square Pattern tool

, Saw Pattern tool

,

.

3. Set the Snap to Grid to the desired length of each cycle of the shape you want to draw. For example, if you want to draw sine
curves, and you want each complete sine curve to last one beat, set the Snap to Grid to a value of Quarter. If the Snap to Grid is
disabled, the default cycle is one measure.
4. Click and hold the mouse button in the Clips pane at the place where you want to draw the envelope shape. The place where you
click also sets the vertical midpoint of the shape.
5. Drag up or down to set the vertical range of the envelope, then drag to the right or left to set the length of your edit. As you drag,
the cursor’s vertical distance from the midpoint (the point where you originally clicked) determines the amplitude of the shape. To
create a series of identical shapes, hold the SHIFT key down while you drag. To gradually increase or decrease the amplitude,
gradually move the pointer farther from or closer to the midpoint.
6. Release the mouse button when done. The shape you selected appears, repeating according to the Snap to Grid setting.
Tip:
• To halve the cycle frequency (for example, if snap resolution = quarter note, make each cycle a half note), hold down the
ALT key while you draw.
• To double the cycle frequency (for example, if snap resolution = quarter note, make each cycle an eighth note), hold down
the CTRL key while you draw.
• To invert the phase of the pattern, drag the cursor below the zero-line/center (where you initially clicked to start the pattern).

Automating track mute
The Mute buttons in the Track view, Track Inspector and Console view work in two ways:

 You can record or draw automation for each Mute button, and the automation data controls the buttons.
 You can click a Mute button while playback is in progress and manually override any automation data for that button.
A track’s Mute button can display the muted or unmuted status of either the automation envelope or of manual muting. To toggle
between showing a track’s manual mute status or automated mute status, right-click the track’s Mute button and choose Switch to
Automated Mute or Switch to Manual Mute on the pop-up menu. When the command is disabled, the track’s Mute button shows
whether you have depressed the Mute button manually or not (the manual mute status). When the command is enabled, the Mute
button displays a fader next to the M:

.

To draw a Mute envelope
1. Click the track’s Edit Filter control, point to Track Automation and choose Automated Mute on the submenu.
An envelope appears at the bottom of the track.
2. Add nodes to the envelope and edit it so that the envelope is more than 50% of its maximum height wherever you want the track
muted.

To record a Mute button’s movement
1. Right-click the Mute button you want to automate and choose Switch to Automated Mute from the pop-up menu.
2. Make sure the Mute button or its whole track is write-enabled.
3. Start playback or recording, and click the Mute button on and off where appropriate.
4. Click the Stop button press the SPACEBAR when the track has been muted in the appropriate places.
Cakewalk draws an automated mute envelope in the track you recorded on. Before you listen to your track, make sure the Global
Automation Playback button

is enabled in the Control Bar’s Mix module.

Envelope mode and Offset mode
There are two modes which control how your volume faders, pan faders, bus send faders, and bus send pan faders behave during
playback. The two modes are Envelope mode and Offset mode.
Envelope mode. In envelope mode, volume and pan faders follow the project’s automation and do not respond to changes you
make in real-time.
Offset mode. In Offset mode, you “offset” the current automation in a track using a parameter’s controls. For example, if a pan
envelope is set to hard left (100% left) and you adjust the pan in offset mode to 100% right, then the pan parameter is now set to
hard right. Setting the pan in offset mode to 50% right would set the pan to the center.
Note: Any position that you set a fader to in Offset mode remains in effect when you switch back to Envelope mode. For
example, if you set a volume fader to -INF while in Offset mode, switch to Envelope mode and drag the fader to its maximum
level, you will not hear anything.

To enable/disable Offset mode
 Click the Offset mode button

in the Control Bar’s Mix module.

In Offset mode, all controls that can be offset appear with a plus sign. For example Vol+.
The following audio controls support both Envelope and Offset modes:

Control

Automation
Creating and editing automation envelopes

To open non-Cakewalk envelope display on a percentage scale
You can globally configure the placement of 0 dB for your envelopes in the Clips pane. The default placement in the Clips pane of 0
dB is roughly 1/3 from the top of the clip. You can change the position of 0 dB in all envelopes to the middle of the clip.
There are several advantages when using the Envelope Display on a Percentage Scale option:

 It makes it easier to tell if there have been any changes.
 There is a finer resolution around 0 dB.
Note: In Envelope mode, newly created volume clips appear at the same dB value as the current Vol setting. For example, if
the Vol setting is +3 dB, a newly created volume envelope appears above the middle of the clip.

To display envelopes on a percentage scale
 Go to Edit > Preferences > Customization - Display and select the Display Envelopes on Percentage Scale check box.

Converting MIDI controllers to envelopes
MIDI controllers you edit in the Piano Roll view and MIDI envelopes you create in the Track view Clips pane are actually separate
data, even if they control the same parameter. Both kinds of envelopes are visible in the Clips pane, and should generally not be
used to control the same parameter. You can convert Piano Roll view envelopes to Track view envelopes by selecting the time range
and tracks that the Piano Roll envelopes occupy, and using Track view Clips > Convert MIDI Controllers To Envelopes command.

To convert MIDI controllers to envelopes
1. In the Clips pane, select the time range and track(s) that contain the controller data you want to convert.
2. In the Track view menu, select Clips > Convert MIDI Controllers to Envelopes.
The Convert MIDI To Shapes dialog box appears.
3. In the Type field, select the type of controller you want to convert.
4. In the Value field, select the controller number of the controller you want to convert. For example, if you’re converting a volume
envelope to a shape, select 7.
5. In the Channel field, select the channel of the controller you want to convert, and click OK.
Cakewalk converts the Piano Roll view controller envelope you selected to a Track view shape that controls the same parameter.
Note: If two clips overlap, the Clips > Convert MIDI Controllers to Envelopes command converts the controller envelopes in
both clips, in whatever parts of the clips lie in the selected time range.

Automation
Creating and editing automation envelopes

Snapshots
A snapshot is a setting or group of settings that Cakewalk’s controls snap to when your project reaches a certain Now Time. You set
all the controls to the values you want, and then create a snapshot of these settings at a particular Now Time. This approach is
useful, for example, when your project contains a variety of distinct sections and you want to make a sudden change in one or more
settings between the sections.

To create a snapshot of a track or bus parameter
1. Move the parameter control to where you want it.
2. Move the Now Time to the location where you want to create the snapshot.
3. Right-click the control and choose Automation Snapshot in the pop-up menu. You don’t have to write-enable the track or bus
module.
An indicator will appear on the control to show that automation has been added, and a node will be added to the control's
envelope on the track.
4. Make sure the appropriate Automation Read button is enabled, play your project and listen to the results. You can undo the
snapshot by using the Undo command, or by taking another snapshot at the same Now Time.

Successive snapshots do not update envelope node values
When taking multiple automation snapshots at the same Now time, new envelope nodes are created instead of updating any existing
envelope nodes. To address this issue, undo the previous automation snapshot before performing a new snapshot.

Automating effects
Cakewalk allows you to automate plug-ins, giving you real-time control over dozens of effects parameters.
See also:
“Recording individual fader or knob movements” on page 1214
“Using control groups” on page 1042

Note: When using automatable effects, the CPU meter may fluctuate rapidly within a few percentage points. This is normal
behavior.

Automating individual effects parameters
You can automate the parameters of some of Cakewalk’s effects by drawing envelopes, or recording fader movements, or creating
snapshots. You enable all automatable parameters in an effect when you enable the Automation Write button in an effect property
page.
To record fader movements, see “Recording individual fader or knob movements” on page 1214.

To draw envelopes for an individual effect’s parameters
1. Patch an automatable effect into the track or bus where you want to use it, and close the effect’s dialog box when it appears.
2. Click the track’s Edit Filter, point to Automation > (name of the effect you patched), and select the desired effect automation
parameter. Created envelopes are displayed in bold text at the top of the menu.
3. Use the global tools to edit automation envelopes. For details see “Tools” on page 565.

Recording automation data from an external controller
You can record automation data from an external controller or a MIDI keyboard.

To record automation data from an external controller
1. In either the Track view or Console view, right-click the control or knob that you want to control externally, and choose Remote
Control from the pop-up menu.
The Remote Control dialog box appears.
2. If your controller sends standard MIDI messages, RPNs, or NRPNs, choose a controller (such as Wheel) with which to control
your knob or control (see “Remote Control dialog” on page 1742 for more information). Also choose the MIDI channel your
controller will be sending the automation data on (it doesn’t have to be the same channel that the knob or control’s track plays
back on), and click OK.
3. If your controller works by sending Sysx information instead, choose options in the Sysx fields (see “Remote Control dialog” on
page 1742 for more information), and click OK.
4. In either the Track or Console view, write enable the knob or control for automation that you just configured for remote control.
5. Start playback or recording, and move the slider or wheel that you selected on your external controller.
6. When you finish recording the automation, click the Stop button or press the SPACEBAR.
Listen to your project and either re-record the automation, or disable each armed control by clicking the Clear All Automation Write
Enables button
in the Control Bar’s Mix module. You can disable remote control by right-clicking the relevant knob or fader and
choosing Disable Remote Control from the pop-up menu.
Tip: When recording automation from a non touch-sensitive control surface, it is recommended that you use Latch or Overwrite mode.

Note: When writing automation from a control surface, Cakewalk uses whichever automation write mode is set on the track.

Cakewalk offers a lot of flexibility in the way you can arrange windows on your screen. This allows you to adjust the viewing and
editing space to suit your own needs. The following options are just some of the ways you can arrange windows:

 Dock the Control Bar, Inspector and Browser to one of Cakewalk’s edges. For details, see “Docking windows” on page 1240.
 Dock windows in the MultiDock. You can have as many views open in tabbed format as you want. Instead of placing each view in
its own window, you can group views by docking them in the MultiDock. For details, see “MultiDock” on page 1243.

 Float views and move them outside of the confines of Cakewalk. This is particularly useful if you take advantage of Cakewalk’s
dual monitor support. For details, see “Floating views and using dual video monitors” on page 1246.

 Open multiple instances of the same view type. For details, see “Locking views” on page 1247.
 Save window layouts as screenset presets and freely switch between screensets at any time. For details, see “Screensets” on
page 1250.

 Tile projects and windows. For details, see “Tiling windows” on page 1248.
 Instantly make the current view or plug-in transparent so you can easily access other windows that may be hidden behind the
current window. The X-Ray Windows feature eliminates the need to constantly minimize, move, or close windows in order to work
in other windows. For details, see “X-Ray” on page 1254.

 Drag window frames to resize windows.
 Zoom in/out. For details, see “Zoom controls” on page 264.
 View Cakewalk in full screen mode. To do so, click the Window menu and choose Full Screen, or press F11.

MultiDock
The MultiDock is a container that can host one or more views. The MultiDock allows you to have frequently-used windows open in a
centralized location, without obscuring the Track view. Instead of placing each view in its own window, you can group views by
docking them in the MultiDock. In the MultiDock, each docked window is in its own tab with its own close button.
The MultiDock appears automatically when you dock a view below the Track view. By default, new editing views are arranged on
tabbed panes in the MultiDock.
Figure 540. You can dock multiple windows in the MultiDock.

The MultiDock is only visible when at least one view is docked there. By default, the MultiDock is displayed at the bottom of the
screen, below the Track view, but you can also float the MultiDock and even position it on a second video monitor. You can also
maximize the MultiDock to do detailed work in a docked window, or drag the splitter bar at the top of the MultiDock to enlarge the
tabbed view area.
When you drag a window towards the bottom of the Track view, a colored rectangle indicates that the window will be docked in the
MultiDock when you release the mouse button.
Figure 542. When you drag a window onto the MultiDock, a colored rectangle indicates that it is a valid drop location.

Floating views and using dual video monitors
When a view is float enabled, you can move it outside of the confines of Cakewalk. This is particularly useful if you take advantage
of Cakewalk’s dual monitor support, which allows you to float most of your views to a second monitor and increase the number of
views that you can have open at one time.
Important: Dual monitor support requires that you have a supported video card. Follow your hardware manufacturer’s
instructions for using dual monitors.
You can float views in Cakewalk without having a second monitor. Floating a view allows you to move it out of Cakewalk, over the
Control Bar and menus, for example, giving you added flexibility when using Cakewalk with other applications. All views except the
Track view can be floated.
Note: If you are using a dual monitor system and experience sluggish performance when selecting and dragging clips in the
Clips pane, confirm that both monitors are set to the same Color Quality bit depth.
By default, new views are docked in the MultiDock. Any view can be undocked from the MultiDock and moved anywhere on the
desktop. To float a docked view, simply drag the view’s tab out of the MultiDock.

To float a view
1. Open the view you want to float.
2. Click the view’s icon located in the upper left corner of the view and choose Enable Floating.

3. Move the view wherever you want.

Floating views and using dual video monitors

Locking views
By default, Cakewalk allows only one instance of each view, but you can lock the contents of most views, preserving the current view
by forcing a new instance of the view to appear if necessary. Locking views is the only way you can have multiple instances of the
same view open. Only the Track and Console views cannot be locked.

To lock/unlock a view
Do one of the following:

 Click the upper left corner of a window, and choose Lock Contents from the pop-up menu.
 If the view is docked in the MultiDock, right-click the view’s tab and choose Lock Contents.
Tip: A view can be locked automatically by pressing the CTRL key when opening the view.

Recycle plug-in windows
By default, Cakewalk recycles the currently-open plug-in window when you open a new plug-in UI, and all previously open plug-in
windows are closed. This prevents Cakewalk from being filled with numerous open plug-in windows, and you don’t have to manually
close plug-in windows that are no longer needed.
If you prefer to always open a separate window for each plug-in, go to Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings and clear the
Recycle Plug-In Windows check box.
To toggle the current behavior, hold down the CTRL key when you open a plug-in UI.
To pin a plug-in window so it remains on screen when subsequent plug-ins are opened, click the window’s Pin Plug-In Window
button

.

Pinning windows is the only way you can have multiple plug-in windows open simultaneously.

Note: Plug-in window recycling is disabled when loading projects, which ensures that projects open with all previously open
windows.

Screensets
A screenset is a snapshot of the current layout of various views and windows in a project, including which windows are open, their
size, position, zoom level and whether they are docked or floating. You can create up to 10 screensets per project and freely switch
between screensets at any time.
Figure 548. Screensets allow you to instantly switch between different window layouts.

Screenset 1

Screenset 2

Screenset 3...

One of the 10 available screensets is always active. There is no need to explicitly save screensets; Cakewalk does that
automatically for you, allowing you to focus on your work. The current window layout is always stored as the current screenset.
Cakewalk automatically saves the current screenset when you save the project or switch to another screenset. This allows
screensets to seamlessly integrate into any workflow. You can also lock screensets in order to prevent any further changes.
When you open a project, Cakewalk automatically restores the project’s last used screenset.
Screensets make it very efficient to arrange views and windows in Cakewalk. For example, you may prefer to use a particular
window layout while recording, a different layout when working with loops, and a different layout while mixing, etc. By creating
custom screensets, you can quickly change the window layout depending on the current workflow. When you select a screenset,
Cakewalk automatically restores the window layout that is stored in the screenset, so there is no need to manually close or open
windows.
Screensets can be selected and edited from the Screenset module in the Control Bar, or with number keys 1-0 on your computer
keyboard.
Screensets are saved per project, and you can import screensets from other projects. Screensets can be updated, renamed,
duplicated and locked to prevent further changes.
By default, Cakewalk has 10 custom window layouts assigned to screensets 1-10, but you can update and rename the default
screensets to suit your own work style.

X-Ray
The X-Ray Windows feature eliminates the need to constantly minimize, move, or close windows in order to work in other windows.
It works by decreasing the opacity of the current window enough so that you can see and work with the window that’s behind the
current window. You activate the feature by pressing SHIFT+X when the mouse cursor is over a window you want to x-ray. You can
choose to X-Ray whichever window is underneath the mouse cursor, or automatically X-Ray all FX/synth property pages in one step.
Note: The mouse cursor does not need to be over any plug-in property pages.

The X-Ray Windows feature works on the following windows:

 Piano Roll view (when float-enabled)
 Plug-in effects and synths
 Controller/Surface plug-ins
To select key bindings for X-Ray windows
1. Use the Edit > Preferences command to open the Preferences dialog box, then select Keyboard Shortcuts.
2. If you want to use currently unassigned keys or key combinations, scroll through the options in the Key window until the
Assigned to field that is just under the window reads Unassigned. It’s a good idea to find two unassigned options that are next
to each other or easy to remember.
Note: For best results with X-Ray Windows, avoid using ALT key combinations.

3. Once you have decided on two keys or key combinations that you want to use, select Global Bindings in the Area field, and
scroll to the bottom of the list of commands that are in the window below that field.
4. In the Key window, highlight the key or key combination that you want to use for the X-Ray command, then highlight X-Ray in the
function column of the list of commands, then click the Bind button to bind them together.
5. Now highlight the key or key combination that you want to use for the X-Ray All FX/Synths command, then highlight X-Ray All
FX/Synths in the function column of the list of commands, then click the Bind button to bind them together.
6. Click OK to close the dialog box.
To use X-Ray windows
1. Use the Edit > Preferences command to open the Preferences dialog box, click Customization - Display and make sure the
Enable X-Ray check box is selected.
2. Make sure that the view windows you want to X-Ray are in the Floating-enabled state. To check this, click the view or fx icon
that’s in the upper left corner of a window, and select Enable Floating from the drop-down menu. If Disable Floating is in the
menu, then the Floating option is already enabled.
Note: All FX/Synth/Control surface property pages are float-enabled by default.

3. To X-Ray or un-X-Ray a single window, move the mouse cursor over the window, and press SHIFT+X for the X-Ray command.
The window does not need to be the highlighted window.
4. To X-Ray or un-X-Ray all plug-in windows at once, press the key binding for the X-Ray All FX/Synths command.
Note: If a window has focus, and the window’s Give All Keystrokes To Plug-in button
commands won’t work.

To Adjust X-Ray Windows Options
1. Use the Edit > Preferences command to open the Preferences dialog box, then click Customization - Display.
2. On the General tab, you can adjust these options:

 Enable X-Ray. Enable or disable this check box to turn the X-Ray Windows feature on or off.
 Opacity. Adjust this value by typing in a value, or by clicking and holding the + or - button to adjust the final opacity
percentage value that an X-Rayed window reaches.

 Fade Out Time. Adjust this value by typing in a value, or by clicking and holding the + or - button to adjust the amount of
time that an X-Rayed window takes to reach its final opacity percentage value.

 Fade In Time. Adjust this value by clicking and holding the + or - button to adjust the amount of time that an X-Rayed
window takes to restore its original opacity.
3. Click OK to close the dialog box and accept your changes.
To exclude a plug-in from X-Ray capability
Very few plug-ins use DirectDraw to create their windows. These windows appear jittery when x-rayed.
To exclude a plug-in from X-Ray capability, follow these steps:
1. Use the Utilities > Cakewalk Plug- in Manager command to open the Cakewalk Plug-in Manager.
2. In the Plug-in Categories window, select the plug-in category to exclude.
3. In the Registered Plug-ins window, select the plug-in to exclude.
4. If the plug-in is a DirectX effect or an MFX, write down (or select and copy) the CLSID value that’s in the CLSID field at the
bottom of the dialog box.
If VST or VSTi, write down the VST ID value that’s in the VST ID field at the bottom of the dialog box.
5. Close the Plug-in Manager dialog box.
6. Open the Xrayexclude.ini file that’s in your Cakewalk program folder (use Notepad).
7. At the end of the file, find the [EffectProps View] section.
You will see entries such as the following:
; Waves SSL EQ Stereo
XRayExclude11=1397510483
XRayExclude12={E451379E-F7E1-4E82-98D9-BEB87AC45E90}
8. Exclude your plug-in by creating a blank line below the last entry in the [EffectProps View] section, and then typing:
;[name of your plug-in, but without brackets]
XRayExclude[type the next available number in XRayExclude list, but without brackets]=[VST ID number, with no brackets, or
CLSID number, with curly brackets at start and finish]
For example, if the last entry in the [EffectProps View] section was:
; Waves SSL EQ Stereo
XRayExclude11=1397510483
XRayExclude12={E451379E-F7E1-4E82-98D9-BEB87AC45E90}
If you want to exclude the Sonitus:fx Delay from the X-Ray Windows feature, after creating a blank line, type:
; Sonitus:fx Delay
XRayExclude13={C54E2D80-F9CA-11D2-8C30-00805FE9FC03}
If there was also a VST version of the Sonitus:fx Delay, you would add another line:
XRayExclude14=[some VST ID number, with no brackets]
9. Save and close the Xrayexclude.ini file, and restart Cakewalk to implement your changes.

Templates and key bindings

A template is a special file that is used as a pattern to create similar project files. You might create a template file that defines a
particular musical ensemble (say, a string quartet) or a particular studio configuration (MIDI instruments, audio outputs, and so on).
Templates make it fast and easy to create and configure new projects.
A key binding lets you associate Cakewalk commands with keys on your MIDI or computer keyboard. This makes it easy for you to
access specific features more quickly and efficiently. You can even assign saved layouts to key bindings for quick access.
See:
“Templates” on page 1258
“Key bindings” on page 1261

1257

Templates
Template files make it easy to create new projects with certain predefined settings. To create a template file, create a new project file
and arrange the project settings the way you want, then save the project as a template file. Template files have a file extension of
.cwt. When you create a new project, you can use the template as the basis for the new project. Cakewalk looks for template files in
a particular folder on your hard disk. By default, this folder is the program folder. To change the template directory, go to Edit >
Preferences > File - Folder Locations.
Every time you start Cakewalk, a default template named Basic.cwt is loaded. If you want, you can modify the Basic.cwt
template to suit your needs, or specify any other template as the default template (see “To specify the default project template” on
page 1259). If you do not want to automatically load a default template, go to Edit > Preferences > File - Advanced and clear the
On Startup Load Default Template check box.
As a rule, any parameter that is saved in a project file is also saved in a template file. Following are some useful parameters that are
saved in template files:

 Track configuration and track parameters
 Timebase
 Sysx banks
 File information and comments
 Tempo settings
 Meter and key settings
 Clock and synchronization information
 MIDI data
 MIDI In/Out/Thru settings
 MIDI metronome settings
 Selection start and end times
 Record mode and punch-in times
 Drum maps
 Audio data
 Automation
The following parameters are saved globally and are not stored in template or project files:

 Initialization file parameters
 Big Time font settings
 MIDI device settings
 Instrument definitions
 Autosave options
 Key bindings
 Color settings

Template example: three MIDI instruments
Suppose that your system has only a single MIDI output but you own three different synthesizers:

 One synthesizer set to receive on channels 1 through 8
 A general MIDI synthesizer module set to receive data on all 16 channels
 A drum machine set to receive on MIDI channel 10
Here’s how you can use a template to make it easy to create new projects that are already configured for the instruments you own.

To create the example template file
1. Choose File > New to create a new project file.
2. Insert 16 MIDI tracks.
3. In the Ch drop-down menu of track 10, enter 10. The drum machine responds to channel 10. For consistency, the drums can be
placed on track 10.
4. The second synthesizer responds to channels 1 through 8. These can be placed on tracks 1 through 8. For each track, enter the
corresponding channel number using the Ch drop-down menu for each track. You should now have tracks 1 through 8 set to
channels 1 through 8.
5. The third synthesizer can respond to 16 MIDI channels, but the only channels left are 9 and 11 through 16. Enter these numbers
in the corresponding tracks. You will need to mute the unused channels on the third synthesizer (1 through 8 and 10) so they
won’t play. These are assigned to the drum machine and the second synthesizer.
6. Name each track and set any track parameters, such as starting patch, volumes, panning, reverb, chorus, and transposition.
7. If you like, configure other parameters needed in your projects, such as auto-send Sysx banks, tempo settings, window
positions, and comments.
8. Choose File > Save, and save the file as a template named my3synths.
Now, each time you want to start working on a new project, you can simply load your template and start recording.

Templates and key bindings
Templates

Key bindings
Key bindings let you associate Cakewalk commands with keys on both your MIDI keyboard and your computer keyboard. This
makes it easy for you to access specific features more quickly and efficiently.
In addition, Cakewalk supports:

 Importing key bindings from other popular sequencer programs (see “Importing key bindings” on page 1263)
 Exporting key bindings from Cakewalk (see “Exporting key bindings” on page 1263)
 Use of any single key as a key binding (number keys on the number pad are separate keys from the other number keys)
 Changing the key bindings for commands that were previously hardwired, including hotkey commands in the various views
Note: The SPACEBAR is “globally” bound to the Play/stop button, so that when you have a plug-in window open, you can still
start and stop playback with the SPACEBAR.
Any one or two of the CTRL, ALT, and SHIFT keys can be used in combination with other keys. Preset key combinations appear in
bold, with the command that they’re currently assigned to listed at the bottom of the Preferences dialog box (Edit > Preferences >
Customization - Keyboard Shortcuts).
Rather than tie up all the notes on your MIDI keyboard with key bindings, Cakewalk lets you define a key binding shift key on your
MIDI keyboard that indicates when you want to use a key binding. For example, you could designate the lowest note on your MIDI
keyboard as the key binding shift key, and then assign different notes to specific commands (for example, C4 to Process >
Quantize, C5 to Process > Groove Quantize, and so on). If you press the C4 key by itself, the note plays normally. If you press the
C4 key in combination with the lowest key on your keyboard (the key binding shift key), then it’s just as if you had chosen the
Process > Quantize command from the menu.
You can choose one of two options to define the key binding shift key:

 MIDI key (typically, the very lowest or highest key on your MIDI keyboard)
 Controller event (typically, one of the pedals)
If you use a MIDI key as the key binding shift key, then you lose the ability to play that note by itself. When you play the note,
Cakewalk assumes you are about to choose one of the key bindings you have created and ignores the note. If this is ever a problem,
you can disable MIDI key bindings without canceling the key assignments and then re-enable the MIDI key bindings later on.
You can use a key binding to execute a command only when that command is possible. For example, the File > Save command is
disabled when no projects are open. If you have assigned the CTRL+F2 key combination to the File > Save command, it won’t do
anything when no projects are open.
You can use MIDI key bindings and computer keyboard key bindings at the same time.
Tip: You can assign up to 9 key bindings to buttons in the Control Bar’s Custom module. For details, see “Custom module” on page
686.

To create a key binding using the computer keyboard
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts (make sure the Advanced option is selected at the bottom of the
Preferences dialog box).
2. Check Computer in the Type of Keys list.
3. To quickly scroll to the key or key combination you want, click the Locate Key button, and then press the key or keys you want to
use.
4. Highlight the key combination you want to use in the Key list. Keys on the number pad appear as Num “n.” If a key or
combination is already bound to a global command by default, the name of the key appears in bold text, and the command it is
bound to appears at the bottom of the Key Bindings dialog box under Assigned to. Binding a key or combination to a command
and clicking OK overwrites any default binding for that key or combination.
5. In the Area menu, select the context in which you want to use the key binding.
6. Highlight the command you want to assign from the Function list.
7. Click Bind to bind the key combination to the command.
Cakewalk places an asterisk next to the key(s) that you chose, and draws a line from the highlighted key(s) to the command that
the key(s) will trigger. Any keys that are assigned to commands have asterisks next to them. Any commands that have keys
assigned to them list the keys in the Computer column and/or the MIDI column.
8. Repeat steps 3 through 7 for all the keys you want to bind.
9. If you want to save these key bindings for other sessions, make sure that the Save Changes for Next Session check box is
checked.
10. Click OK when you are done.
Cakewalk assigns the key(s) you chose.

To create a key binding using a MIDI keyboard
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts.
2. Check MIDI in the Type of Keys list.

4. If you haven’t already done so, create a key binding shift key by doing one of the following:

 Check Key under MIDI Shift Options, and enter the name of the key you want to use.
 Check Controller under MIDI Shift Options, and choose the controller you want from the list.
5. Highlight the key you want to bind from the Key list (if you click inside the Key list to put the focus on it, you can then play a note
on your MIDI keyboard, and the note automatically becomes highlighted in the Key list).
6. Select the command you want to bind from the Function list.
7. Click the Bind button.
Cakewalk places an asterisk next to the Key that you chose, and draws a line from the highlighted key to the command that it’s
bound to. Any keys that are assigned to commands have asterisks next to them. Any commands that have keys assigned to
them list the keys in the Computer column and/or the MIDI column.
8. Repeat steps 5 through 7 for all the keys you want to bind.
9. If you want to save these key bindings for other sessions, make sure that the Save Changes for Next Session check box is
checked.
10. Click OK when you are done.
Cakewalk assigns the key(s) you chose.

Notation and lyrics

This section describes three Cakewalk views that are used to edit the music notation and lyrics of your project.

 Cakewalk’s Staff view lets you work with your composition in a standard musical staff, guitar tablature and a virtual guitar
fretboard. You can add, move, and delete notes with your mouse or with your computer keyboard. You can add chord names,
guitar chord grids, expression marks, hairpin symbols, pedal marks, and lyrics. And you can print professional-quality notation of
a complete arrangement or individual parts, with up to 24 staves per page.

 The Meter/Key view lets you view, insert, and edit meter and key changes at any measure boundary in the project.
 The Lyrics view lets you edit a track’s lyrics, and can be used to cue you with the lyrics during playback or recording.

The Staff view
The Staff view is composed of a Staff pane and a Fretboard.
When you first open the Staff view, you may see only the Staff and not the Fretboard. Resize the Staff view by dragging its edges
until you can see everything easily. When you save your file, whatever size the Staff view is will be the way it appears the next time
you open the file.
The Staff pane displays MIDI note events as musical notation. For some musicians, this may be the most familiar and comfortable
view in which to work. The Staff pane provides many features that make it easy for you to compose, edit, and print music.
For guitar players who are new to musical notation, the Fretboard represents the notes in the Staff pane as they would appear on a
six-string guitar neck in standard tuning. The number of strings and the tuning are configurable. All notes that appear in the Staff
pane at the Now time are shown in the Fretboard. If you enter notes in the Staff at the Now time, they appear on the Fretboard.
Likewise, you can enter notes into the Staff at the Now time by clicking the guitar strings on the fretboard. Notes and chords shown
in the Fretboard can be easily edited by dragging them up and down the guitar strings.

“Snap to Scale” on page 878.

Staff pane layout
The Staff pane can display up to 24 staves of standard and percussion notation. When you open the Staff pane, Cakewalk
automatically picks a clef for each track—bass or treble—by looking at the range of pitches in the track. If a track has notes that fall
into both clefs, or no notes at all, Cakewalk automatically splits the track into two staves, treble and bass. You can change the
assignment of clefs with the Staff View Layout dialog box.
When you split a track into treble and bass staves, you must select a split point. Notes at or above the split are placed into a treble
staff, notes below the split are placed into a bass staff.
A wide variety of editing options for notes, layout, and MIDI effects are available from the Staff pane right-click menu.
Percussion settings are discussed in the section “Setting up a percussion track” on page 1298.

Inserting notes on the staff
You can add notes to your composition with simple point-and-click techniques. To help with your composing, Cakewalk gives you
audio feedback as you place each note.
You can insert notes anywhere in the Staff pane, but inserting them at the Now time gives you control over the exact time you want
to insert to. The SHIFT+RIGHT/LEFT ARROW command moves the Now Time forward or backward by the amount of the note
duration you choose. To specify a note duration for new notes, use the Duration control in the Control Bar’s Tools module. The
CTRL+RIGHT ARROW/CTRL+LEFT ARROW commands pages you through the track, sounding each note as the cursor passes
over it. You can also page through the track by choosing the Edit > Play Previous and Edit > Play Next commands in the Staff view
menu.
Note: You cannot insert notes whose durations are less than the value in the Display Resolution field, which accessed via the
View > Display Resolution command in the Staff view menu.
You may want to pick a different snap-to grid value for a particular note. For example, if you want to insert a half note in the last
quarter note position in a measure (in order to get two tied quarter notes), you must set the snap resolution to a quarter note.
Cakewalk will automatically convert the half note to two tied quarter notes. The same method can be used to insert a syncopated
note, such as a quarter note at an eighth note position.
You may also want to disable the View > Fill Durations and View > Trim Durations options before you enter notes on the staff.
This will allow you to see the true durations of all the notes you enter. These options are discussed in “Changing the way notes are
displayed” on page 1285.

To insert a note on the staff
1. Disable the View > Fill Durations and View > Trim Durations options in the Staff view menu, if desired (this is usually the best
way when you’re entering notes).
2. Click the Staff view View menu and choose Display Resolution, then choose a resolution that’s as small or slightly smaller than
the smallest note you plan to enter.
3. Select the Draw Freehand tool in the Control Bar.
4. Select a note draw duration button in the Staff view, or select a value in the Control Bar’s Tools module. You cannot insert a note
that’s shorter in length than the note in the Display Resolution field.
Tip: You can click an existing Note event to inherit its duration and apply it to new Note events. For details, see “Use note duration
value from last touched note” on page 624.
5. Move the Now time to the location where you want the new note by pressing SHIFT+RIGHT ARROW or SHIFT+LEFT ARROW.
Notice the vertical line that marks the Now time in the Staff pane. The line moves by the duration of the note you selected to
enter.
6. Click the cursor on the vertical line at the pitch that you want.
7. To add a sharp or flat, select the Smart tool in the Control Bar, right-click the note to open the Note Properties dialog box—in the
Pitch field, use the + or - buttons to raise or lower the pitch, and click OK. You can type enharmonic spellings into the Pitch field,
such as C#5, E”4. and Fx6. The double quotation mark produces a double flat, and the x produces a double sharp.
Cakewalk places the new note in the staff. If desired, drag the note horizontally or vertically to a new time or pitch.

Inserting notes with the Fretboard
You can also enter notes onto the staff from the fretboard using the mouse. You always enter notes into the staff at the Now time.

To insert notes on the Fretboard with the mouse
1. Click in the Time Ruler to set the Now time.
2. Select the Draw Freehand tool in the Control Bar.
3. Select a note duration, and a modifier (dot or triplet) if desired.
4. Click on the guitar strings in the fretboard to enter notes. You can enter up to six simultaneous notes (one per string).
5. Advance the Now Time by the current note duration using the right arrow key while holding down the shift key. This allows you to
quickly enter a series of notes.

Selecting notes
Use the Select tool in the Control Bar to make selections. Selection methods in the Staff view are similar to those in other views.
Here is a summary:
To do this

Do this

Select a note or other symbol

Click it

Select several symbols at once

Click and drag a rectangle around them

Add symbols to the selection

Press SHIFT and either click on the symbols or drag a rectangle around the events

Add or remove symbols from the selection

Press CTRL and either click on the symbols or drag a rectangle around the events

Select symbols in a time range

Click and drag in the Time Ruler

Select symbols between two markers

Click between the markers

Remove all selections

Click in an empty area

Note: Tied notes must be selected together, since the series is really just a single MIDI note. To select tied notes, you must
click or drag a rectangle around the first note of the series.
For more information about selecting notes, see “Smart tool” on page 577 and “Select tool” on page 584.

Moving, copying, and deleting notes on the staff
Selections can be cut, copied, pasted, and deleted with Edit menu commands. The techniques are similar to those used in other
views. Selections can also be dragged and dropped to copy or move them. To keep track of your current position while dragging, you
can keep an eye on the time and pitch locator in the upper-right corner of the Staff view.
Notes can be dragged horizontally, to a new time, or vertically, to a new pitch or staff. When you drag a note up or down to a new
pitch, the note normally snaps to the notes in the current key signature (diatonic scale). This makes it easy to drag notes quickly
among pitches that are in the current key.
If you need to transpose more than a few notes, use the Process > Transpose command. For more information, see “Transposing”
on page 863.

To move a single note in the Staff view
1. Select the Select tool or Draw tool in the Control Bar.
2. Click the note to be moved.
3. Drag the note to a new time, pitch, or staff.
Cakewalk moves the note to the new location.

To move several notes in the Staff view
1. Select the Select tool in the Control Bar.
2. Select the notes to be moved.
3. Click one of the selected notes.
4. Drag the notes to a new time, pitch, or staff.
Cakewalk moves the notes to the new location.

To copy one or more notes in the Staff view
1. Select the Select tool in the Control Bar.
2. Select the notes to be copied.
3. Press and hold the CTRL key.
4. Drag the notes to a new time, pitch, or staff.
Cakewalk inserts copies of the notes at the new location.

To erase notes with the Erase tool
1. Select the Erase tool in the Control Bar.
2. Click any notehead to erase the note.
3. To erase several notes, click and drag with the Erase tool.
Any notes whose notehead is touched by the eraser will be deleted.

Moving notes from within the Fretboard
You can drag notes displayed in the fretboard horizontally along each string to change their pitch. They always change in the
chromatic scale. You can not drag notes from one string to another.

To change the pitch of a single note in the Fretboard
1. Click in the Time Ruler to set the Now time to the time of the note you want to change.
2. Select the Select tool or Draw tool in the Control Bar.
3. Drag the note along the string to a new fret.
Cakewalk moves the note to the new pitch.

To change the pitch of a chord in the Fretboard
1. Click in the Time Ruler to set the Now time to the time of the chord you want to change.
2. Select the Select tool in the Control Bar.
3. While pressing SHIFT, click each of the notes you would like to change.
4. While continuing to press SHIFT, drag the notes along the strings.
Cakewalk moves the notes you selected to the new pitches.
Tip: You can also move the Now time pointer to the exact note by using the Step Play buttons.

Auditioning
Sometimes it is useful to listen to your music slowly, note-by-note, rather than at full speed. For example, you may need to locate a
bad note, or you may be trying to learn the correct fingering for a difficult passage.
The Staff view has two features that let you audition your composition at reduced speed: Scrub and Step Play. The Scrub tool lets
you drag a vertical bar over the staff, playing the notes as it goes. You can scrub backward or forward at any speed. Step Play lets
you step through the project note by note, in either direction.

To audition with the Scrub tool
1. Hold down the J key to activate the Scrub tool.
2. Drag the mouse horizontally through the Staff pane to play the notes.
Cakewalk plays any notes the scrub line passes over.

To play notes with Step Play
1. Set the Now time by clicking in the Time Ruler.
2. Step through the music as follows:

Deglitch dialog
When recording MIDI guitar, even the best players occasionally play unintended notes. The Deglitch feature allows you to filter out
the softest, shortest, and highest notes in the file.
There are three filters in the Deglitch dialog:

Pitch
With the Pitch filter you can set the maximum pitch allowed in the track. If a MIDI event has a higher pitch than the maximum you set,
it is removed.

Velocity
With the Velocity filter you can set a minimum velocity allowed in the track. If a MIDI event has a lower velocity than the one you set,
it is removed.

Duration
With the Duration filter you can set a minimum note duration for the track in either ticks or milliseconds. If a MIDI event has a shorter
duration than the one you set, it is removed.

To use the Deglitch filter
1. Select a track or a section of track.
2. Select Process > Deglitch from the menu.
The Deglitch dialog box appears.
3. Check each of the filters you want to use.
4. Enter the parameters (maximum or minimum values) you want for each of the filters you are using.
5. Click OK.
If you are not happy with the result, select Edit > Undo to restore the original MIDI track.

Working with triplets
The Staff view places certain limitations on the use of triplets. The limitations are:

 Triplets must occur in full sets of three.
 All three steps in a triplet must be notes (no rests) of the same basic duration.
 There can be no ties in or out of, or within the triplet.
In most cases, the Staff view can recognize triplets in MIDI data. However, the slight timing inaccuracies inherent in live
performances can complicate the detection of triplets. If working from performance data, you may find it useful to quantize the notes
closer to exact triplet positions using the Process > Quantize command. See “Quantizing” on page 908 for details.

To enter a triplet
1. Enable Snap to Grid in the Control Bar’s Snap module.
2. Select the Draw tool in the Control Bar.
3. Select a triplet note duration in the Tools module.
4. Enter the first note at the desired location in the staff.
Cakewalk inserts all three triplet notes at the same pitch. You can then drag the second and third notes to their correct pitch
locations.

Notation and lyrics
Basic musical editing

Beaming of rests
The Staff view supports beaming of rests, a practice that is popular with rhythmically complex music. Beam lengths are extended to
include rests that are integral parts of the beamed group of notes. Short stems, called stemlets, extend from the beam toward the
rest. This makes the rhythms easier to read, because the beat boundaries are made clear.

To enable beaming of rests
1. Click the Staff view Edit menu and choose Layout to open the Staff View Layout dialog box.
2. Select the Beam Rests option.
3. Click OK.
Thereafter, the Staff view beams rests as though they were notes.

Changing the way notes are displayed
Unlike musical notation programs, Cakewalk uses the MIDI events themselves as the permanent representation of the music; thus,
the Staff view is only an interpretation of a MIDI performance.
MIDI notes do not always correspond exactly to notes on a staff. Whereas a staff defines precise grid-like starting times and
durations for notes, a MIDI note can start at any arbitrary time during the project, and last for any length of time. If you record a
performance from a MIDI keyboard, for example, you’ll find that some notes may start slightly before the beat, and some a little after,
and that the notes end a little late or a little early. Although these slight imperfections are what gives a performance its “human”
quality, you don’t necessarily want to see all these imperfections notated with excruciating precision.
The Staff view has two options you can select to affect the way MIDI notes are displayed on the staff:
Option

Purpose

Fill Durations

Visually rounds up note durations to the next beat or the next note, whichever comes first.

Trim Durations

Visually rounds down note durations if they extend a little way past the start of the next note.

Here’s what the Staff view looks like with and without these options:
Figure 554. Fill and Trim off.

Figure 555. Fill and Trim on.

On the other hand, if you are entering notes into the Staff view with the mouse, Fill Durations and Trim Durations may produce
confusing results. For example, with Fill Durations, an inserted eighth note in 4/4 time would look like a quarter note until you insert
another eighth note immediately following it. It is recommended that you turn off the Fill Durations and Trim Durations options
when entering notes; these options are more appropriate for looking at notes you recorded via a performance.

Basic musical editing

1285

Using enharmonic spellings
Any musical note can be referred to by several different names. For example, C#3 and Db3 identify the same pitch, as do G#4 and
Ab4. The most appropriate name depends upon the current key signature, but can also depend on musical context.
Cakewalk uses a set of rules to automatically add accidentals (sharps, flats and naturals) to notes based on the current key
signature. These rules cover the most common musical situations and usually lead to pleasing results. However, there is no
guaranteed right way to resolve accidentals. Doing so ultimately requires knowledge regarding what key or scale is being evoked—
knowledge that only the composer possesses. For example, if a modulation is being prepared, then the new key signature has not
yet been completely established, and the harmony has already begun to shift. In fact, there may not even be a scale in a diatonic
sense: chromatic scales, for instance, are supposed to sharp on the way up and flat on the way down. Because no set of rules will
suffice for all situations, the composer needs the ability to override any default choice.
Notes in Cakewalk normally do not have a forced enharmonic spelling. This means that they will automatically change to match the
default for a new key signature. If you specify spelling that matches the default choice, Cakewalk will drop any forced spelling and
switch back to default behavior. Otherwise, the forced spelling is remembered for that note, and will not change to follow the key
signature. If you change the pitch of a note by some other means (for instance, by dragging it up or down), it will lose any forced
spelling, because it very likely no longer applies to the new pitch. Enharmonic spelling overrides for each note are saved in the
project file.
When you type a note’s enharmonic spelling, use the following table as a guide.

Accidental

Flat

b

Cb5

#

C#5

Double flat

To change a note’s enharmonic spelling
1. Select the Smart tool in the Control Bar and right-click the note to open the Note Properties dialog box.
2. In the Pitch textbox, type a new spelling for the note.
3. Click OK.
Cakewalk displays the note with the new enharmonic spelling.
You can change enharmonic spellings in other views, such as the Event List view, by similarly typing a new spelling wherever the
note pitch is displayed as a text string.
You can also use the Process > Find/Change command to change enharmonic spellings—for example, to change multiple
occurrences of Eb5 to D#5, or even all Ebs to D#s. See “Process > Find/Change” on page 884 for more information.

MIDI Channels and the Fretboard
You can display notes on the fretboard based on the note event’s MIDI channel. (Do not confuse this with the Track MIDI channel.) A
single track can hold events on many different MIDI channels. See “Assigning a MIDI channel (Chn)” on page 320 for more
information. Displaying notes using this method is 100% accurate because each string is represented by an individual MIDI channel.
For example, String 1 = MIDI channel 11, String 2 = MIDI channel 12, etc.

To display notes on the Fretboard using their MIDI channels
1. Set your MIDI guitar to transmit on 6 consecutive channels. This is often referred to as “MONO” mode. Refer to your MIDI Guitar
device documentation for more information.
2. Select and Arm a track.
3. If you want the data from all 6 strings to be recorded to a single track, set the Input to OMNI. If you want each string on a
separate track, you need to set up each individual track to record on the corresponding MIDI channel. The GT-30 Guitar
Synthesizer template is designed to do this, so you may want to open that from the Start Screen or from the File menu. To use
the File menu method, choose File > Open and choose Cakewalk Template from the Files of type field. Then choose the
Roland GT-30 Guitar Synthesizer template.
4. Open the Staff view.
5. Click the Staff view Edit menu and choose Layout to open the Staff View Layout dialog box.
6. Click Define.
7. In the Method field, click MIDI Channel.
8. In the 1st Channel field, set Cakewalk to transmit on the same series of MIDI channels that you chose in step 1. Select 1 for 16, 2 for 2-7, etc.
MIDI guitar devices can transmit in MONO using a different series of MIDI channels, but Cakewalk needs to be listening to the
same channels in order to properly display the MIDI guitar input.
9. Click Close.
10. Click OK.
Cakewalk displays notes on the Fretboard based on their MIDI channels.
If you are planning to record or input notes from a MIDI guitar synth or MIDI converter, you need to set this up on the instrument. In
the case of the Roland GT-30, for example, you set it to send on MIDI Channel 11, MONO. This sends out each corresponding string
on channels 11-16.

Chords and marks
The Staff view lets you add and edit chord symbols, dynamic markings, hairpin symbols, and pedal events. Like notes, these
symbols are placed in the score with the Draw Freehand tool. They can be selected, cut, copied, pasted, deleted, and dragged and
dropped. With the exception of pedal marks, though, these symbols have no audible effect; they serve only to enhance and clarify
the printed score.

Adding chord symbols
The Staff view lets you enter chord symbols above the staff. You can enter both ordinary chord names and guitar chord symbols,
which display both the chord name and fingering. Cakewalk has a large number of predefined chords from which you can choose.
You can also define and save your own chords.
If a track is split into treble/bass staves, chords are allowed only above the upper (treble) staff.
Cakewalk stores its library of chords in the file Chords.liw. The chords in the library are sorted into groups. You can add and
remove chords from the library, create new groups (i.e., for alternative guitar tunings), and add chords from a different library file.
You edit chords in the Chord Properties dialog box. Chord properties are shown in the following table.

Adding expression marks
Expression marks tell a performer how to interpret the notes and durations on the page. They provide a necessary supplement to
simple notation, in which notes have only pitch and duration, but no hint of how loudly, softly, or smoothly, they are to be played.
Dynamic marks—from ppp (pianissimo) for “very, very softly” through fff (fortissimo) for “very, very forcefully”—allow notation to
convey volume instructions. Expression marks are also needed to specify other aspects of performance, such as whether a passage
is to be played legato or staccato. Finally, expression marks can be used to convey to the performer the composer's suggestions or
requirements as to how a passage should be interpreted. In such cases the language used can leave much to the imagination, as in
with majesty or abrasively.
Expression marks do not change the underlying MIDI data. They only provide information to the reader on how a piece should be
performed.
If the track is split into treble/bass staves, expression marks are allowed only below the treble staff.
When entering an expression mark, you can leave a dangling hyphen at the end of an expression mark to insert automatic spaced
hyphens until the next expression mark. For example:
cresc.

-

-

-

ff

It is often desirable to terminate such a series of hyphens with a blank expression mark. For example:
accel.

-

-

Expression text is italicized in the Staff view. Standard dynamic markings also appear bold.

To add an expression mark
1. Select the Draw Freehand tool in the Control Bar.
2. Click the Expression button

Adding hairpin symbols
Some musical phrases vary dynamically, increasing or decreasing in loudness for dramatic effect. Cakewalk lets you insert
traditional crescendo and diminuendo hairpin symbols that convey this information to a performer, as shown here:

If the track is split into treble/bass staves, hairpin symbols are allowed only below the treble staff.

To add a hairpin symbol
1. Select the Draw Freehand tool in the Control Bar.
2. Click the Hairpin button

in the Staff view.

3. Position the pointer below the staff (the pointer changes to a pencil when you are in a legal position).
4. Click to place a hairpin symbol.
Cakewalk inserts a copy of the most recently added hairpin symbol, which you can edit as desired.

To edit a hairpin symbol
1. Right-click on the hairpin symbol you want to edit.
The Hairpin Properties dialog box appears.
2. Change any of the following parameters:

 Time. The beginning time of the hairpin symbol
 Crescendo or Diminuendo.
 Duration. Enter the number of beats followed by a colon (for example 4: for one measure in 4/4 time) or a PPQ number
value.

Chords and marks

Adding pedal marks
Pedal marks traditionally indicate where the sustain pedal of a piano is to be pressed and for how long. With Cakewalk, you can
achieve the same effect by inserting a pair of symbols indicating when the sustain pedal controller is to be turned on (down) and
when it is to be turned off (up). Unlike chord symbols, expression marks, and hairpin symbols, each pedal symbol corresponds to a
MIDI event. The other symbols are purely ornamental, intended to provide a composer with a way to communicate suggestions or
requirements to performers.
Pedal event parameters are as follows:
Parameters

Meaning

Time

The time of the event, in measures, beats, and ticks (MBT).

Channel

The MIDI channel on which the event will be sent.

Value

The event value. A value of 127 depresses the pedal, a value of 0 raises it. (Some advanced synthesizers support
values between 0 and 127 for “partial pedaling.”)

If the track is split into treble/bass staves, pedal marks are allowed only below the bass staff.
You can suppress the display of all pedal marks by deselecting the Show Pedal Events option in the Staff view's Layout dialog
box.

To add a pedal mark
1. Select the Draw Freehand tool in the Control Bar.

Tablature
The Staff view can display guitar or bass MIDI tracks as tablature. You can generate and edit tablature or enter notes on either the
fretboard or on the tablature staff to create a new track. You can export tablature to an ASCII file for printing or distribution on the
Web.

Tablature settings
Both the Staff View Layout dialog box and the Tablature Settings dialog box create tablature settings for a whole track at a time.
To modify tablature for selected parts of a track, select part of a track and use the Edit > Regenerate TAB command.
In the Staff View Layout dialog box you can choose a preset style of tablature by choosing from the Preset pop-up menu, or you
can define your own style by clicking the Define button in the Staff View Layout dialog box to open the Tablature Settings dialog
box.

To define a tablature style
1. Click the Staff view Edit menu and choose Layout to open the Staff View Layout dialog box, then click the name of the track
you want to define tablature for.
2. Click the Define button (lower right corner).
The Tablature Settings dialog box appears.
3. Click the Tablature tab and choose a tablature method from the Method drop-down list. There are three methods to determine
how the TAB is displayed:

 Floating. Which allows the notes to spread over the entire fretboard.
 Fixed. This specifies where on the neck these notes should be played. When Fixed is selected the Finger span and
Lowest fret fields are used together to define the “box” where the notes are displayed. The Finger span parameter
determines how many consecutive frets will be used to display the note. For example, if Finger span is set to 4, then
Cakewalk will attempt to place all the notes within those 4 frets. The Lowest Fret then determines where on the fretboard the
notes will be displayed within the Finger span. The red box in the fretboard display changes to reflect the settings in these two
parameters.

 MIDI Channel. This uses the event's MIDI channel to determine which string the note should be displayed on. When MIDI
Channel is selected, the user chooses which series of MIDI Channels should be considered. This is useful for MIDI guitarists
that record parts in MONO mode, where each string transmits on a different MIDI channel. (Values: 1 - 11). Selecting 1 in the
1st Channel field will cause it to use MIDI channels 1 - 6, selecting 2, 2 - 7, and so on.)
Note: Select the Skip Channel 10 option if you are using a Yamaha G50 or other device which reserves channel 10.

4. Type a number into the Number of Frets field. This determines how many frets the guitar has that the tab is based on.
5. In the String Tuning fields, choose the instrument from the drop-down list and number of strings from the Number of Strings
field.
The open string pitches for the instrument you choose automatically appear in the String Number fields below the drop-down
list.

6. Customize any of the open string pitches by using the + or - buttons on the String Number fields.
7. Save your settings by typing a name into the Preset field at the top of the dialog box and clicking the disk icon next to it. You can
remove presets from the list by clicking the X button next to the disk icon.
The next time you want to use these settings for a track, choose your Preset in the Staff View Layout dialog box from the Presets
drop-down list.

Changing Fretboard texture and orientation
You can change fretboard texture and orientation (high string on top or bottom of neck) in the Staff View Layout dialog box, or by
right-clicking the Fretboard.

To change the Fretboard texture and orientation
1. Click the Staff view Edit menu and choose Layout to open the Staff View Layout dialog box.
2. Click the Define button (lower right corner).
The Tablature Settings dialog box appears.
3. Click the Fretboard tab.
4. In the Texture field, choose a texture from the drop-down list.
5. If you want to reverse the standard string orientation, in the Orientation field click Low String on Top (Mirror).
6. Click OK.
The Fretboard changes to reflect your choices.

Quick TAB
Cakewalk quickly creates a tablature based on standard fingering patterns. After you try the quick version, you can customize the
tablature to your liking.

To create a quick TAB
1. Open a file that contains a MIDI guitar track.
2. In the Track view, select the track number of the track you want to display tablature for.
3. Select Views > Staff View.
The Staff view appears, displaying a fretboard and the notation of your MIDI track. To see everything, you may need to resize the
Staff view by dragging the top border upward a few inches.
4. Click the Staff view Edit menu and choose Quick TAB.
A tablature grid appears, displaying the fret numbers for all the notes in the track.
5. From the File menu, choose Save. Saving your file saves TAB settings for each track you generated TABs for.
Press the SPACEBAR to play your file. Notice that the Fretboard displays the name of each note above the string and fret you would
play it on as the note plays.

Regenerate TAB
The Regenerate TAB command works on selected regions in a track to modify the fingering according to the method you choose.
The TAB display by default uses the Floating algorithm which allows the notes to spread over the entire fretboard. By choosing the
Fixed algorithm instead, you can designate a specific finger span and lowest fret which causes the TAB of a selected region to be
displayed within this range. This usually creates a more compact fingering system.
The Regenerate TAB command gives you a third choice for displaying tablature MIDI channel. This uses the event's MIDI channel
to determine which string the note should be displayed on. When MIDI Channel is selected, the user chooses which series of MIDI
Channels should be considered. This is useful for MIDI guitarists that record parts in MONO mode, where each string transmits on a
different MIDI channel.

To regenerate TAB
1. Select the Select tool in the Control Bar and drag a rectangle around the notes or TAB numbers you want to change.
2. Click the Staff view Edit menu and choose Regenerate TAB to open the Regenerate Tablature dialog box.
3. Select Fixed from the Method field and fill in values for Finger Span (usually 4), Lowest Fret, and Number of Frets (usually
21).
4. Click OK.
Cakewalk regenerates a TAB based on your specifications. If notes are out of the range you specified, Cakewalk displays them as
close to that range as possible.

Entering notes from the TAB staff
You can enter notes or chords directly from the TAB staff.

To enter notes from the TAB staff
1. Open the Staff View.
2. Click the Staff view Edit menu and choose Quick TAB.
3. Press CTRL+HOME to move the Now Time to the start of the project.
4. Select the desired note duration in the Control Bar’s Tools module.

Working with percussion
The Staff view can display percussion tracks on a five-line percussion staff or on a single percussion line. The staff usually displays
notes for a drum set or multiple percussion instruments; the line is used to display notes for a single instrument (although it need not
be so).
Cakewalk lets you control the appearance of percussion staffs in considerable detail. You can display percussion notes using
several different types of noteheads and articulation symbols, and you can map any percussion sound to any position on the
percussion staff (in a percussion track, each MIDI note value designates a different percussion instrument; mapping lets you display
any instrument in any position on the staff, regardless of the underlying MIDI note value). You can save your settings as a preset,
and use them again on other tracks and in other projects. Cakewalk supplies a standard preset based on the General MIDI
percussion standard and popularly accepted percussion staff positions and noteheads.
See:
“Setting up a percussion track” on page 1298
“Setting up a percussion staff or line” on page 1298
“Ghost strokes” on page 1300

Setting up a percussion track
Before you use the percussion capabilities of the Staff view, your percussion track should be set up correctly. This will allow you to
hear the proper sounds when placing notes and during playback, and will allow you to see the correct percussion instrument names
rather than generic note names in the Piano Roll view, Event List view, and Percussion Notation dialog box.

To set up a percussion track
1. Select the track so it appears in the Track Inspector.
2. In the Track Inspector, assign the Output and Channel for your percussion instrument. For example, if the output is assigned to a
sound card that supports General MIDI, use channel 10.
3. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Instruments.
4. Make sure that the output/channel combination used by your track is assigned to a percussion instrument definition. For
example, channel 10 of a General MIDI output should be assigned to the General MIDI Drums instrument definition.
5. Click OK in both dialog boxes.
Cakewalk shows the new track output and channel in the Track view, and will use the proper percussion instrument names in the
Piano Roll view, Event List view, and Percussion Notation dialog box.
For more information about instrument definitions, see “Instrument definitions” on page 1309.

Setting up a percussion staff or line
The first time you display a percussion track in the Staff view, Cakewalk picks a default percussion clef for the track. Tracks with only
one note value are assigned the Percussion Line clef. Tracks with multiple note values are assigned the Percussion Staff clef.
If you want to change a Percussion Staff to a Percussion Line or vice versa, or if you want to change another type of staff to a
percussion staff, you can do so in the Staff View Layout dialog box. If you change a track’s clef to a non-percussion clef, the
percussion notation settings will be lost.
The lowest and highest lines on the Percussion clef are E5 and F6, respectively. The Percussion Line represents E5.
By default, percussion staves are given Cakewalk’s default note bindings and notehead assignments. If you want to use your own
notation, or if you want to set up the appearance of a percussion line, you need to use the Percussion Notation Key dialog box. In
this dialog box, the percussion sounds and staff positions that are bound have an asterisk near their names. When you select a
bound percussion sound, a line joins the sound to its staff position. Each percussion sound can be bound only to a single position,
but each position may be bound to several sounds. You can use different notehead types and articulation symbols to visually
distinguish the sounds.

Ghost strokes
In percussion notation, parentheses around a note mean that it is a ghost stroke, played very lightly and barely heard. Cakewalk
supports ghost strokes by displaying parentheses around any percussion note event with velocity less than 32 (a fixed, arbitrary
threshold). If necessary, you can adjust the Vel+ parameter of the track and the velocities of the individual notes to effectively move
this threshold without changing the way the note sounds.
The following figure shows two tracks displaying ghost strokes.

Printing
The Staff view provides printing support of standard musical notation in nine staff sizes. The Staff view prints general project
information from the Notes Browser (see “Using the Notes Browser” on page 737) at the beginning of the score, including the song's
title (or file name), subtitle (dedication), playing instructions, author/composer, and copyright. In addition, Cakewalk identifies the
tracks by number and name, and numbers each measure and each page.
Cakewalk lets you select a size for your printed score. Engravers have nine standardized sizes of the five-line staff. The vertical
distance between the lines of each staff is called its rastral size, or measurement. Each rastral size has a number and is used by
publishers for a specific genre of musical composition.

Export to MusicXML
Cakewalk lets you export notation to the MusicXML format, which can be used in other notation programs such as Finale and
Sibelius. MusicXML serves as a functional standard for saving notation data in a better way than MIDI.
Note: Cakewalk can export MusicXML files, but can not import MusicXML files. To import scores into Cakewalk, first export
them to a standard MIDI file, then import the MIDI file into Cakewalk.
Cakewalk’s Staff view includes a layer of visual quantization to allow complex MIDI data to be displayed as standard notation. This
includes the Display Resolution, Fill Durations and Trim Durations settings. When exporting to MusicXML, the notation is
exported exactly the way it is displayed in the Staff View after visual quantization is applied, which could differ from what is stored as
MIDI data.

The Meter/Key view
The Meter/Key view lets you enter meter and key changes at measure boundaries. Meter and key changes affect all tracks.
See:
“What Is meter?” on page 1302
“What Is key?” on page 1303
“Opening the Meter/Key view” on page 1303
“Adding and editing meter/key changes” on page 1304
“Music notation for non-concert-key instruments” on page 1305

What Is meter?
The meter—also known as the time signature—describes how to divide time into rhythmic pulses. When you set the meter, you are
specifying the number of beats per measure and the note value of each beat. Common meters include:

 2/4 (two beats per measure, quarter note gets a beat)
 4/4 (four beats per measure, quarter note gets a beat)
 3/4 (three beats per measure, quarter note gets a beat)
 6/8 (six beats per measure, eighth note gets a beat)
The top number of a meter is the number of beats per measure, and can be from 1 through 99. The bottom number of a meter is the
value of each beat; you can pick from a list of values ranging from a whole note to a thirty-second note.
The meter affects several things in Cakewalk:

 Metronome accents
 How measure, beat, and tick (MBT) times are calculated and displayed
 How the Staff view is drawn
While Cakewalk in general allows meters to have up to 99 beats per measure, the Staff view cannot display such measures. You will
receive an error message if you try to use the Staff view with meters exceeding its limit.
Internally, Cakewalk stores times as “raw” ticks or clock pulses. The timebase—the number of pulses per quarter note (PPQ)—is
adjustable, from 48 to 960 PPQ. If you are using a timebase of 120 PPQ and the project file is in 4/4 time, then a whole measure
equals 480 ticks. See “Setting the MIDI timing resolution” on page 351 for more information about the timebase.
Usually the easiest approach to working with meter changes is to set all of them up before doing any recording. Use the Meter/Key
view or the Project > Insert Meter/Key Change command to add meter changes at the desired measures.

Notation and lyrics
The Meter/Key view

What Is key?
In musical terms, a key is a system of related notes based on the tonic (the base pitch) of a major or minor scale. A key signature is
a group of sharps or flats placed immediately to the right of the clef sign. The key signature tells a performer that certain notes are to
be systematically raised or lowered.
There are fifteen different key signatures—seven with sharps, seven with flats, and one without either. The fifteen key signatures
correspond to fifteen different major scales, and to fifteen different minor scales (for example, the key signature for C major is the
same as for A minor).
The key signature affects several things in Cakewalk:

 The key signature controls how Cakewalk displays notes. In the Event List view and some dialog boxes, Cakewalk converts the
MIDI pitch number to labels like Db (D-flat in the key of C).

 The Staff view uses the key signature to display notation correctly.
 How the notes are transposed when the Diatonic option is enabled.
The key signature affects only how Cakewalk displays pitches for you. Changing the key signature does not affect the MIDI key
number (pitch) stored with each note. To actually transpose pitches, use the Transpose command or edit notes individually by using
the Piano Roll, Event List, or Staff views.
Note: Groove clips are not affected by changes to your project’s key. Groove clips follow the default project pitch value,
specified in Project > Set Default Groove Clip Pitch, and Pitch markers in the Time Ruler. For more information, see “Using
pitch markers in the Track view” on page 811.
Frequently you use only one key signature for an entire project, but Cakewalk supports multiple key signatures and multiple meter
changes in a project. The default key is C. You can change these defaults by creating your own default template file. For more
information, see “Templates” on page 1258.

Opening the Meter/Key view
To open the Meter/Key view, choose Views > Meter/Key.
The Meter/Key view displays a list of meter/key changes in the project. There is always an entry for measure 1, because there must
always be a meter and key signature for the project. The default meter is 4/4 and the default key is C. You can change these defaults
by creating your own default template file. For more information, see “Templates” on page 1258.
Each meter/key change has the following properties:

Property

Meaning

At Measure

The measure where the meter/key change takes place.

Beats per Measure

The number of beats per measure, the upper number in the time signature.

Beat Value

The note length of a beat, the lower number in the time signature. 2 corresponds to a half note, 4 to a quarter
note, 8 to an eighth note, etc.

Music notation for non-concert-key instruments
For historical reasons, certain musical instruments are traditionally notated in a transposed key rather than the actual key. For
example, a normal (Bb) trumpet part is written in the key one whole step higher than the actual concert key, and an Eb alto sax part
is written a major sixth higher. Musicians have traditionally learned to read and refer to the notes they play using the proper
transposition interval for their instrument.
Cakewalk supports these non-concert instrumental keys through use of the Key+ control in the Track Inspector. Simply enter or
record the notes into the instrument's track transposed as the musician would expect them, and then set the proper transposition
interval in the Key+ control to make it play in the correct key. For example, a Bb trumpet track should have all its notes a whole note
higher than concert pitch, and should have Key+ set to -2 to transpose it two chromatic steps back down. Remember, not all
trumpets are Bb instruments!

To notate a Bb trumpet part
1. Record or enter the notes using the pitches that the musician who will be reading the part needs to see. For example, if the nontransposing instruments are playing in the key of C, a Bb trumpet player needs to see the notes a whole step higher—the key of
D. The instrument itself sounds a whole step lower than concert pitch, so when a Bb trumpet plays in the key of D, it sounds in
the key of C.
Now that the pitches appear the way that the trumpet player needs to see them, the problem is that when you play your project,
the MIDI notes in the trumpet track sound a whole step too high.
2. In the Track Inspector, force Cakewalk to play the trumpet track a whole step lower by entering -2 (negative 2) in the Key+ field
and pressing ENTER.
Now the trumpet part in the Staff view appears in the key of D—Cakewalk automatically adds two sharps to the trumpet track’s key
signature—but the track sounds in the key of C because you entered -2 in the Key+ field (you may need to close the Staff view and
reopen it to see the new key signature). The Staff view automatically transposes the key signature for each track according to the
track's Key+ value. Multiple tracks appear and can be printed as an orchestral score, with the proper different key signatures for
each track.
Note that this Key+ information is saved in Cakewalk .cwp files, but not in standard MIDI files. If you save a file as a MIDI file, the
Key+ transposition will be applied to each note event, so that the file will sound the same, but the Key+ information will be lost. If
you're reading in a MIDI file, you can easily set up the non-concert instrument tracks and then save the file as a normal project file.
First set the Key+ offset to reflect the non-concert instrument's key signature. Then, use Transpose to compensate for the Key+
offset.

Working with lyrics
Cakewalk lets you create, edit, and display lyrics, the words and syllables associated with notes in a track. Lyrics can be the words
to a song, the text of a vocal passage, a narration to be read along with the music, cues of some type, or text totally unrelated to the
music. Each word or syllable in the lyrics must be associated with a note in a MIDI track. Each MIDI track can have its own lyrics.
Although lyrics can logically be associated with digital audio data, you cannot actually place lyrics in an audio track. If you want to
create lyrics for an audio track, you must create an auxiliary MIDI track to hold the lyrics.
You can enter and edit lyrics in several ways:

 Using the Lyrics mode in the Staff view
 Using the Lyrics view
 Inserting lyric events in the Event List view
The Staff view is usually the preferred location for entering lyrics, since you can see the notes with which the lyrics are associated.
The Lyrics view can also be used for entering or editing lyrics, but its main strength is that it can display lyrics in a larger, more
readable format. You might use the Lyrics view to display song lyrics during recording and playback, so performers can see the
words and sing along. You can make the font size in the Lyrics view as large as desired, so that the lyrics can be read at a distance
from the monitor. During playback, the current line in the lyrics is enclosed in a box and the current word is highlighted.
Lyric events are similar to text events. Like any other event, they occur at a particular time. They contain text, just like generalpurpose text events, but generally they contain only a single word (or syllable of a word). As events, Lyrics can be edited in the Event
List view (see “The Event List view” on page 887).
See:
“Adding and editing lyrics in the Staff view” on page 1306
“Opening the Lyrics view” on page 1307
“Adding and editing lyrics in the Lyrics view” on page 1308

Adding and editing lyrics in the Staff view
The Staff view displays lyrics below their associated track. If the track is split into treble/bass staves, lyrics are aligned with notes in
both staves, but are displayed below the treble staff.
When a lyric word or syllable spans multiple notes, a trailing underline or series of regularly spaced hyphens is automatically drawn,
following conventional lyric notation practice.

To add lyrics to a track
1. Select the Draw Freehand tool in the Control Bar.
2. Click the Lyrics button

in the Staff view.

3. Position the pointer below the staff, under the first note to be assigned lyrics. (The pointer changes to a pencil when you are in a
legal position.)

Adding and editing lyrics in the Lyrics view
Lyrics appear in the Lyrics view as a stream of syllables, each one associated with a note in the track. In this context, a syllable is
any continuous string of characters, without a hyphen. For example, “love,” “desire,” and “infatuation” are all syllables; each one
would be associated with a single note. If you want to break a word into multiple syllables, you must hyphenate the word. For
example, “de-sire” would map onto two notes, since it is now two syllables long.
When you enter the lyrics, you can mark the syllables the way you want, or you can simply type the text in normally and use
automatic hyphenation to break the text into syllables. This means that you can add lyrics to a project by copying and pasting them
from another application (such as a word processor), and then hyphenate them automatically.
To extend a single syllable over more than one note, you can use extra hyphens, separated by spaces. For example, in “Oh-say can
you see…”, the “Oh” is extended over two notes. If a track contains no lyrics yet, the display will show only a series of hyphens (one
for each note in the track).
If you enter more syllables than there are notes in the track, Cakewalk assigns the extra lyrics times at quarter note intervals.

To enter lyrics in the Lyrics view
1. Click in the upper left corner of the view to position the cursor at the start of the text.
2. Follow the instructions in the table:
To do this

Do this

Enter a word or syllable

Type it

End a word or syllable and move to the next note

Type a space or hyphen

Press ENTER

To edit lyrics in the Lyrics view
Editing in the Lyrics view follows standard Windows conventions for cursor movement, selection, cut (CTRL+X), copy (CTRL+C),
paste (CTRL+V), and delete (DELETE). When you pause, Cakewalk will update all Lyric events in the track.

To hyphenate the lyrics
1. If you want, select a portion of the lyric text. If you do not select any text, all the lyrics will be hyphenated.
2. Click the Lyrics view Font menu and choose Hyphenate.
Cakewalk hyphenates the lyrics.

Instrument definitions

Instrument definitions are a powerful feature of Cakewalk that makes it easier for you to find the banks, patches, and controllers of
your MIDI instruments. An instrument definition is a file that contains the names of the banks, patches, note names, bank select
method, and controllers of an instrument. Instrument definitions for many popular MIDI instruments are included with Cakewalk or
are available on the Cakewalk website (www.cakewalk.com). If an instrument definition is not available for your instrument, and you
are familiar with MIDI and how it works, you can use Cakewalk to create your own instrument definition.
Most MIDI instruments available today are General MIDI (GM) compatible, which means that they come with the standard set of
sounds or patches defined by the GM standard. Cakewalk initially assumes that your MIDI instruments are GM compatible. The
names of patches and controllers that you initially see displayed throughout Cakewalk are drawn from the GM specification.
At the same time, many MIDI instruments provide additional sounds and controllers beyond those required by the GM standard. In
addition, some older MIDI instruments are not GM compatible. If you are using one of these instruments with Cakewalk, you can use
instrument definitions to make sure that the names of banks, patches, and controllers that you see in Cakewalk are the same ones
you see on the display screens of your MIDI keyboards and modules.

Assigning instruments
Cakewalk lets you assign a MIDI instrument definition to each available MIDI output and channel. The assignments you make
determine the MIDI bank names, patch names, note names, and controller names that you see during your Cakewalk session.
Suppose that you have a Roland GS-compatible synthesizer attached to MIDI output 1. By assigning all 16 channels of MIDI output
1 to the Roland GS instrument definition, you ensure that the bank, patch, note, and controller name lists you see displayed in
Cakewalk are the same ones that you see on the display screen of your synthesizer.
Often, you want to assign a different instrument to channel 10, which is usually used for percussion. For example, you might assign
the Roland GS instrument definition to channels 1 through 9 and 11 through 16, but you would most likely want to assign the Roland
GS Drumsets instrument definition to channel 10. That way, any Cakewalk tracks you assign to channel 10 on that output use the
names of drum sets for patch names, and drum notation in the Piano Roll view. If you have several MIDI outputs, with a different
MIDI module attached to each one, you would normally assign a different instrument definition to each MIDI output.
For convenience, you can assign a block of channels to one instrument and then change the assignment of one or more of those
channels without changing the others. For example, you can highlight all 16 channels of the first MIDI output and assign them to the
Roland GS instrument definition. Then, you can highlight channel 10 of that same MIDI output and assign it to the Roland GS
Drumset instrument definition. Channels 1 through 9 and 11 through 16 on the first MIDI output will stay assigned to Roland GS.
If you only have one MIDI output, but have several MIDI modules attached to it, you can assign a few channels to each module. For
example, you might have a Roland synth receiving on MIDI channels 1 through 9, a Roland drum machine receiving on channel 10,
and a basic GM-compatible synth receiving on channels 11 through 16. In this case, you’d use three different instrument definitions
for your one and only MIDI output.

To assign instrument definitions to MIDI outputs and channels
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Instruments.
Figure 560. The Instruments section.

2. Select one or more MIDI outputs and channels from the Output/Channel list (use SHIFT-click and CTRL-click to select multiple
outputs and channels). You can also drag through a bunch of channels to select them. For example, if you want to assign the first
16 MIDI channels on output 1 to a certain MIDI module, drag through the first 16 items in the Output/Channel list to select them.
3. Choose the instrument definition to which the selected outputs and channels should be assigned from the Uses Instrument list. A
black line connects the two lists. If your MIDI module’s name doesn’t appear in the list and you don’t want to use General MIDI
bank and patch names for it, see “Importing instrument definitions” on page 1311.
4. To save these changes permanently, select the Save Changes for Next Session check box.
5. Click OK to apply your changes.
From now on, the bank, patch, controller, and note names from the assigned instrument definition are used throughout Cakewalk on
any track that uses one of the output/channel combinations you selected in the Output/Channel list.

Assigning instruments

To clear instrument assignments
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Instruments.
2. Select the MIDI outputs and channels whose assignments you want to remove from the Output/Channel list.
3. Choose <default> from the Uses Instrument list. A black line connects the two lists.
4. Click OK when you are done.
You don’t really clear instrument assignments—you reassign them to use the default (General MIDI) instrument definition. After you
reassign the output/channel combinations, the default (GM) bank, patch, controller, and note names are used throughout Cakewalk
on any track that uses one of the output/channel combinations you reassigned in the Output/Channel list.

Importing instrument definitions
When you install Cakewalk, a few common instrument definitions are already set up for you and ready to use. Cakewalk also
includes several hundred additional instrument definitions that you can import.
These instrument definitions are stored in text files in your Cakewalk folder, organized largely by manufacturer. For example, all the
instrument definitions for Roland gear are stored in the Roland.ins file; all the instrument definitions for Yamaha gear are stored in
the Yamaha.ins file. The Misc.ins file contains miscellaneous instrument definitions.
If Cakewalk does not include an instrument definition for your MIDI instrument, you can find additional and updated instrument
definitions on the Downloads section of the Cakewalk website (www.cakewalk.com). Simply download the files to your Cakewalk
folder, unzip if necessary, and import the instrument definitions as described in “To import instrument definitions” on page 1311.
When you import an instrument definition, it is added to the master instrument definition file Master.ins. The contents of this file
determines the list of instruments that appear in the Assign Instruments dialog box.

To import instrument definitions
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Instruments.
2. Click Define to display the Define Instruments and Names dialog box.
3. Click Import to display the Import Instrument Definitions dialog box.
4. Choose the file that contains instrument definitions for your manufacturer, and click Open. Cakewalk displays a list of all the
instrument definitions in the file.
5. Choose one or more instruments from the list, and click OK.
6. Click Close to close the Define Instruments and Names dialog box.
The instrument definitions you imported should now appear in the Uses Instrument list in the Assign Instruments dialog box.

Creating instrument definitions
Cakewalk lets you create and edit instrument definitions. To create an instrument definition, you must answer these types of
questions:

 What are the names of the patches in each bank?
 Which note names should be used for each patch?
 What are the names of the MIDI Controllers for this instrument?
 Which RPN and NRPNs are available on the instrument?
 Which Bank Select method does the instrument use?
To collect this information, you need the MIDI documentation for your instrument.
Here’s a general outline of the steps you must follow to create an instrument definition:

 Create a new instrument in the Instrument tree.
 Create any new name lists in the Names tree that are required for the instrument.
 Drag name lists and possibly a bank select method to the new instrument from the Names tree.
 Close the Define Instruments and Names dialog box.
For detailed instructions, see “To create a new instrument” on page 1313.
You define instruments in the Define Instruments and Names dialog box, shown in the following figure.
Figure 561. The Define Instruments and Names dialog box.
A

B

A. The Instruments tree B. The Names tree

The Define Instruments and Names dialog box contains two trees:

 The Instruments tree in the left half of the dialog box lists all defined instruments and their characteristics
 The Names tree in the right half of the dialog box shows all the resources you use to define an instrument
You expand or collapse the folders and lists in each tree by clicking on the + or - key shown to the left of each item. You can also
right-click on an item and choose Expand or Collapse from the menu, or double-click on an item to expand or collapse it.
To define an instrument, you drag resources from the Names tree to the name of an instrument on the Instruments tree. Each
resource is color-coded—you can only drag a Names list to an Instrument tree branch of the same color. For example, you can only
drag a list from the Patch Names folder in the Names tree to a Patch Names for Banks folder in the Instruments tree.

1312

Instrument definitions
Creating instrument definitions

There are six components to an instrument definition:

 Method for bank selection
 Patch names, such as Piano and Bass
 Note names, which are most frequently used to name drum notes, such as kick or snare
 Controller names, like volume and pan
 Names for Registered Parameter Numbers (RPNs)
 Names for Non-Registered Parameter Numbers (NRPNs)
The instrument definitions organize all names (patches, notes, controllers, RPNs, and NRPNs) into lists. You may be able to define
a new instrument using existing name lists. For example, two models of synthesizers made by a particular manufacturer may have
identical patch name lists but use different NRPNs. In this case, you can use the same patch name lists for both instruments, but you
would need to use a different NRPN list (or perhaps create a new NRPN list) for the second synth.
If you want your changes to be remembered the next time you run Cakewalk, make sure the Save Changes For Next Session
option in the Assign Instruments dialog box is checked before clicking OK. Otherwise, to make only temporary changes, be sure to
remove the check from that option.

To create a new instrument
1. In the Define Instruments and Names dialog box, right-click the word Instruments at the top of the Instrument tree, and
choose Add Instrument from the pop-up menu.
2. Type a name for the new instrument and press ENTER.
The new instrument is provided with default settings for all of its characteristics.

To rename an instrument
1. In the Define Instruments and Names dialog box, right-click an Instrument name in the Instrument tree and choose Edit from
the pop-up menu.
2. Type the new name and press ENTER.

To delete an instrument
1. In the Define Instruments and Names dialog box, right-click an Instrument name in the Instrument tree and choose Delete
from the menu.
2. Confirm that you want to delete the instrument.

To save an instrument definition
1. Click Close to close the Define Instruments and Names dialog box.
2. Click OK.
Cakewalk saves the instrument definition in the Master.ins file.

To export an instrument definition
1. In the Define Instruments and Names dialog box, right-click an Instrument name in the Instrument tree and choose Export
from the menu to display the Export Instrument Definition dialog box.
2. If you don’t want to save the file in the folder that’s listed in the Save In field, navigate to the folder in which you do want to save
the file.
3. Enter a file name and click Save.
Cakewalk saves the file, with the filename extension .ins.
Note: Exporting instrument definitions allows you to share them with other Cakewalk users.

To reload instrument definitions
Users of MIDI librarian programs need the ability to update Cakewalk’s instrument definitions in real-time, without having to close
and restart Cakewalk.
When the Reset (Panic) button
is pressed, Cakewalk closes and reopens the instrument manager to reload settings from
Master.ins and Instrmap.ini.
Any changes made to patch names or other instrument definitions are reflected immediately.

Creating and editing patch name and other lists
You can create and edit the various lists in the Names tree that make up each instrument definition. Patch name, note name, and
controller name lists can contain up to 128 entries, numbered 0 through 127. RPN and NRPN name lists can contain up to 16,384
entries, numbered 0 through 16,383.

To create and edit name lists
 To create, edit, or work with name lists, go to the Names tree of the Define Instruments and Names dialog box, and follow the
directions in the following table.
To do this

Do this

Create a new name list

Duplicate an existing Patch Names or other list by doing one of the following: expand the folder that contains
the name list, highlight the name list and press the Ins (Insert) key; highlight the folder and press
SHIFT+INSERT; or right-click any folder or name list and choose Add Names List from the menu.
Then type a name for the list and press ENTER.

Delete a name list

Highlight the names list and press the DELETE key; or right-click on the name list and choose Delete from
the menu. You will see a warning if the list is used by any instrument definition. If you delete the list anyway,
the instrument definition will change automatically.

Add the next item in a name list

Highlight a name and press the Ins key, or right-click on a name and choose Add Name from the menu.
Then enter the name.

Add a name anywhere in a list

Highlight the name of a list and press SHIFT+INSERT, or right-click on the name of a list and choose Add
Name from the menu. Then enter the name.

Delete names from a list

Highlight the Names List or Name, and press DELETE. You can also right-click, then choose Delete.

Edit a name in a list

Highlight the name or name list and press F2, or right-click and choose Edit from the menu. Then enter the
new name.

“Assigning controller, RPN, and NRPN names” on page 1319

Copying name lists
You can easily create new lists that are similar to other lists. For example, suppose you want to create a new patch name list called
NewList that is almost identical to the General MIDI patch list, but with one or two small changes. Here’s how you proceed:

 Create a new patch name list in the Patch Names folder of the Names tree called, for example, NewList.
 Drag the new list onto the General MIDI list in the Names tree. You will be asked if you want to base NewList on the General
MIDI list.

 Click OK. NewList will now be listed under the General MIDI branch. Any patch names that exist in the General MIDI list apply to
NewList, too.

 Add new patch names to NewList. These names will override those in the list on which NewList is based.
If you change your mind about NewList and want to make it a stand-alone, separate list, simply drag it to the Patch Names root
folder.

Assigning the Bank Select method
Your synthesizer uses one of four bank select methods to switch back and forth between banks of sounds. To find the method used
for your instrument, check the instrument’s User’s Guide or the manufacturer’s website. The four methods are as follows:
Method

Used for

Normal

Instruments that respond to Controller 0 or Controller 32 bank select messages

Controller 0 only

Instruments that only respond to Controller 0 bank select messages

Controller 32 only

Instruments that only respond to Controller 32 bank select messages

Patch 100...127

Instruments that let you change banks by sending patch changes between 100 and 127

The bank select method you choose affects the bank numbers that you assign to each patch list, as described in the following
section. Here’s how you compute the bank numbers:
Bank select method

To compute the bank number

Normal

Take the value of Controller 0, multiply it by 128, and add the value of Controller 32 to derive the bank number.
Note: A synthesizer manufacturer may refer to Controller 0 as the MSB (Most Significant Byte) and to Controller
32 as the LSB (Least Significant Byte).

Controller 0 only

The value of Controller 0 is the bank number.

Controller 32 only

The value of Controller 32 is the bank number.

Patch 100...127

Take the patch number and subtract 100 to derive the bank number.

Here is an example of the Normal bank select method. According to the documentation for the Roland JV-1080 synthesizer, the PRA Bank has a Controller 0 value of 81 and a Controller 32 value of 0. You compute the bank number that you enter in the instrument
definition as follows: (81 × 128) + 0 = 10,368.

To change the Bank Select method
1. Highlight and expand the instrument in the Instrument tree.
2. Expand the Bank Select Method branch in the Names tree.
3. Drag the desired bank select method from the Names tree to the Instrument tree.

Creating instrument definitions

Assigning patch names
A MIDI instrument can have up to 16,384 banks of 128 patches each. Patches can have names, like “Piano” for patch number 0,
“Bass” for patch number 1, and so on. Normally, each bank contains a different set of patches, so each bank needs a separate patch
name list. Most synthesizers start with a patch number of 0.
You can assign a patch name list to each bank. You can also assign a default patch name list to the instrument, which is used for all
banks for which you haven’t assigned a specific list. The previous section describes how to compute the bank numbers to which
each patch name list is assigned.
Each bank can also be assigned a special Drum flag, which indicates that all patches in that bank contain drum sounds. If you set
this flag, the Piano Roll view will display drum notes as diamonds, and the Staff view will use percussion notation.

To see the assignment of patch name lists to banks
1. Expand the instrument definition by clicking the + sign next to the instrument name.
2. Expand the Patch Names for Banks folder by clicking the + sign. The list expands to show the bank numbers and the patch name
list that is assigned to each bank.
B

C
A
D

A. There are three defined banks B. Instrument name C. The * indicates that this patch list is the default D. This is the name of a patch name list

To add a bank or change the patch names for a bank
1. Drag a patch name list from the Names tree to the Patch Names for Banks folder of the instrument you’re editing in the
Instrument tree.
2. Enter a bank number, or enter -1 to indicate that this list of patch names should be used as the default.
Cakewalk displays the updated banks and patch name lists. If necessary, Cakewalk adds a new bank to the instrument definition.

To remove a bank or patch name list
1. In the Instrument tree in the Patch Names for Banks folder of the instrument you’re editing, highlight the bank and patch
names list.
2. Press the DELETE key, or right-click on the bank name and choose Delete from the pop-up menu.

To set or clear the Drum flag
 Right-click on the bank in the Instrument tree, and choose Drums from the pop-up menu.

Assigning note names
Each patch may have a list of up to 128 names for notes. Usually, note names are labels for percussion instruments. For example,
the pitch C3 may really be “Kick Drum,” and D3 may be “Snare.” Because a drum machine may provide different drum kits for each
patch, Cakewalk lets you specify a different list of note names for each patch. The Piano Roll and Event List views show you these
note names.
You can assign a note name list to each patch. You can also assign a default note name list to the instrument, which is used for all
patches for which you haven’t assigned a specific note name list.
Each patch can also be assigned a special Drum flag, which indicates that this patch contains drum sounds. If you set this flag, the
Piano Roll view will display drum notes as diamonds, and the Staff view will use percussion notation.
There are several standard note name lists provided with Cakewalk:
Note name list

Contents

0...127

The numbers 0 through 127

Diatonic

The default MIDI note names (like C4, E5, and so on)

General MIDI Drums

The default instrument names for the General MIDI drum patch

To see the assignment of note name lists to patches
1. Expand the instrument definition by clicking the + sign next to the instrument name.
2. Expand the Patch Names for Banks folder by clicking the + sign.
3. Continue expanding the tree by clicking the + sign, until the tree is fully expanded.
D

C
B
E

A

A. This is the name of a note name list B. The * indicates that this note name list is the default C. Bank D. Instrument name E. Note name lists are
defined for three different patches

To change the note names for a patch
1. Drag a note name list from the Names tree onto the Note Names for Patches folder of the instrument and bank you’re editing in
the Instruments tree.
2. Enter the patch number that should use these note names, or enter -1 to indicate that this list of note names should be used as
the default.
Cakewalk displays the updated patch and note name lists. If necessary, Cakewalk adds a new patch to the instrument definition.

To remove a note name list
1. In the Instrument tree in the Note Names for Patches folder of the instrument you’re editing, highlight the name of the note
names list (for example, “diatonic”).
2. Press the DELETE key, or right-click on the note name list and choose Delete from the pop-up menu.

Assigning controller, RPN, and NRPN names
Cakewalk lets each instrument have its own lists of controller names, RPN names, and NRPN names. There is always exactly one
list of each type per instrument.

To see the controller, RPN, and NRPN name lists
 Expand the instrument definition by clicking the PLUS (+) sign next to the instrument name.
A

B
C
D

A. Instrument name B. Controller name list C. RPN name list D. NRPN name list

To change the controller, RPN, or NRPN name list
1. In the Names tree, expand the branch containing the Controller name lists, RPN name lists, or NRPN name lists.
2. Drag the desired name list from the Names tree onto the corresponding branch of the Instrument tree.
Cakewalk displays the updated Controller, RPN, or NRPN name lists.

Cakewalk flags in instrument definitions
Cakewalk has several flags that you can use in instrument definition files for use with specific instrument definitions.

UsesNotesAsControllers=n
Some MIDI devices, certain mixers for example, use MIDI Note events instead of Continuous Controller events for automation. It is
often desirable to treat the Note events as Controller events in order for them to obey the Zero Controllers When Play Stops and
Patch/Controller Searchback Before Play Starts settings.
You can enter this variable in any instrument definition by using a text editor, such as Windows Notepad. The variable should be
entered directly below an instrument definition. For example:
[Mackie OTTO-1604]
UsesNotesAsControllers=1
Control=Mackie OTTO-1604
Patch[*]=Mackie OTTO-1604
Key[*,*]=Mackie OTTO-1604

NoControllerReset=n
Any port/channel using an instrument definition that has a NoControllerReset flag set to 1 does not receive a "zero controller"
message upon stop. You can enter this variable in any instrument definition by using a text editor, such as Windows Notepad. The
variable should be entered directly below an instrument definition. For example:
[Yamaha Promix 01 Control Chan]
NoControllerReset=1
Control=Yamaha Promix 01 Control Chan
Patch[*]=Yamaha Pro Mix 01
This parameter should be used when it is undesirable to zero/reset controllers when playback stop, such as when using an external
effects processor that uses MIDI controllers for real-time parameter control, or when using a digital mixer as a MIDI control surface
(and not using the generic control surface plug-in).

Creating instrument definitions

Instrument definition tutorial
The following tutorial takes you through the process of setting up an instrument definition for a Roland keyboard so that the bank and
patch names, including any self-created sounds, read the same in Cakewalk as they do on the display screen of your keyboard
instrument.
Next topic: “Why use instrument definitions?” on page 1321

Why use instrument definitions?
The main reason to import or create an instrument definition is so you can use patch names that are specific to the MIDI module
you’re using, instead of using generic General MIDI patch names. It’s much easier to find a particular sound on a MIDI module when
the actual names of the patches in the current bank of sounds pop up on a list, instead of just the numbers 0 to 127, or General MIDI
names like Trumpet. Of course, if you’re only using General MIDI modules, General MIDI patch names might be all you need. You
can also rename each MIDI output with the name of the MIDI module it’s connected to. For example, it might be more meaningful to
name a MIDI output Roland Sound Canvas instead of MOTU MIDI Express 5. That way, you won’t have to remember that you
connected the Sound Canvas to the MOTU MIDI Express output number 5—the name Sound Canvas shows up as an option in the
Output field of each MIDI track in Cakewalk’s Track view. Also if you have an effects processor or module that’s hard to get to in
your studio, you may find it convenient to control it from Cakewalk.
Next topic: “What can they do and not do?” on page 1321

What can they do and not do?
Instrument definitions don’t increase the number of sounds or the capabilities of your modules, they just make it easier to find and
remember the sounds and/or MIDI controllers you want to use, if they’re not all generic General MIDI items. After you define an
instrument, Cakewalk displays the names that you choose for the sounds in each of that instrument’s banks, rather than displaying
the same 128 General MIDI names over and over for each bank of sounds.
Next topic: “Where do instrument definitions come from?” on page 1321

Where do instrument definitions come from?
The patch names and other characteristics of each particular MIDI module are supplied by the manufacturer, and are contained in an
instrument definition file, which is a text file written in a format Cakewalk can read. Many of these files come with Cakewalk, and
many more are available at Cakewalk’s website, and also at www.lilchips.com. Instrument definition files have the extension .ins and
can contain a definition for only one instrument, or definitions for several instruments. For example, the file Roland.ins contains
definitions for many Roland modules. The file Misc.ins contains miscellaneous definitions that might include your instrument if you
don’t see a specific file for it. You can find these files in your Cakewalk folder. The file Master.ins contains all the instrument
definitions currently loaded into Cakewalk, and determines the list of instruments that appears in the Assign Instruments dialog
box.

Start of tutorial
Let’s say you have a Roland XP-10 and you want Cakewalk to display all of its patch names from all of its banks, including any selfcreated sounds you add to it.
Let’s start by importing the names of the built-in banks and patches that the XP-10 has.

To import a Roland instrument definition
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Instruments.
2. Click Define to display the Define Instruments and Names dialog box.
3. Click Import to display the Import Instrument Definitions dialog box.
4. Choose the file that contains instrument definitions for your manufacturer, which in this case is the Roland.ins file, and click
Open. Cakewalk displays a list of all the instrument definitions in the file.
5. Scroll down the list, select Roland XP-10, and click OK.
6. Click Close to close the Define Instruments and Names dialog box.
The instrument definition you imported should now appear in the Uses Instrument list in the Assign Instruments dialog box.
When you import an instrument definition, it is added to the master instrument definition file Master.ins. The contents of this file
determines the list of instruments that appear in the Assign Instruments dialog box.
Now let’s assign the XP-10 definition to some channels on a MIDI output:

To assign the Roland XP-10 bank and patch names to a MIDI output
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Instruments.
2. Let’s assign all 16 MIDI channels on output 1 to use the XP-10 bank and patch names:

 Drag through the first 16 items in the Port/Channel list to select them.
 From the Uses Instrument list, click Roland XP-10. A black line connects the two lists.
3. To save these changes permanently, enable the Save Changes for Next Session option.
4. Click OK to apply your changes.
From now on, any track that uses any of channels 1 to 16 on output 1 displays bank and patch names from the XP-10.
To check this, assign a MIDI track in a project to Ch 1, assign the Output field to 1-Roland XP-10, and then examine the drop-down
lists in the Bank and Patch fields of the track. You should see bank and patch names that are specific to the Roland XP-10.
Let’s check some of our bank and patch lists to see if they match up with what we see on the screen of the XP-10. On the XP-10,
let’s look at the Vari 1 bank: if we look at tone (tone means the same as patch) #005 in the Vari 1 bank on the XP-10, we see that it
is called Detuned EP1. If we change the bank on a MIDI track to 128-Roland XP-10 Var #01, and look at the menu of patches in the
Pch field, we see that there is no name listed for patch #004 (Roland numbers its patches from 1 to 128; Cakewalk numbers patches
from 0 to 127, so patch #004 in Cakewalk is the same patch number as patch #005 on the Roland). Let’s look at some of the other
Roland XP-10 patch name lists in the right window of the Define Instruments and Names dialog box to see if another one has the
right patch names in it, and rename it Var #01.

To substitute and rename a patch list
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Instruments and click the Define button to open the Define Instruments and Names dialog
box.
2. In the Names Tree window on the right, click the + sign on the Patches folder to expand the tree of patch name lists.
3. Scroll down to the Roland XP-10 Var #08 list and click its + sign to expand it.
4. Compare the names on the Var #08 list with the patch names of the Vari 1 instruments on the Roland’s display screen. You’ll see
they are the same.
5. Let’s substitute the Var #08 list for the Var #01 list that Cakewalk currently lists as the XP-10’s second bank, which has a bank
change number of 128:
1. In the Instruments tree in the left window, click the Roland XP-10 entry to expand it, and then expand the Patch Names for
Banks list that’s directly under it.
2. Expand the Patch Names tree in the right window and find the Roland XP-10 Var #01 list (if there is one) and right-click it to
display the pop-up menu.
3. Choose Edit from the pop-up menu, and change the name from Roland XP-10 Var #01 to Roland XP-10 Var #011.

1322

Instrument definitions
Instrument definition tutorial

4. In the same tree find the Roland XP-10 Var #08 list and change the name from Roland XP-10 Var #08 to Roland XP-10 Var
#01.
5. Drag the newly renamed list from the Patch Names tree in the right window to the Patch Names for Banks tree in the left
window.
6. In the Bank Number dialog box, enter 128, and click OK.
6. Click the Close button to close the Define Instruments and Names dialog box and click OK to close the Assign Instruments
and Names dialog box.
Examine the new bank and patch data in a track that uses 1-Roland XP-10 as an output. In the Bnk field, select 128 Roland XP-10
Var #01, then look at the drop-down list of patches in the Pch field. The list should now have the same names that the Roland
keyboard uses for its Vari 1 bank.
The Roland XP-10, like most MIDI keyboards, allows you to create your own sounds and store them in one or more User banks. You
can create patch name lists in Cakewalk that are the same as the names you gave to each of your own sounds.

Checking bank numbers
You can calculate bank numbers by using the methods described in “Assigning the Bank Select method” on page 1316, but you
might find it easier to use the following method:

To check the bank numbers
1. Set up a MIDI track to record from your MIDI keyboard or module.
2. Click the Record button to start recording, and change banks on your keyboard.
3. Stop recording, and open the Event List view.
4. The bank change you recorded is displayed in the Event List view in this way: in the Data column you’ll see what kind of bank
change method your keyboard uses (probably Normal), and in the column to the right of that data is the number of the bank you
changed to.
When we changed the Roland XP-10 to the User 1 bank, we recorded a bank number of 8192.

To create a patch name list for your own sounds
1. You could create a new list by copying and renaming an existing list (right-click a list and choose New Patch Name List from the
pop-up menu), but since the instrument definition we imported for the XP-10 includes a list called Roland XP-10 User Tone 1,
let’s just edit that one: in the Names Tree window on the right, right-click the Roland XP-10 User Tone 1 list and choose Add
Patch Name from the pop-up menu.
A new patch field appears, with the text 0=0 inside.
2. Replace the first number in the Patch field with the number of a patch you stored in User Bank 1 on the Roland.
3. Replace the second number in the Patch field with the name you made up for the patch you just gave a number to, and press
ENTER.
4. Assign names to as many patch numbers as you want—the numbers between 0 and 127 that you don’t assign any names to
show up in the Track view Patch menu just as patch numbers with no other names.
5. When you finish assigning names, drag your edited patch list to the Roland XP-10 Patch Names for Banks tree in the left
window.
6. Enter 8192 as the bank number, which we know is the correct bank number from the previous procedure.
7. Click the Close button to close the Define Instruments and Names dialog box and click OK to close the Assign Instruments
and Names dialog box.
Now you can select the 8192-Roland XP-10 User Tone 1 bank in the Bank field of a MIDI track, and then examine the patch list in
the Patch menu: you should see the patch list that you just created.

System exclusive data

Cakewalk’s System Exclusive (Sysx) librarian provides you with 8192 banks in which to hold MIDI System Exclusive messages. A
bank is a storage area plus some associated parameters such as a destination output and an optional description. Each bank can
hold any number of messages; the amount of data it can hold is limited only by available memory. The banks are saved in the
Cakewalk project file. Each bank can also be saved as a .syx file.

What is System Exclusive?
System Exclusive data is MIDI’s way of letting each synthesizer manufacturer transmit private data about its products. A System
Exclusive message has a manufacturer ID; the rest of the message is completely proprietary and varies for each manufacturer, even
for each of its products. Cakewalk does not understand what this data means; it simply can hold onto it for you. You can take
snapshots of your equipment’s configuration and store them in Cakewalk’s System Exclusive banks for transmitting back to the
equipment. You may want to do this simply to back up your equipment’s patches and/or settings, much like backing up your
computer’s hard drive in case something goes wrong. Or you may configure your equipment differently for each project’s
requirements, which is why storing System Exclusive banks with each Cakewalk project file can be useful. Of course, for merely
backing up your equipment, you can have a project containing only System Exclusive data and no notes.

“Troubleshooting” on page 1333

Sysx events
Cakewalk provides two distinct kinds of Sysx events: Sysx Bank and Sysx Data.

 Sysx Bank: You can use Sysx Bank events to transmit one of the project’s 8192 banks of System Exclusive data. These banks
can be recorded, viewed, and edited in the Sysx view, and each bank can contain one or more very large System Exclusive
messages. Sysx Banks may also be marked Auto, so that they are sent when the file is loaded rather than during the start of
playback.

 Sysx Data: You can also use Sysx Data events, which can each contain a single System Exclusive message up to 255 bytes
long. You can view the message bytes in the Event List view.
Sysx Data events can be recorded in real time. See “Real-time recording of System Exclusive messages” on page 1332 for more
information.

What is System Exclusive?

Using the System Exclusive view
The System Exclusive view has a list box for a maximum of 256 Sysx banks, plus a toolbar of buttons. Most of the buttons affect
whatever bank you have selected in the list. Certain buttons will be disabled if the selected bank is empty. To open the System
Exclusive view, click the Views menu and choose Sysx, or press ALT+SHIFT+7.
Cakewalk stores Sysx messages as either Sysx banks or Sysx data. The main difference is in the number of bytes in the message,
and also that Sysx data is only visible in the Event List view as SysxData events. A Sysx data message can have up to 255 bytes in
it. You can send Sysx data to an instrument without interrupting playback (depending on the speed of your computer and the number
of bytes in the message), however, sending a Sysx bank stops playback until all of the Sysx bank is transmitted. Sysx banks are
usually sent to your instrument when you load your work file. Cakewalk asks you each time you load a project file if you want to send
any existing Sysx banks the file contains that are marked for auto-sending. To mark or unmark the selected bank for auto-sending,
click the Settings menu and choose Auto Send on/off.
For more information, see:
“Importing, creating, and dumping Sysx banks” on page 1328
“Editing Sysx banks” on page 1330
“Sending Sysx banks at startup” on page 1327
“Real-time recording of System Exclusive messages” on page 1332
“Transmitting banks during playback” on page 1331
“Sysx view menu” on page 1330

Sending Sysx banks at startup
You can tell Cakewalk to send certain Sysx banks to your instrument(s) each time you open the project file that the banks are in.

To send Sysx banks at startup
1. In the Sysx view, select a bank that you want to send to an instrument when you open the current project.
Cakewalk highlights the bank you select.
2. Click the Sysx view Settings menu and choose Auto Send on/off.
A check mark appears next to the bank name in the Auto column to show that the bank is marked for auto-sending.
3. While the bank is still highlighted, click the Settings menu and choose Output to open the Sysx Bank Output dialog box.
4. Enter the number of the output you want to send this bank out through, and click OK.
The output number you entered appears next to the selected bank in the Output column.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each bank you want to send, and save your project.
The next time you open a project, Cakewalk asks you if you want to send any Sysx banks in the project that are marked for autosending. If you click OK, Cakewalk sends the bank(s).
If you want Cakewalk to send auto-send banks every time you open a project without asking you, clear the Ask this question every
time check box in the Auto-Send Sysx dialog box. If you decide later that you want to be asked, go to Edit > Preferences > File Advanced and select the Ask Before Sending System Exclusive (When Opening Projects) check box.

Importing, creating, and dumping Sysx banks
There are several ways to get a sysx bank into Cakewalk:

 You can import (load) an external .syx file.
 You can edit an empty bank to create a new bank from scratch.
 You can dump a bank into Cakewalk from the synthesizer itself.
To import a Sysx bank into a project
1. In the Sysx view, select an empty bank to import the new bank into (unless you want to add to or overwrite an existing bank).
2. Click the Sysx view File menu and choose Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
3. If necessary, navigate to the folder that contains your .syx files, select the one you want to import, and click Open.
The file appears as a new bank in the row you selected in the Sysx view. If you want Cakewalk to send this bank every time you
open this project, make sure the bank is selected (highlighted), then click the Sysx view Settings menu and choose Auto Send on/
off. A check mark appears in the Auto column next to all auto-send-enabled banks.

To create a Sysx bank
1. In the Sysx view, select an empty bank, then click the Edit menu and choose Edit Data (or double-click the empty bank).
The Edit System Exclusive Bytes dialog box appears.
2. Type your message(s). Each message you add to the window must begin with F0 and end with F7 (that’s F zero and F seven).
See your instrument’s manual for the messages you can create.
3. When you finish typing the message(s), click OK to close the dialog box.
After you close the editing window, your new bank appears in the Sysx view. Use the buttons in the toolbar to name it, give it an
output number, and mark it for auto-sending, if you want. Save your project when you’re finished.

To dump a Sysx bank into Cakewalk
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Playback and Recording and make sure the System Exclusive check box is selected. If it
isn’t, Cakewalk won’t receive System Exclusive messages.
2. In the Sysx view, select an empty bank to dump the new bank into (unless you want to add to or overwrite an existing bank).
3. Click the Sysx view File menu and choose Receive.
The Receive System Exclusive dialog box appears, which contains a list of Dump Request Macros (DRMs). Each DRM has a
name that describes the synthesizer the DRM controls and the type of data that the DRM asks the synthesizer to send.
4. Do one of the following:

 If the name of your instrument and the kind of data you want to store in Cakewalk appears in the list, select your choice and
click OK.

 If your instrument and the type of data you want to record are not in the list, select You start dump on instrument, click OK, and
press whatever button on your synthesizer that starts a Sysx bank dump. The You start dump on instrument option is not
really a Dump Request Macro. It tells Cakewalk that you will initiate a dump (or multiple dumps) from the front panel of the
synthesizer.

1328

System exclusive data
Importing, creating, and dumping Sysx banks

5. The DRM may prompt you for additional information, which you should supply.

 Patch number: DRMs that are written to request an individual patch or configuration give you this prompt, so you can specify
the one you want to have dumped.

 Channel/unit number: Most synthesizers have a Sysx channel or unit number. This covers the situation in which you own
two of the exact same synthesizer, and want to do Sysx with each independently. Your synthesizer manual should describe
the factory-set number.

When your instrument starts sending the bank, the Sysx Receive window counts the bytes as Cakewalk receives them. If the
count stays at zero for more than a couple of seconds, something is wrong. The synthesizer may not be hooked up to the MIDI
interface in both directions, or you may have answered a DRM prompt incorrectly. Click Cancel. If any data were received, you
will see the number of bytes in the bank list.
6. Once the bytes received count stops increasing, you can click Done to tell Cakewalk to stop receiving. However, if your
synthesizer also displays a message when the instrument is finished sending a bank, wait until that message says the
transmission is finished before you click Done.
The currently selected bank now holds the received Sysx data. At this point, you may want to give the bank a descriptive name by
selecting it and clicking Edit > Name.
See also:
“Editing Sysx banks” on page 1330
“Sysx view menu” on page 1330

Note: The Cakewalk librarian may not support synthesizers that require handshaking dump protocols. Some of these
synthesizers have a backup protocol where they will do a normal dump if they don’t get a handshake. Others do not.

More about Dump Request Macros
DRMs are defined in your Cakewalk.ini file in the [Dump Request Macros] section. You may add your own DRMs or modify
the ones that we have provided. Use the Windows Notepad to edit the file. Comments in the Cakewalk.ini file itself describe how
to write DRMs. The specific Sysx messages can be found in the instrument manual, or they can be obtained by contacting the
manufacturer. Remember that a DRM must start with F0 and end with F7.
Sometimes you will find that the byte size is different when you use a DRM, as opposed to initiating the dump from the instrument. It
is possible the instrument is dumping some additional information when you initiate the dump from the instrument, but you should be
able to use either method without any problems.
When you use the Sysx view File > Receive command, you may pick from a list of Dump Request Macros. These are short System
Exclusive messages sent to a synthesizer to make it dump (send back) System Exclusive data.
Please note that many of the DRMs included with Cakewalk have been donated by customers who are using the particular
equipment. In some cases, we have not been able to test those DRMs because we do not have access to that equipment. We
redistribute such DRMs on an as-is basis. Additional user-supplied DRMs may be available on the Cakewalk website
(www.cakewalk.com).

Editing Sysx banks
Editing a Sysx bank is very similar to creating one.

To edit a Sysx bank
1. In the Sysx view, select the bank you want to edit, and click Edit > Edit Data (or double-click the selected bank).
The Edit System Exclusive Bytes dialog box appears.
2. Edit your message(s). Each message in the window must begin with F0 and end with F7 (that’s F zero and F seven). See your
instrument’s manual for the messages you can create.
3. When you finish editing the message(s), click OK to close the window.
Save your project when you’re finished.

“Importing, creating, and dumping Sysx banks” on page 1328
“Sysx view menu” on page 1330

Sysx view menu
The Sysx view menu contains the following commands.

File menu
 Open. Load a .syx file into the selected Sysx bank.
 Send. Transmit the current bank’s System Exclusive message. If nothing seems to happen, make sure you have correctly set
the output. This command is disabled if the current bank is empty.

 Send All. Transmit all non-empty Sysx banks.
 Receive. Dump data from a synthesizer into the selected Sysx bank. If the bank contains data, Cakewalk asks you whether you
want the new data to overwrite the existing data or be appended to it.
When receiving dumps, remember to connect both the MIDI In and Out ports of the synthesizer to the MIDI interface. Also, make
sure that your instruments are set up to receive and/or transmit Sysx. Synthesizers that you normally use only to play sounds—
for example, sound modules that don’t have keyboards—don’t need to be hooked up in both directions except for receiving
dumps, so it is easy to forget this. (If you will only be sending Sysx messages to the device, the normal one-direction hookup is
sufficient.).

 Save. Save the selected Sysx bank as a .syx file. This is a good way to copy a Sysx bank between two Cakewalk project files.
Save the bank into a file, load the other Cakewalk project file, then load the bank again. This is also a good way to copy one bank
to another in the same project file.

 Clear. Delete the selected Sysx bank.
Edit menu
 Edit Data. Although Cakewalk’s Sysx features are designed mainly to store System Exclusive data for you, you can edit the
bytes of shorter messages in hex format (many of the more popular synthesizers have special patch-editing programs available
that let you edit data using sliders and other tools rather than raw hex data).
When you select a bank and choose the Edit Data command, Cakewalk converts the binary data into a text representation and
pops up the Edit System Exclusive Bytes dialog box, in which you can edit the text. If you make changes and click OK to keep
them, Cakewalk tries to convert the text back into binary format. You’ll get an error message if the text does not begin with an F0
and end with an F7, which are the System Exclusive begin and end bytes.
Cakewalk may not be able to convert the data to text format. The text representation requires three to four times more memory
than the data itself, and the Edit System Exclusive Bytes dialog box can contain roughly as much text as Notepad.

 Name. Enter a descriptive name for the selected Sysx bank. Names are saved only in .cwp and .cwb files.

1330

System exclusive data
Editing Sysx banks

Settings menu
 Auto Send on/off. Automatically transmit the selected bank every time Cakewalk loads the project file. You might use this
option for banks that contain System Exclusive messages that load a set of sounds for a synthesizer at or before the start of a
project.
Before transmitting, Cakewalk asks your permission. This is a safety feature for loading a file you have received from someone
else; if it happens to contain data for your synthesizer(s), you might lose your patches and configuration information. However, if
you don’t want to be asked, go to Edit > Preferences > File - Advanced and clear the Ask Before Sending System Exclusive
(When Opening Projects) check box.

 Output. Specify the MIDI output port to transmit the selected Sysx bank on.
To export a Sysx bank to another project
1. In the Sysx view, select the bank you want to export.
2. Click the Sysx view File menu and choose Save to open the Save As dialog box.
3. Navigate to the folder in which you want to store the file.
4. Enter a file name and click OK.
Cakewalk saves the file in the location you specified, with the extension .syx.
5. Open the project to which you want to import the bank and select an empty bank in the Sysx view (unless you want to add the file
to an existing bank).
6. Click the Sysx view File menu and choose Open to open the Open dialog box.
7. Navigate to the desired folder, select the .syx file you want to import, and click Open.
Cakewalk loads the selected bank into the current project.

Transmitting banks during playback
Cakewalk has a special meta-event, Sysx Bank, that lets you play a System Exclusive bank at a specified time in your project. You
can use a Sysx meta-event to send any of the 8192 available Sysx banks at any time in a sequence. To do this, you have to insert a
new event in the Event List using the INSERT key on the computer keyboard. Next you have to double-click Event Kind and change
it to System Exclusive. In the Values column, select the bank (0-8191) that you want to send.
MIDI is a serial data transmission, meaning it can do only one thing at a time. If you try to upload a huge sampler dump during a fast
drum solo, playback will noticeably lurch. MIDI must complete the System Exclusive message before it can resume playback. The
Sysx meta-event is appropriate only for very short System Exclusive messages. The exact length depends on various factors, such
as the speed of your computer but as a rule of thumb, 100 bytes is a likely maximum, and even that may often be too large.
You don’t need to use Sysx meta-events for sending System Exclusive information at the beginning of your project. Instead, use the
Auto option for System Exclusive banks. Banks that are marked Auto are transmitted automatically by Cakewalk when it loads the
project file they are stored in. Use the Sysx meta-event only when you need to send a Sysx Bank during the middle of the project.

Real-time recording of System Exclusive messages
You can record short System Exclusive messages in real time. These will end up in the track as the new Sysx Data types of events,
which can hold System Exclusive messages up to 255 bytes long. Before you record any Sysx messages, go to Edit >
Preferences > MIDI - Playback and Recording and make sure the System Exclusive check box is selected.

To record Sysx messages in real-time
1. Arm a MIDI track for recording—use a track that’s uses the output you want to send the Sysx data out through.
2. Press the Record button or press R to start recording.
3. Move the button or fader on your MIDI instrument that sends Sysx data.
4. Stop recording.
Cakewalk records your instrument’s Sysx data as a Sysx Data event. Open up the Event List view for the track you recorded on to
view the data. When you play back the MIDI track that the Sysx Data event is on, make sure that the Output field of the track is set
to the output that the MIDI instrument you want to send Sysx data to is on.

Sysx .ini file settings
The TTSseq.ini initialization file (%appdata%\Cakewalk\Cakewalk Core) contains settings that govern the sending and
receiving of System Exclusive information. If you are experiencing difficulties using Sysx, you will probably be able to correct the
problem by adjusting these settings.
The options described below occur in the [Options] section of the TTSseq.ini file. You can edit this file using the Windows
Notepad. Every time you add or change one or more lines in TTSseq.ini, you must restart Cakewalk in order for the change to
take effect.

SysxSendDelayMsecs=n
This setting causes Cakewalk to delay n milliseconds if it encounters an F7 in a System Exclusive bank, but only if the line
SysxDelayAfterF7=n is not zero. The line SysxDelayAfterF7=n enables a delay between Sysx messages, while the line
SysxSendDelayMsecs=n sets the size of the delay.
n = 60 Default value (in milliseconds)

SysxDelayAfterF7=n
This setting causes Cakewalk to delay Sysx transmission for a certain amount of time if it encounters an F7 in a System Exclusive
bank. This gives some instruments the required amount of “breathing” time necessary to process the Sysx transmission. The default
delay is 1/18 of a second, but can be changed by also adding the SysxSendDelayMsecs=n line, where n is the number of
milliseconds that the delay lasts.
The possible values of n in the line SysxDelayAfterF7=n are 0 and 1. Their significance is as follows:
n = 0 No delay
n = 1 Delay between each Sysx message

SysxSendPacketSize=n
System Exclusive bytes are transmitted in packets, with a 1/18-second default delay between each packet. Setting this value to a
smaller number will help slower synthesizers avoid overflowing their internal buffers. This line sets the number of bytes between
each Sysx transmit delay.
n = 1024 Default value (in bytes)
See:
“Troubleshooting” on page 1333
“What is System Exclusive?” on page 1326

Troubleshooting
Cakewalk is not receiving Sysx messages
 Make sure all your devices are connected correctly.
 Make sure you have the right MIDI Input selected in Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices.
 Make sure that your instrument is set up to transmit System Exclusive data.
Sysx bank names don't show when I open a file
Sysx bank names are only saved in .cwp and .cwb files (not in .mid files).

Cakewalk doesn't include a DRM for my instrument
If there is no Dump Request Macro (DRM) for your instrument, you should select You start dump on instrument, then initiate the
Sysx dump from the instrument. Once the bytes received count stops increasing, click Done to tell Cakewalk to stop receiving. The
currently selected bank now holds the received Sysx data. You can rename the bank if you want by selecting the bank and clicking
Edit > Name.
You can also add a DRM for any unlisted instrument. For more information about how to do this, read the section “More about Dump
Request Macros” on page 1329 earlier in this chapter.

Synthesizers reporting MIDI data errors
Some synthesizers will report data errors when you try to send Sysx information to them. This usually happens when Cakewalk
sends data at a rate too fast for the synthesizer to keep up. You can use the SysxSendPacketSize=number setting in
TTSseq.ini (%appdata%\Cakewalk\Cakewalk Core) to make Cakewalk transmit Sysx data more slowly, as described in
“Sysx .ini file settings” on page 1333.
Try setting the number to 64. If that does not solve the problem, try successively smaller values. If 64 works, you may try larger
values until it stops working; go back to the largest value that worked and you will have the fastest transmission rate that the
problematic synthesizer can keep up with.

My equipment is not receiving Sysx from Cakewalk
Make sure the instrument is set up to receive System Exclusive messages. In the Sysx View, make sure the right output is selected.
Verify that the Sysx message originally transmitted from the same kind of instrument. An instrument will not recognize Sysx
messages from a different make or model of instrument.
Finally, try adjusting the parameters in the TTSseq.ini file, as described “Sysx .ini file settings” on page 1333.

Timing requirements when receiving Sysx
Some MIDI devices have special timing requirements when receiving System Exclusive transmissions. If your equipment has
problems receiving System Exclusive data from Cakewalk, you might need to introduce some small delays to allow the equipment to
digest the information it is receiving.
The line in TTSseq.ini that reads SysxDelayAfterF7=n enables Cakewalk to introduce a delay between each Sysx message
so that the instrument has some time to respond to the message. Setting n to be 1 enables the delay. The line
SysxSendDelayMsecs=n lets you control how many milliseconds the delay is, where n is the number of milliseconds that the delay
lasts.

Roland equipment
Some Roland equipment—notably, the GR-1 and GR-50 Guitar Synthesizers—have problems receiving Sysx packets in fast
succession. You must use the setting SysxDelayAfterF7 = 1 with these devices.

Ensoniq instruments
Successfully sending Sysx messages to most Ensoniq instruments requires that you add the following three lines to the [Options]
section of TTSseq.ini:
SysxDelayAfterF7=1 Enables delay
SysxSendDelayMsecs=200 Sets delay time to 200 milliseconds
SysxSendPacketSize=65535 Increases packet size to 64k

Synchronizing your gear

Your computer is often used with other equipment: sound cards, MIDI equipment, and digital tape decks or other digital recording
tools. All these devices can have their own built-in clocks or timing mechanisms.
When several pieces of equipment are used together, it’s important that they operate in synchronization. For this to happen, all the
equipment must rely on the same source of clock or timing information. Cakewalk lets you use many different types of
synchronization so that you can get your work done quickly and efficiently.
See:
“Synchronization overview” on page 1336
“Choosing clock sources: Cakewalk as master” on page 1338
“MIDI synchronization” on page 1339

“MIDI Machine Control (MMC)” on page 1346

Synchronizing your gear

1335

Synchronization overview
Cakewalk supports several different types of synchronization, which rely on a variety of different clock sources:

Clock source

Timing is determined by

Internal

The clock on the computer motherboard

Audio

The clock on the computer’s sound card

MIDI Sync

The clock on an external MIDI device

SMPTE/MIDI Time Code (MTC)

A time code signal (in SMPTE or some other format) recorded on some external medium or
generated and sent by Cakewalk

When you use either the internal or audio clock, Cakewalk can control other MIDI devices using MIDI Sync. In this case, Cakewalk is
the “master” device and the other MIDI devices are the “slaves.”
When MIDI Sync is the clock source, Cakewalk operates either in response to incoming MIDI messages or as the sender. In this
case, Cakewalk can be either the master or the slave. Note that audio playback is not supported when using MIDI Sync with
Cakewalk as the slave.
When SMPTE/MIDI Time Code (SMPTE/MTC) is the source of timing information, Cakewalk operates in response to incoming MTC
messages. These messages could be generated by:

 An external MIDI device that is capable of generating MIDI Time Code (like the Roland VS880)
 A MIDI interface that is converting other time code signals (like SMPTE, EBU, or film time code) into MIDI Time Code
When you use some of these synchronization options, some Cakewalk commands work differently. This section describes each of
the synchronization options, how and why each is useful, and the effect each option has on other features and commands.
The Sync module in the Control Bar lets you change back and forth quickly between the different clock settings.

Synchronization overview

The Sync module contains the following controls:

 SMPTE/MTC format. Select the time code format. The following frame rates are supported:
 23.976 frames per second (FPS). Typically used with H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video.
 24 frames per second (FPS). Used for theatrical film worldwide. Any film in North America or Japan uses this setting.
 25 FPS. Used for PAL/SECAM video and some film in countries that use 50 Hz wall electricity. This is the setting to use
when synchronizing to any European video format.

 29.97 FPS Drop. NTSC broadcast and long format video in North America and Japan. This setting synchronizes the video
perfectly with Cakewalk, but the sequencer position displayed in the Now Time and Big Time displays will gradually drift and
become incorrect over long periods of time. The audio and MIDI synchronization to the external device will not be affected by
this discrepancy.

 29.97 FPS Non Drop. NTSC non-broadcast and short length video in North America and Japan. Used for some music
projects. This setting synchronizes the video perfectly with Cakewalk, but the sequencer position displayed in the Now Time
and Big Time displays will gradually drift and become incorrect over long periods of time. The audio and MIDI synchronization
to the external device will not be affected by this discrepancy.

 30 FPS Drop. Not a standard type of timecode, used rarely for speed correction and transfer problems in tape based
systems.

 30 FPS Non Drop. Most music projects and some film in North America. This is the best choice for any music project and
should be used unless the situation dictates otherwise.

 Incoming timecode. Shows the current time of incoming time code when synchronizing to an external device.
 Sync type. Select the sync type; right-click to show synchronization settings. The following sync types are supported:
 Internal Sync. Timing is determined by the clock on the computer motherboard.
 MIDI Sync. Timing is determined by the clock on an external MIDI device.
 SMPTE/MTC Sync. Timing is determined by a time code signal (in SMPTE or some other format) recorded on some external
medium or generated and sent by Cakewalk.

 Audio Sync. Timing is determined by the clock on the computer’s audio interface.
 Transmit MIDI Sync

. Transmit MIDI Sync to external MIDI devices, such as drum machines, stand-alone MIDI hardware
sequencers, and sequencers built into MIDI keyboards (only available when using the Internal or Audio clock). Cakewalk sends
messages to all other devices to start and stop playback and to keep all the devices in sync. Cakewalk can send MIDI Sync on
multiple MIDI output ports. For details, see “MIDI synchronization” on page 1339.

 Transmit MTC Sync

. Transmit MIDI Time Code (MTC) to external devices that can receive MTC. SMPTE/MTC is a
position and timing reference that indicates the current location in the project and how quickly the project should be playing.
SMPTE/MTC time code labels the position in a project in hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. The speed of playback is
indicated by a frame rate. Cakewalk can send MTC on multiple output ports simultaneously. For details, see “SMPTE/MIDI time
code synchronization” on page 1342.

You can also choose the sync mode as follows:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Clock.
2. Under Source, select the desired clock source.
3. Click OK.
The clock source and the type of synchronization that is used are options that are stored as part of your project files. For example,
one of your projects might be set up to use the internal clock; a second might use the Audio clock and MIDI Sync with Cakewalk as
the master timing source; and another might use SMPTE/MTC Sync as the clock source.
Many technical support requests concern synchronization problems, which are among the hardest to diagnose. If you experience
problems, before you contact support, perform as much experimentation and gather as much information as possible about what
does and doesn’t work. The more prepared you are, the more we can help.

Synchronizing your gear
Synchronization overview

1337

Choosing clock sources: Cakewalk as master
When Cakewalk is used alone, or with an external device that does not have its own clock or timing signal, you use one of two clock
sources: Internal or Audio.
When the clock source is set to Internal, Cakewalk uses the clock built into the computer or the computer’s MIDI interface as its
timing source. If your projects contain only MIDI (no audio), this is the most efficient method of playback.
If your projects contain MIDI and audio, or only audio, you should set the clock source to Audio. This lets the sound card clock
determine the correct speed for audio playback and automatically synchronizes MIDI playback to match the audio. For more
information, see “System configuration” on page 1356.
When either of these clock sources is used, you can also configure Cakewalk to drive other MIDI devices using MIDI
Synchronization. For more information, see “MIDI synchronization” on page 1339. If you need to send MIDI Time Code (MTC),
Cakewalk will send this data regardless of the clock setting.

To use the Internal clock source
Do one of the following:

 Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Clock and select Internal.
 In the Control Bar’s Sync module, click the Sync Type button and choose Internal Sync on the pop-up menu.

Choosing clock sources: Cakewalk as master

MIDI synchronization
MIDI Synchronization, or MIDI Sync, is usually used to synchronize Cakewalk with drum machines, stand-alone MIDI hardware
sequencers, and sequencers built into MIDI keyboards. Cakewalk can slave to MIDI Sync, and can send MIDI Sync on multiple
output ports.
When MIDI devices are synched, the master device sends messages to all other devices to start and stop playback and to keep all
the devices in sync. To change the tempo of a project, you adjust the tempo on the master device. The playback tempo on all slave
devices is then set automatically.
The following MIDI messages are sent by the master device to support MIDI Sync:
Message

How it is used

Start

This message tells slave devices to start playing from the beginning of the currently loaded sequence.

Stop

This message tells slave devices to stop playback.

Continue

This message tells slave devices to continue playing from the current location in the currently loaded
sequence.

Song Position Pointer (SPP)

This message tells slave devices to change the current location to the designated point in the project.
Cakewalk normally issues an SPP message immediately prior to any Start or Continue message.

Clock

The master sends clock messages to each slave device at the rate of 24 per quarter note. The slave devices
use these messages to establish the tempo and stay in sync.

When you start playback on the master MIDI device, for example, it sends a Start message to all slave devices, announcing that
playback has started. If the slave devices are set up correctly, they receive the message and start playing back with the master
device. When Cakewalk is set up as the master device, you can enable or disable these messages.
See:
“Cakewalk as the slave” on page 1340

Cakewalk as the slave
When Cakewalk is slaved to an external MIDI device, the following changes occur:

 When you click the Play or Record button, a message (Waiting for MIDI Sync) is displayed in the status bar. When you start your
external device, Cakewalk will follow.

 If you change the tempo using an external device, the SMPTE time code display in Cakewalk will be incorrect.
 Cakewalk will not transmit MIDI Start, Continue, Stop, and Clock messages.
 Digital audio will play back, but not necessarily in sync.
To use MIDI Sync with Cakewalk as the slave
1. Configure the external MIDI device you want to use as the master device to transmit MIDI Sync.
2. Configure external slave devices to receive MIDI Sync.
3. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI Devices and make sure the MIDI input port that connects to the MIDI Sync master is selected.
4. In the Preferences dialog box, go to Project - Clock and set Source to MIDI Sync.
5. In the Preferences dialog box, go to Project - MIDI and make sure Transmit MIDI Start/Continue/Stop/Clock is not selected,
and clear any selected ports under MIDI Sync Output Ports. Cakewalk will receive sync data from the sync master, and should
therefore not transmit any sync data.
6. In the Preferences dialog box, go to Audio - Sync and Caching and select Always switch clock source and start and
Maintain current clock source and wait for timecode. This will prevent Cakewalk from switching back to its internal clock.
7. Click OK.
From now on, Cakewalk starts playback and recording only after the appropriate message is received from the master device.

1340

Synchronizing your gear
MIDI synchronization

Cakewalk as the master
There are several options, found in Edit > Preferences > Project - MIDI, which you can use when Cakewalk is the MIDI Sync
master device:

Option

What it’s for

Transmit MIDI Start/Continue/Stop/Clock Choosing this option causes Cakewalk to tell the slave when to start, when to continue, when to stop,
and what timing data to go by (Cakewalk’s).
Use Start, Never Continue (grayed out
unless above option is checked)

If you are using an external drum machine to repeat a drum pattern or loop, you might always want
playback on the drum machine to start at the beginning of the loop. When this option is chosen,
Cakewalk sends a Start message to all slave devices when playback is started, even if you are in the
middle of a project. (Normally, Cakewalk would send a Continue message if playback starts from the
middle of a project.)

Transmit MIDI Song Position Pointer
(SPP)

When this options is checked, Cakewalk sends an SPP message before starting or continuing playback.
If you are using a drum machine as described previously, you might want to disable this option.

Locate Delay for SPP Recipient

Some older MIDI devices take a small amount of time to respond to SPP messages. This option causes
Cakewalk to delay briefly after sending an SPP message, to give the slave device time to respond. The
delay is in 1/18ths of a second. Enter 1 for a 1/18th second delay, 2 for 2/18ths of a second, or 18 for a
full second delay.

MIDI Sync Output Ports

Choose the outputs that your slave devices are connected to.

To use MIDI Sync with Cakewalk as the master
1. Configure your external MIDI devices to receive MIDI Sync.
2. Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - MIDI.
3. Select the Transmit MIDI Start/Continue/Stop/Clock check box.
4. For most applications, select the Transmit MIDI Song Position Pointer check box.
5. If you are using a drum machine to play patterns or loops, select the Use Start, Never Continue check box and clear the
Transmit MIDI Song Position Pointer check box.
6. In the MIDI Sync Output Ports field, check off the output ports that you want to send the sync signal out of.
7. Click OK.
From now on, the transport controls in Cakewalk control playback on the external MIDI devices.

Using MIDI Sync with drum machines
The most flexible way to use a MIDI drum machine is to record the notes it generates into Cakewalk, then use that machine as a
MIDI playback device. This lets you edit, cut, paste, and copy your drum parts like any other clip. You can use MIDI Sync to record
the notes from the drum machine into Cakewalk as follows:
1. Use the drum machine’s pattern-composing facilities to compose your drum part.
2. Configure the drum machine to be a slave device that receives MIDI Sync messages.
3. Configure Cakewalk to send MIDI Stop/Start/Continue/SPP messages.
4. Record the drum part from Cakewalk. The drum machine starts automatically when recording begins and stops automatically
when you press Stop.
5. Switch the drum machine out of MIDI Sync mode so that it acts simply as a sound-producing module.

Troubleshooting MIDI Sync
If you experience problems with MIDI Sync when Cakewalk is the master device, verify that your external devices are configured
correctly to respond to MIDI Sync. Most devices have a Clock option that should be set to External or MIDI.
If Cakewalk does not respond to MIDI Sync as a slave device, verify that your external devices are configured correctly to transmit
MIDI Sync. Remember that only one external device can be used as the master clock source.

Synchronizing your gear
MIDI synchronization

1341

SMPTE/MIDI time code synchronization
SMPTE/MIDI Time Code Sync (SMPTE/MTC) is another method of synchronization that lets Cakewalk act as a master or slave to
external devices. Cakewalk can send or receive SMPTE/MTC messages to or from external devices that can generate or receive
MTC. Cakewalk can send MTC on multiple output ports simultaneously.
SMPTE/MTC is a position and timing reference that indicates the current location in the project and how quickly the project should
be playing. Time code labels the position in a project in hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. The speed of playback is indicated by
a frame rate.
Time code is recorded onto tape using a device called a time code generator. The process of recording a time code signal onto a
track is called striping. Normally, the start of a tape stripe has a particular time, expressed in hours, minutes, seconds, and frames.
For example, the tape stripe might start at 00:00:00:00, 01:00:00:00, or any other time. The material recorded on the tape usually
starts anywhere from 10 seconds to several minutes after the start of the time code. Sometimes, the tape stripe starts at a time like
00:59:50:00, and the material starts 10 seconds later, at 01:00:00:00.
When you create a new Cakewalk project, by default the project is configured so that the beginning of bar 1 is synchronized with a
time code of 00:00:00:00. If the starting point of the material on your tape or external project is not 0, you need to enter an offset to
tell Cakewalk the time code that corresponds to the start of the project.

To enter an offset
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Clock.
2. Specify the desired offset in the SMPTE/MTC Offset field. To enter an offset of 15 seconds, type 0,0,15 and hit ENTER. The
SMPTE/MTC Offset value should now be 00:00:15:00 or 15 seconds.

Frame rates
Seven time code frame rates are supported in Cakewalk, which are normally used for the following types of applications:

SMPTE/MIDI time code synchronization

To use Cakewalk as the master MTC generator
1. Configure the clocks on each external device that you want to synchronize to receive SMPTE/MTC. Make sure they’re
connected to MIDI outputs from your computer or MIDI interface.
2. In the Control Bar’s Sync module, click the Sync Type button and choose Internal Sync or Audio Sync on the pop-up menu.
3. Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - MIDI.
4. Select the Transmit MTC check box (you can also click the Transmit MTC Sync button

in the Sync module).

5. In the Frame Rate field (it’s just below the Transmit MTC check box), choose the frame rate that your project uses (see “Frame
rates” on page 1342, if necessary).
6. In the MTC Output Ports field, check off the outputs that you want to send MTC on (the outputs your external devices are
connected to).
7. Click OK.
Cakewalk saves your sync and MTC output port settings with your project. However, output ports are saved by their number only, not
their name. Their number is determined by the order in which they appear in Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices. If you change
the order of devices in this dialog box, the MTC output ports in your project will retain the same numbers, but those numbers will now
refer to different outputs. Also, if you reduce the number of highlighted outputs in Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices, and the
MTC ports you chose have higher numbers than what are currently highlighted in Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices, Cakewalk
does not substitute new port numbers.

To configure Cakewalk to sync to SMPTE/MTC
1. In the Control Bar’s Sync module, click the Sync Type button and choose SMPTE Sync on the pop-up menu.
2. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Sync and Caching.
3. Select one of the following options:

 Ask first, then switch to clock source and start. This option prompts Cakewalk to alert you when it detects a SMPTE/
MTC signal, asks if you want to sync to the incoming signal, and if you respond that you do, switches the clock source and
starts to receive the signal.

 Always switch the clock source and start. Cakewalk automatically switches to the clock source of the incoming signal
and begins to receive the signal.

 Do not switch clock source, but start if in SMPTE/MTC mode. This option automatically syncs to the incoming signal if
Cakewalk is in SMPTE/MTC mode.
Note: The final option, Never switch clock source, never start, should never be used if you are attempting to sync to an external
clock source.
4. Click the Project - Clock page (Edit > Preferences > Project - Clock).
5. Choose the frame rate and time offset that are appropriate for your source material.
6. Click the MIDI - Devices page (Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices).
7. Make sure that your MIDI interface is highlighted in the Inputs list. If your interface also has a Sync driver, highlight that as well,
then click OK.

When Cakewalk is the slave, here’s how things work:

 Cakewalk monitors for a SMPTE/MTC signal. You are able to perform other action in Cakewalk while waiting for the signal.
 Start playback on the external device. It takes about two seconds for Cakewalk to lock from the time it receives time code input.
 If the time code is earlier than the start of the project (based on the time code offset), another message (Chasing…) is displayed
in the status bar. When the time code reaches the start of the project, Cakewalk starts to play in sync.

 If the time code is at or after the start of the project, Cakewalk starts playback as soon as it locks to the time code.
 When the external device stops (or when the time code ends), Cakewalk will stop.
Note: If you want Cakewalk to switch its clock source to SMPTE/MTC automatically when Cakewalk receives a SMPTE/MTC
signal, go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Sync and Caching and select the Always switch clock source to start option.

Playing digital audio under SMPTE/MTC sync
Cakewalk gives you two choices for controlling audio playback when using time SMPTE/MTC Sync:
Option

How it works

Trigger and freewheel

Audio event playback is started (or triggered) at the exact time code, but then the audio plays at its own internal
rate (or freewheels). When audio freewheels, it can gradually drift from the time code due to variations in the
time code signal.

Full chase lock

The speed of audio event playback is continually adjusted to stay in sync with the time code. If the external
clock drifts or changes rate, Cakewalk adjusts the audio playback speed to stay in sync. This adjustment may
introduce slight pitch changes, but those changes will be negligible if the external clock is reasonably steady.

Some digital sound cards (such as the Frontier Design Wavecenter or the Antex Studio Card) have external clock inputs. If you are
using one of these cards, and an external clock source like a digital tape deck is the master timing source for the project, choose the
Trigger and Freewheel option. The clock input on the audio card guarantees that there is no drift between the time code and audio
playback.

To set the audio playback option
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Sync and Caching.
2. Under Synchronization, select either Trigger & Freewheel or Full Chase Lock.
3. Click OK.
Audio playback under time code sync is handled according to the setting you chose.

SMPTE/MIDI time code synchronization

SMPTE/MTC sync and full chase lock
When using SMPTE/MTC Sync with full chase lock, the first time you play any audio the pitch may fluctuate wildly for up to 30
seconds. Also, you may occasionally note the pitch of the audio sounding consistently high or low pitch.
A simple analogy makes this behavior easy to understand: Synchronizing audio to SMPTE/MTC is a lot like trying to get even and
stay neck-and-neck with another car on the freeway. If the car is ahead of you, you need to drive faster to catch up to it. If it's behind
you, you have to slow until the car catches up to you. Once the two cars are neck-and-neck, you can simply keep going at the same
speed, unless the other car changes its speed. If the other car speeds or slows, you must speed or slow too.
The first time you play audio under SMPTE/MTC Sync, the audio clock has to get even with the external clock. This could mean
racing ahead, which raises the pitch of the audio, or stepping on the brakes, which lowers the pitch of the audio. These fluctuations
continue until Cakewalk matches its playback speed to the external clock, which usually takes no more than 30 seconds. The stable
playback speed, by the way, may be slightly faster or slower than the normal audio playback speed, resulting in a slight change in
the pitch of the audio. Here’s the best way to address this problem:

 Start each new Cakewalk session by playing some audio under SMPTE/MTC Sync.
 Let the audio play for 30 seconds or until all audio pitch fluctuations stop.
Once this procedure is complete, Cakewalk knows the difference in rates between the external time code and the audio clock on
your sound card. For the rest of the session, Cakewalk will start playback closely in sync, without any drastic pitch changes.
If the external timing source were 100 percent stable, the audio would stay in sync with the external clock. Unfortunately, no timing
source is perfect. Therefore, every once in a while after playback has started, Cakewalk may need to vary the playback speed by a
tiny amount to stay even with the time code. If the time code signal is unstable (as might be the case from an analog source), these
variations can cause noticeable changes in audio pitch, which can in turn cause audible audio distortion.

Troubleshooting SMPTE/MTC sync
The most common problems with SMPTE/MTC Sync, and ways to correct or avoid them, are shown in the following table.

Problem

What to do

The tape is striped incorrectly

Check the tape stripe using your time code generator and, if necessary, restripe the
tape.

The MIDI interface isn’t producing MIDI Time Code

Use utility programs that come with your MIDI interface to make sure that the time
code stripe is being received (sometimes you must enable a Time Code Sync option).
Check the MIDI interface settings to make sure that MIDI Time Code is being
generated.

The frame rate is set incorrectly

The frame rate on the stripe must match the frame rate you set in Cakewalk.

The offset is set incorrectly

The offset you enter in Cakewalk must match the start time of recorded material on the
tape.

Cakewalk is not configured correctly

Verify and/or repeat the steps in “To configure Cakewalk to sync to SMPTE/MTC” on
page 1343.

Audio playback drifts out of sync with the tape

Enable the Full Chase Lock option, which keeps audio from freewheeling.

Cakewalk continues playing for up to one full second after
the time code stops

Some time code readers tolerate dropouts of up to one second, without affecting
playback. When you stop the tape deck, it takes a full second for the reader to realize
that this isn’t merely a dropout and to signal the end of the time code to Cakewalk.
This does not indicate any problem with time code sync.

No MTC sync within 1 minute of midnight roll-over
Cakewalk will not sync to MTC within one minute of roll-over (1 minute before midnight; 23:59:00:00 - 23:59:59:xx). To address this,
use a SMPTE offset that doesn't require you to trigger the midnight roll-over.

MIDI Machine Control (MMC)
MIDI Machine Control (MMC) is a protocol that controls an MMC-equipped remote device via MIDI. Cakewalk lets you use MMC to
start and stop playback and recording on remote MIDI devices such as tape decks, video recorders, and even other software
packages. If you have several MMC-controllable devices in your studio, assign each a unique Unit ID so that MMC commands can
be addressed to a particular device.
MMC is very powerful when used with MIDI Time Code sync. For example, suppose you have an MMC-equipped digital tape deck
that generates time code and want to use the tape deck as the timing master for a project. You can set up your equipment and
software so that the transport controls in Cakewalk send MMC messages to the tape deck, which in turn starts and stops playback in
Cakewalk via SMPTE/MTC Sync. In this configuration, Cakewalk’s transport buttons (Play, Record, and Stop) are simply remote
control substitutes for the buttons on your tape deck. In this type of configuration, you must choose one MMC-controllable device as
the time code master.
When MMC is enabled, press Play to start playback on all connected MMC devices, and press Stop to stop all connected devices. If
you press Record while playback is underway, all connected MMC devices (e.g., tape decks) begin recording on any armed tracks.
If you stop recording (without stopping playback), Cakewalk instruct the tape decks to punch out. You must arm and disarm tracks on
the tape deck; you cannot do this from Cakewalk.
If you have established punch-in/out points in Edit > Preferences > Project - Record, Cakewalk will attempt to preprogram the
punch-in and punch-out times. However, your equipment must recognize the MMC event command for this feature to work. (Consult
the owner’s manual or contact the equipment manufacturer for more information.) If your equipment behaves erratically with
automated punch-in, don’t attempt to use it when those pieces of equipment are connected.
Cakewalk instructs MMC devices to locate the current project position only when playback or recording is started. This prevents
excessive wear on the motors and tape heads of the devices.

To configure MIDI Machine Control (MMC)
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - Clock.
2. Under Source, select SMPTE/MTC.
3. Click the Project - MIDI page (Edit > Preferences > Project - MIDI).
4. Select the Transmit MMC check box.
5. Enter the ID of the master timing device in the Time Code Master’s Unit ID box.
6. Click OK.
MMC is now enabled.

To disable MIDI Machine Control (MMC)
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Project - MIDI.
2. Make sure the Transmit MMC box is not checked, and click OK.
MMC is disabled.

Audio file management

Project files in Cakewalk do not contain the digital audio itself. A Cakewalk project file (.cwp) references the audio contained in the
project, so care must be taken when backing up your digital audio projects. This section covers file management, including backing
up your projects.
See:
“Project files and bundle Files” on page 1349
“Audio folders” on page 1350
“Backing up projects with digital audio” on page 1352
“Deleting unused audio files” on page 1353

Audio file management

1347

The Project Files dialog
Cakewalk projects, extension .cwp, contain all your project information with the exception of your digital audio data. This data is
stored in a separate folder or folders. You can opt to save the audio data for all of your projects in a single audio folder, or create
multiple folders.
The Project Files dialog box lists all of your project’s audio files and their location. This dialog box is a valuable tool for managing
your audio files. Access the dialog by opening a project and choosing Project > Audio Files.
Figure 565. The Project Files dialog box.

How to use the Project Files dialog
The Project Files dialog box has important information, including:

 Exactly which folders all of your audio files are saved in—know at a glance if you can backup your project by copying the audio
folder and the .cwp file or if you need to do a Save As to round up files not in your project’s audio folder.

 The filenames for each audio file your project is referencing
 The combined size the audio data in your project—important if you are going to backup your project
 The bit depth of every audio file in your project, including a display o the lowest and highest in the Min/Max Bit Depth field
 The location status of each audio file, which could be any of the following:
 Global. This means that the file is stored in the Global Audio Data directory. The Global Audio Data directory can be
changed in Edit > Preferences > File - Audio Data.

 Local. This means that the file is stored in the local wave data directory, a per-project data directory which is a subdirectory
in the directory where the project file is stored.

 External. This means that the file is stored in a directory other than the Global Audio Data directory or in a Local audio data
directory.

 Missing. This means that the file is not to be found.

Project files and bundle Files
Cakewalk project files contain various project settings, any MIDI data, and references which “point” to audio clip data. The audio data
(and video data) itself is not saved in a project file. To save audio as well, save your project as a Bundle file (extension .cwb). Bundle
files contain everything that a project file contains in addition to the digital audio. Bundle files are useful for backing up projects and
for burning onto removable media, like a blank CD or DVD.
The following are descriptions of both file types:
File Type

Description

When to Use

.cwp

Contains MIDI data, project settings, and pointers to audio
data in your Data directory. Project files contain no audio data,
so they are small. Backing up a Project file does not back up
the associated audio data.

Project files are good for routine projects. You can use
Project files and back them up as Bundle files at various
steps during a projects development.

.cwb

Contains all project data, including all audio data. Bundle files
are large.

Bundle files are useful for backing up projects or for
transporting a project to another computer (to bring it to a
friend's house, for example).

See “64-bit CWB files” on page 351.

To create a bundle file
1. Choose File > Save As to display the Save As dialog box.
2. Choose Bundle from the Save as Type list.
3. Enter a file name and click OK.
Cakewalk compacts all the audio and merges it with the remaining project data in a bundle file.

To unpack a bundle file
1. Choose File > Open to display the Open dialog box.
2. Choose a file with a .cwb extension.
3. Click Open.
4. If you want to store the project in its own folder do the following in the Unpack Bundle dialog:

 Enter a project filename in the Project Name field.
 Use the Browse button to the right of the Location field to select a destination folder for the project, or to create a new folder,
enter a new folder pathname in the Location field.

 Use the Browse button to the right of the Audio Path field to select a destination folder for the project’s audio data, or to
create a new folder, enter a new folder pathname in the Audio Path field.
5. Click OK.

1349

Audio folders
By default, Cakewalk stores audio data in an \Audio subfolder on a per-project basis. If you don’t immediately name a new project,
audio data will temporarily be stored in a special folder called the Global Audio Folder, the location of which is listed in the Global
Audio Folder field in Edit > Preferences > File - Audio Data.
Note: Previous versions of Cakewalk used a folder called the WaveData folder, located in the product directory.

See:
“Global audio folder” on page 1350
“Imported audio files” on page 1351

Global audio folder
You can change the location of the Global Audio Folder. This may be necessary if, for example, your hard disk is full and you want to
move all audio data storage to a different hard disk. We strongly recommend that you do not change the location of the Global Audio
Folder unless absolutely necessary.
If your original Global Audio Folder contains any audio files with the extension .wav, you must manually move these files to the new
Global Audio Folder using the Windows Explorer, or open the project and use the Missing Audio dialog box to find and move the
missing files.

To change the global audio folder
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - Audio Data.
2. Enter the pathname of the new Global Audio Folder in the Global Audio Folder field, or click the Browse button that’s at the
right end of the Global Audio Folder field to browse to the new directory.
3. Click OK when you are done.
4. Use the Windows Explorer or some other program to move all audio files from the old Global Audio Folder to the new Global
Audio Folder.
All new audio files will be stored in the new Global Audio Folder, unless you decide to use per-project audio.
Tip: It is safer, but more time-consuming, to first save the all projects as bundle files, change the Global Audio Folder, then open the
bundle files. This ensures that all of the audio data is properly moved to the new Data directory.

To create a new project using per-project audio
1. Select File > New.
The New Project File dialog box appears.
2. Enter a filename in the Name field
The Location and Audio Path directories are automatically updated in the following format:

 C:\default directory\<project name>. The default directory for new projects is assigned in Edit > Preferences >
File - Folder Locations. <project name> is the project’s per-project folder name.

 C:\default directory\<project name>\Audio. The default directory for new projects is assigned in Edit >
Preferences > File - Folder Locations. <project name> is the project’s per-project folder name, and Audio is the subfolder
where your audio data will be stored.
3. If you want, rename the Location and/or Audio Path directories.
4. Click OK.

1350

Audio file management
Audio folders

To save an existing project using per-project audio
You may have older files that are not using per-project audio folders. If you want to save these files using a per-project audio folder,
use the following procedure:
1. Open the project whose audio you want to store using per-project audio.
2. Select File > Save As.
The Save As dialog box appears.
3. If you want, change the name of your project.
4. In the Project Path field, enter the new directory where you want to save the project, or use the Browse button to the right of the
field to navigate to an existing directory.
5. Select the Copy all audio with project check box.
6. Click Save.
7. Cakewalk copies the project to the directory specified in the Project Path field and stores all the project’s audio in the directory
specified in the Audio Path field.
Note: After you use the above procedure, you have two versions of the same project.

Imported audio files
By default, Cakewalk will make a copy of any audio data imported using the File > Import > Audio command and place the
imported audio into the project’s audio folder. You can configure Cakewalk to simply reference audio from its current location if, for
example, you want to import large quantities of audio data into a project and don’t want to consume time and disk space by making
copies of the files. Copies are always made if the imported audio does not match the current project’s sampling rate (and if you edit
any of the imported audio data). Automatic handling of imported files is enabled by default. Do not disable this option unless you are
prepared to manage the audio files individually. Creating backups of your projects is very easy if all your audio is stored in a single,
per-project directory.

To change handling of imported files
Use the following procedure to allow or disallow file sharing between projects:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - Audio Data.
2. Select the Always Copy Imported Audio Files check box to create copies of all imported audio clips as a default.
Or
Clear the Always Copy Imported Audio Files check box to reference imported audio from its current location.
Note: You can override this setting when importing audio by checking or unchecking the Copy Audio to Project Folder option
in the Import Audio dialog box.
3. Click OK when you are done.
Imported files will be handled based on the settings you have chosen.

Backing up projects with digital audio
There are several ways to back up your projects in Cakewalk. You can use per-project audio folders to keep all a project’s audio in
its own folder, use the Consolidate Project Audio command to create a backup copy of all your project’s audio, or you can save a
project as a bundle file (.cwb).
The following table lists several backup methods.

Backup Method

Advantages

Per-project Audio Folders
If you are using per-project audio folders you can create a copy of the project folder and its audio
subfolder.

This method is an exact copy of your project,
preserving all clips and pathname information.

Consolidate Project Audio
If your project references audio from multiple folders, for example you have a library of loops that
you share between several projects, you can gather all the audio for your project into a single
folder using the Consolidate Project Audio command. The Consolidate Project Audio
command copies every audio file your project references into a backup folder beneath the
projects audio data folder. Creating a copy of all your project’s audio may take a lot of disk
space.

Allows you to create a complete backup of all
project audio even if the audio is in multiple
locations. Creates a new folder which you can
move or delete without fear of losing the original
audio files.

Bundle Files
A bundle file is a single file that contains all the information—except video—used in a project. A
bundle file includes everything that is stored in a normal project file, plus all the digital audio that
is used in the project.

Creates a single file for ease of portability.

To backup projects using per-project audio folders
Use this procedure to create a backup of a project that has its own project folder.
1. Open the project you want to backup.
2. Select Project > Audio Files.
The Project Files dialog box appears.
3. In the Project Files dialog box, check the Path column to make sure that every audio file is stored in the project’s audio folder. If
any files are stored in folders other than the project’s audio folder, you should use the Consolidate Project Audio command to
move all audio to the project’s audio folder.
4. Close the Project Files dialog box once you have confirmed that all audio files are in the project’s audio folder.
5. Close the project.
6. Using Windows Explorer, copy the project folder and its contents, including the project’s audio folder, to its backup location (CDR, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, another hard drive, network drive, etc.).
You have now created a copy of your project. It is a good idea to open the project once you have backed it up to confirm that all
audio loads properly.

To create a backup using the Consolidate Project Audio command
Use this procedure to backup a project that has multiple audio folders:
1. Open the project you want to backup.
2. Select Utilities > Consolidate Project Audio.
3. A message box appears listing the destination folder for your audio backup.
4. Click OK to confirm.
5. Using Windows Explorer, copy the project, the backup folder and all its contents, including the project’s audio folder, to its backup
location (CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, another hard drive, network drive, etc.).
Note: The Consolidate Project Audio command only copies the audio in your project, so make sure you copy the project (.cwp)
along with the backup folder.
6. Once you have copied the backup folder you can delete it to free up disk space.

Audio file management
Backing up projects with digital audio

Deleting unused audio files
The Clean Audio Folder utility lets you free up disk space by deleting obsolete audio files that are no longer used by a project.
You can choose to scan just the current project, or all projects on your computer. Cakewalk compiles a list of all the audio files in a
specified folder that are not in use by any of these projects, and lets you audition and delete these audio files.

To delete unused audio files in the current project
1. Open the project you want to scan.
2. Go to Utilities > Clean Audio Folder.
3. Make sure the Project/Audio Folder field is set to the root folder the project lives in.
4. Make sure Search entire PC is not selected.
5. Click Find. Cakewalk recursively searches the selected folder for audio files that are unused by the current project, and displays
the names of these files in the list.
6. Follow the instructions in the table:

To do this

Do this

Listen to a file

Highlight the file name in the list and click Play

Delete a file

Highlight the file name in the list and click Delete

Delete all files

Click Delete All, and click Yes to confirm

7. Click Close when you are done.

Note: Select Search entire PC if you have backup versions of the current project file saved in another location.

Tip: If you save multiple copies of a project in subfolders, set Project/Audio Folder to the root folder that contains the projects. This
ensures that all the projects will be scanned.

1353

To delete unused audio files in all projects
1. Make sure that all of your important project (.cwp) files are stored on your local hard disk(s). If your project files are stored
elsewhere (removable media, etc.), then you risk accidentally deleting important audio files that are associated with your
projects.
2. Close all projects.
3. Go to Utilities > Clean Audio Folder.
4. Make sure the Project/Audio Folder field is set to the global audio folder (default when no project is loaded). Search entire PC
is automatically enabled.
5. Click Find. Cakewalk searches the entire system for project files, and lists any audio files in the Project/Audio Folder that do
not belong to projects on your system. If any corrupted or unreadable project files exist on your system, the Unreadable Files
dialog box appears. It is very important that you restore any unreadable files from a backup before continuing, otherwise you risk
data loss.
6. Follow the instructions in the table:

To do this

Improving audio performance

Digital audio presents several challenges: it is large, using enormous amounts of disk space, especially at higher sampling rates and
bit-depths, and it is CPU-intensive. Added to this mix is the wide variety of audio hardware available today. This section covers some
common problems with recording and playback and how to configure your computer and audio hardware for optimum performance.
See:
“System configuration” on page 1356
“Plug-in load balancing” on page 1363
“Improving performance with digital audio” on page 1366
“Dropouts and other audio problems” on page 1373

Improving audio performance

1355

System configuration
This section covers optimizing your system configuration to work with Cakewalk.
See:
“The Wave Profiler” on page 1356
“Enabling and disabling audio devices” on page 1357
“Sampling rates” on page 1358
“Bit depths and float resolution” on page 1359

The Wave Profiler
The Wave Profiler is a utility that analyzes the sound cards in your computer and determines the best DMA (Direct Memory Access)
settings for communicating with Cakewalk. These DMA settings are displayed in samples, at the sample rates and bit depths your
sound card supports. The Wave Profiler also sets a value in milliseconds for the Buffer Slider, which controls mixing latency. The
Wave Profiler is unnecessary if you are using an ASIO driver.
The DMA settings are used to ensure that a project that contains both MIDI and digital audio plays back in tight synchronization. If
Cakewalk is not configured properly with your audio device’s DMA settings, MIDI and digital audio material may not play back
correctly.
Note to users of previous Cakewalk products: The DMA settings in versions of Cakewalk prior to Cakewalk 1.0 were displayed in
bytes rather than samples. Using your previous DMA settings in Cakewalk will not work. Try the settings that wave profiler displays,
and if you are not satisfied, only then attempt to optimize your settings.
The Wave Profiler utility runs automatically the first time you run Cakewalk. The wave profiler determines the best DMA settings for
the supported bit depths and sample rates of your sound card.
Note: It is possible to load a 48 kHz project when you are using a sound card that does not support 48 kHz. Cakewalk does not
warn you when you do this. Your project may crash, or it may appear to record audio when your project is not actually recording.
All of your audio settings are listed in the Preferences dialog box, which you open with the Edit > Preferences command. The
following list summarizes all the settings that the Wave Profiler sets. You can override all of them except what audio drivers are listed
in the Drivers tab:

 Input and output drivers
 DMA buffer sizes (in samples)
 Mixing latency
If you experience MIDI and audio synchronization problems during playback, before contacting technical support, run the Wave
Profiler and try the default settings.

To manually run the Wave Profiler
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings.
2. Click Wave Profiler.
The Wave Profiler examines each of your sound cards in turn, makes default settings in the Preferences dialog box, and displays
the name of each sound card and the sample rates that each card supports.
Note: The Wave Profiler is not available when using ASIO drivers.

1356

Improving audio performance
System configuration

Enabling and disabling audio devices
Your computer may have several installed devices like FAX modems and software synthesizers that Windows recognizes as sound
cards containing audio drivers. You do not want to use these devices for audio input or output. If they are listed as audio drivers in
the Preferences dialog box, you need to disable them.

To enable or disable an audio device
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Devices.
2. In the Input Drivers and Output Drivers fields, do one or both of the following:

 To enable an audio device, click the name of the device so that it is highlighted.
 To disable an audio device, click the name of the device so that it is not highlighted.
3. Click OK.
Disabling a device in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Devices usually prevents conflicts with other audio devices. Occasionally you
may need to disable a device in the Windows Control Panel.
Cakewalk also allows you to choose the sound card whose clock should be used to control recording and playback timing (if you
only have one sound card, Cakewalk automatically uses it). Every sound card’s clock crystal is slightly different, which causes minor
differences in the actual playback rate on each card. These differences may lead to slight synchronization problems if you use one
card for recording and a different one for playback. Generally, you should choose your highest quality sound card for both recording
and playback timing. Note that while some multichannel sound cards have multiple drivers, most sound cards have only a single
audio driver.

To select playback and record timing masters
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings.
2. In the Playback Timing Master and Record Timing Master fields, select which sound cards you want to control playback and
record timing, respectively.
3. Click OK.
While you must choose a playback timing master, you can route audio output through any number of devices at once. For example,
suppose your computer has both a high-end audio card and a basic built-in sound card. You should choose the high-end sound card
as the record and playback timing master. However, using the buses in the Console or Track views, you could create a headphone
or monitor mix and route it through the built-in sound card.

System configuration

1357

Sampling rates
Cakewalk supports all common sampling rates. Only one sampling rate is allowed per project. It’s usually better not to change the
sampling rate of a project, because this involves exporting your tracks one at a time, and then importing them at the new sampling
rate. During this process you lose clip boundaries, envelopes, and other separate data that is mixed into the exported tracks.

To set the sampling rate for new projects
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings and change the Sampling Rate field to the desired number. You can
choose from the available options, or enter any number that your hardware supports.
2. Click OK.

To change the sampling rate of a project
1. Select all audio tracks in the project, then go to File > Export Audio to open the Export Audio dialog box.
2. Under What To Export, set Source Category to Tracks.
3. Under Format, set Sample Rate to the new target sample rate.
4. Click Export to export all tracks as individual files.
5. After you have exported all the tracks you want to convert, go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings and change the
Sampling Rate field to the desired number.
6. Use the File > New command to open a new project and specify the desired sample rate.
7. Use the File > Import > Audio command to open the Import Audio dialog box.
8. Select the audio files you just exported (hold down the CTRL key while you click each one), and click Open to import the files.
Cakewalk imports the selected files at the new sampling rate.
9. Copy/Paste everything else from the old project to the new one.

To import audio that has a different sampling rate
 Use the File > Import > Audio command to import the audio file(s) (this converts them to the project sampling rate).

1358

Improving audio performance
System configuration

Bit depths and float resolution
Cakewalk supports all common bit depths, including 64. Cakewalk’s 32-bit mixing provides full floating-point resolution for extended
dynamic range, and precise audio processing. For maximum dynamic range and precision, you can also choose 64-bit mixing (go to
Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings and select the 64-bit Double Precision Engine check box). Cakewalk can import,
export, play back, and render 64-bit float files.
A Cakewalk project can contain files of different bit depths. You can specify different bit depths for playing back, recording, importing,
exporting, and rendering audio (bouncing, freezing, applying effects). To play back or record at a specific bit depth, your sound card
must support that bit depth.
Notes about 64-bit files:

 64-bit files can now be imported at their native 64-bit depth.
 At playback time 64-bit files are streamed at full 64-bit resolution when the Double Precision engine is turned on.
 At playback time 64-bit files are converted to 32-bit when the Double Precision engine is turned off.
 64-bit is a choice in the File Import dialog box.
 64-bit is a choice in the Edit > Preferences > File - Audio Data file bit depth fields.
 Bounce-to-track now renders at 64-bit if the render bit depth is set to 64.
 You can save and load .cwb files containing any combination of 16/24/32/64 and stereo/mono wave files.
To find the bit depth of clips in a project
Do one of the following:

 Right-click a clip, choose Associated Audio Files on the pop-up menu, and examine the Bit Depth column.
 Go to Project > Audio Files command to open the Project Files dialog box, and examine the Bit Depth column.
The following topics show you how and why to choose bit depths for various operations.

Bit depths for playback
Most sound cards can play audio at 16-bit or 24-bit resolution, with a few sound cards supporting 18-bit and 20-bit resolution. When
your project contains files with different bit depths Cakewalk plays them at the bit depth that your sound card is currently set to.
Because Cakewalk can play projects that contain files of different bit depths, you don’t have to convert 16-bit files to 24 bits to play
them with other 24-bit files, saving significant storage space. If you’re playing 64-bit, 32-bit, or 24-bit files at 16 bits, you can turn
dithering on in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording to compensate for the truncated data.
When you first install Cakewalk, the Wave Profiler profiles your sound card at all the bit depths that the sound card supports, so
when you change the playback bit depth, you don’t need to run the Wave Profiler again (you do need to relaunch Cakewalk).
Here’s how to change the playback bit depth for a project:

To change playback bit depth
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording and choose the bit depth you want to use in the Audio Driver Bit
Depth field.
2. Click OK.
Note:
• If you choose to play back at greater than 16 bits, you may need to pick a bit format for your data in Edit > Preferences >
Audio - Audio Profiles in the Stream > 16 Bit Data As field. You may need to consult your sound card’s documentation to
find the optimum setting.
• Some audio devices, especially USB devices that use WDM drivers, can not operate in 24-bit mode unless a variable in
Cakewalk’s Aud.ini file is set to 1. The variable is Use24BitExtensible=<0 or 1>, which goes in the [name of your
audio device (‘n’ in, ‘n’ out)] section of the Aud.ini file.
• Cakewalk 4 does not play back projects that contain files with different bit depths (Cakewalk 5 and later), so if you want to
open a multiple bit depth project in Cakewalk 4, see the following procedure or a conversion procedure.

To rewrite audio files at different bit depths
1. Use the Utilities > Change Audio Format command to open the Change Audio Format dialog box.
2. Choose a new bit depth in the New Bit Depth field.
3. If you’re changing to 16 bits, you can select or clear the Apply Dither check box. Dithering means to add a certain audio signal
to 16 bit audio to make it sound more like it did as a higher-bit signal.
4. Click OK.
Cakewalk rewrites the audio tracks in your project at the new bit depth.

Bit depths for recording
You can choose the bit depth of newly-recorded files in Cakewalk, and you can change this value at any time. The Transport module
in the Control Bar shows the project sampling rate and the current record bit depth setting.
The choices for the recording bit depth setting are 16, 24, 32, and 64. At present, no devices can record at 32-bit or 64-bit resolution,
so you don’t need to choose these options yet. 24-bit files give greater dynamic range than 16-bit files, so 24 is a good choice for
music that gets very soft, as well as loud. 16-bit recording is efficient for many recording projects, especially louder projects.

To choose a recording bit depth
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - Audio Data.
2. Under File Bit Depths, change the Record Bit Depth field to the desired number.
3. Click OK.

Bit depths for importing audio
You can choose the bit depth of imported files in Cakewalk, and you can also import files at their current bit depth. You can import
files at bit depths as high as 64. Because Cakewalk can play projects that contain files of different bit depths, you don’t have to
convert 16-bit files to 24 bits to play them with other 24-bit files, saving significant storage space.
Note: If you are playing back 32-bit or 64-bit audio at high sample rates (and high latency sizes), the disk I/O buffer size in
Edit > Preferences > Audio - Sync and Caching may need to be increased to handle this extra disk streaming throughput. A
too small disk I/O buffer size can result in dropouts or clicks during audio playback of such content. If so try a higher I/O buffer
size like 256 or 512.
See “Bit depths and float resolution” on page 1359 for more information about 64-bit files.

To choose an importing bit depth
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - Audio Data.
2. Under File Bit Depths, change the Import Bit Depth field to the desired number. You can choose the Original option to import
the files at their current bit depth.
3. Click OK.
This process changes the default import bit depth, which appears in the Import Audio dialog box. You can override this value for
one import process at a time by changing the value in the Import Audio dialog box.
See also “Cakewalk project file compatibility notes” on page 1362.

Bit depths for exporting audio
You can choose the bit depth of exported files from Cakewalk. Unless you are burning a CD or DVD, or are concerned about storage
space, you can export files at 32 bits (or even 64) to preserve the precision of any audio processing that was done to the files.

To choose an exporting bit depth
1. Use the File > Export > Audio command to open the Export Audio dialog box.
2. In the Bit Depth field, select the desired number.
3. Choose other options and click Export.

Bit depths for rendering audio
You can choose the bit depth that Cakewalk uses for such operations as bouncing tracks, freezing tracks, and applying effects
(these processes are referred to as rendering). This bit depth is set at 32 by default, which allows large level changes without
clipping, and with greater dynamic range, especially in soft parts of your music. You can also render at 64 bits for greatest precision.

To choose a rendering bit depth
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - Audio Data.
2. Under File Bit Depths, change the Render Bit Depth field to the desired number.
3. Click OK.

Preparing higher-quality audio for CD burning
If your project uses a different sampling rate from 44,100, or contains files that are not 16-bit, use this procedure to prepare your
project for CD-burning:

To prepare higher-quality audio for CD burning
1. Choose File > Export > Audio to open the Export Audio dialog box.
2. Under Format, click File Type and select Wave.
3. Click Channel Format and select Stereo.
4. Click Sample Rate and select 44100.
5. Click Bit Depth and select 16.
6. After exporting the audio, close Cakewalk and open up your sound card control panel (for M-Audio cards, usually the Delta
Control Panel, for Echo Audio, usually the Echo Console, for MOTU it's the 324 console, etc.) Once the control panel is open,
change the setting for your sampling rate to 44.1 kHz.
7. Next launch Cakewalk, go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings and change the Audio Driver Bit Depth to 16.
Change Default Settings for New Projects to 44100 Hz for the Sampling Rate.
8. After making these adjustments, click the Wave Profiler button. In some instances, with certain audio hardware configurations
you may be prompted with an audio driver error dialog box during this process. This is nothing to be concerned about. You will
have to exit Cakewalk, re-launch, verify the settings you made in the Preferences dialog box, and click the Wave Profiler button
again. When you can successfully run the Wave Profiler without an audio driver error, proceed to the next step.
9. Create a new project (File > New command). The Normal option is fine for this.
10. Import the mixed down audio by using the File > Import Audio command.
11. Confirm the bit depth and sample rate of the imported audio by using the File > Info command, and clicking File Stats. The File
Stats dialog box lists the correct sample rate and bit depth.
12. Final step: use the File > Export > Audio command. Be sure to select 16 for the Bit Depth and uncheck all Mix and Render
options.
Now you can burn your exported audio file to CD, using Pyro Audio Creator, or other software.

Plug-in load balancing
CPU
Core 1
Core 2
Core 3
Core 4
Core 5
Core 6
Core 7
Core 8

The purpose of plug-in load balancing is to prevent audio dropouts caused by high effect processing loads.
When using multi-core CPU processors, Cakewalk allows you to increase the number of plug-ins you can use in a project by
distributing the processing across multiple cores. The biggest benefit will be seen on systems with 4 or more physical cores.
A project’s biggest processing load is normally attributed to plug-in processing, which can lead to CPU spikes, inefficient load
balancing among the cores on a multi-core PC, and audio dropouts.
Cakewalk’s plug-In load balancing exploits the full power of multi-core CPUs to balance DSP workloads across multiple cores when
possible. This can lead to better CPU loading and fewer spikes in the audio engine.

Important: Load balancing uses multiple cores to process plug-in buffers in parallel. This requires plug-ins to be multiprocessing compliant. If any plug-ins are not multi-processing compliant, you may hear crackles during playback when load
balancing is enabled.

To enable/disable plug-in load balancing
To enable/disable plug-in load balancing, go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording and select Plug-In Load
Balancing. This option is only available if Use Multiprocessing Engine is enabled.
When enabled, Cakewalk will attempt to load balance FX Racks that contain two or more unbypassed plug-in effects, including track
FX Racks, bus FX Racks, clip FX Racks, FX Chains, ProChannel FX Racks, and ProChannel FX Chains.
Enabling Plug-In Load Balancing does not introduce any latency.

When to use plug-in load balancing
To determine if a project will benefit from plug-in load balancing, first check the Control Bar’s Performance module to see if any cores
are spiking. The Performance module lets you monitor the activity of each CPU core. For details, see “Performance module” on
page 670.
Plug-in load balancing disabled

Plug-in load balancing enabled

Note: The Control Bar’s Performance module can display several different CPU meter modes. To display a meter for each core,
right-click the Performance module, point to CPU Meter Display Options, then select Audio Processing Load.
Enable Plug-In Load Balancing if:

 The project experiences excessive core spiking or one core is significantly higher than others. If the CPU load is even to begin
with, there likely won’t be any benefit.

 The project uses a high audio latency setting.
 If one track is performing most of the effects processing.
Improving audio performance
Plug-in load balancing

1363

When not to use plug-in load balancing
Load balancing itself incurs some overhead since internally it subdivides and processes the plug-ins at smaller buffer sizes. If the
loads are not unbalanced to start with, this overhead can exceed the benefit.
There will likely not be any benefit from enabling Plug-In Load Balancing in the following cases:

 The CPU load is even to start with (there is no excessive spiking of cores or one core is not significantly higher than others).
 The project uses many lightweight plug-ins with similar load.
 All tracks use about the same number of effects or have similar load.
 The project uses a low Mixing Latency Buffer Size setting (<256 samples) in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings.
Plug-in load balancing does not apply to the following:

 Synths in the Synth Rack. These are not processed serially and do not benefit from this technology.
 FX Racks that have plug-ins with active side chains.
 External Inserts.
How plug-in load balancing works
It is important to understand the impact load balancing has on CPU load. Load balancing reduces processing time but potentially at
the cost of increased CPU use. When enabled, Cakewalk attempts to share processing load of all plug-ins in FX Racks by
distributing the load among the available cores.
Consider the following FX Rack chain with four plug-ins of different processing loads, and FX2 being the most expensive:
FX Rack

Workload:

FX1

FX2

FX3

FX4

1x

2x

1.2x

1.4x

In this example, FX2 becomes the bottleneck in the processing, since the downstream plug-ins have to wait for its processing to
finish. When Plug-in Load Balancing is enabled, Cakewalk optimizes this chain, by subdividing the workload and scheduling
processing the plug-ins in parallel to distribute the load across multiple cores when possible:
FX Rack

Improving audio performance
Plug-in load balancing

Plug-in load balancing buffer size
By default, if the Mixing Latency Buffer Size setting in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings is < 256 samples, it is too
low for load balancing because the buffers cannot be subdivided further. This is equivalent to Plug-in Load Balancing being
disabled for all FX Racks. This threshold can be tweaked by changing the MinPluginLoadBalancingBufferSamples variable
in Aud.ini, which controls the size of the smallest internal buffer subdivision that may be used for plug-in load balancing. The
minimum value is 32 samples and the max is 256. The default value is 128 samples. Lowering the value will make load balancing
more aggressive and consume more CPU for processing, but normally there should be no need to adjust this value.
The MinPluginLoadBalancingBufferSamples setting should not be confused with the Mixing Latency Buffer Size setting.
Load balancing subdivides the audio buffer into multiple smaller buffers depending on the number of plug-ins in the FX Rack. If the
Mixing Latency Buffer Size value is smaller than MinPluginLoadBalancingBufferSamples × 2 samples, then load balancing
has no effect.
To specify the size of the smallest internal buffer subdivision that may be used for plug-in load balancing:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Configuration File.
2. Under Configuration Settings, click Edit Config File.
The Aud.ini file opens in the default Windows text editor.
3. In Aud.ini, add a new entry called MinPluginLoadBalancingBufferSamples in the [Wave] section, and set its value to
the minimum desired buffer sample value. For example:
[Wave]
MinPluginLoadBalancingBufferSamples=192
4. Save Aud.ini and close the Windows text editor.
5. Click Reload Config Settings to reload the current audio configuration settings from Aud.ini.

Improving performance with digital audio
When a project contains many tracks of digital audio or when many real-time effects are in use, your computer may have difficulty
keeping up during playback. When this occurs, you'll hear portions of the audio drop out, stutter, or pop. Or maybe your project
responds slowly to real-time effects and volume changes. In an extreme case audio playback may stop altogether. If you experience
a dropout, a dialog box appears with suggestions for fixing the problem. This section covers performance issues specific to digital
audio, including how to get the more tracks of audio, more real-time effects, lower latency and how to fix audio dropouts.
For more information, see:
“Getting the most out of your computer” on page 1366
“Mixing latency” on page 1368
“Dropouts and other audio problems” on page 1373
“Reduce GUI updates to improve playback performance” on page 1371

Getting the most out of your computer
The maximum number of audio tracks you can expect to play on your computer depends on the audio sample rate, the speed of
your hard disk, and the speed of your computer’s CPU.
The effect of your CPU on audio track throughput is much more difficult to quantify. Throughput is affected by the type of chip, clock
speed, the number and type of real-time effects in use, cache size and settings, and many other factors.
There are a variety of things you can do to increase the number of audio tracks and effects you can play on your computer, as
outlined in the following table.
Approach

How it works

Avoid compressed disks

If you use DoubleSpace, Stacker, or some other disk compression system, it will slow down
playback of audio tremendously. Configure your system so that the Data directory is on a hard
disk that is not compressed.

Exit other programs

The more programs you have open, the more CPU cycles you are taking away from your
project. Exit any programs unnecessary to the task at hand.

Refrain from other activity during playback

If you open and close windows or do lots of editing while playback is in progress, you may steal
CPU cycles that would otherwise be used for playback.

Apply some audio effects offline

If you are happy with your real-time effects, consider using the Process > Apply Effect > Audio
Effects command to apply those effects offline. Then remove those effects from real-time use
and free up lots of CPU power.

Archive unused audio tracks

Audio tracks that are muted continue to place a load on your processor. To lessen the burden
and free up cycles to handle more audio, archive all unused audio tracks. See “To archive or
unarchive tracks” on page 298 for more information.

Mix down or freeze your audio/synth tracks

If your project contains many different audio/synth tracks or many real-time effects, you can use
the Track view Tracks > Bounce to Track(s) command or click a track’s Freeze Track button
to reduce all of this content to an audio track or tracks with no active effects.

Change I/O Buffer Size on the Advanced tab of
the Audio Options dialog box

The default setting is 64 KB. Yours may work better with 128, 32, or 16. If those values don’t
help, try 256, 512, or move on to another remedy.

Defragment your hard disk

If your hard disk is fragmented, playback of audio will be slower. Use the Disk Defragmenter to
correct the situation.

Turn off dithering in the Edit > Preferences >
Audio - Playback and Recording dialog box
(choose None in the Dithering field).

Dithering subtly improves your mix, but most people can’t hear it. Turn it back on for mastering.

1366

Improving audio performance
Improving performance with digital audio

Approach

How it works

Enable read and write caching

By default, Cakewalk bypasses all disk caching, which typically results in better performance
with audio data. If your computer has an older IDE disk controller, or a disk controller that does
not use DMA transfers, enabling caching may improve Cakewalk's audio performance.
Note: Changes to these settings only take effect when you restart Cakewalk. Go to Edit >
Preferences > Audio - Sync and Caching to change the Enable Read Caching and Enable
Write Caching settings.

Disable the Display Clip Contents options

Drawing the contents of audio clips in the Clips pane uses some CPU cycles. If you are using a
slow machine, you may want to disable this feature. To do so, click the Track view View menu,
point to Display and choose Display Clip Contents.

Digital audio files and storage
Digital audio requires a large amount of disk storage. The following table shows the disk space requirements in megabytes for a
single minute of digital audio in mono and stereo at various sampling rates.

Mixing latency
Cakewalk has a Buffer Size slider in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings to set mixing latency. Mixing latency is the
amount of time Cakewalk allocates to prepare a buffer full of audio data for playback. Lower latency settings add processing time
because of the need to refill the smaller data buffers more often. You may need to use the slider to increase mixing latency under
the following conditions:

 You use lots of real-time effects, and you hear dropouts. Check the CPU meter for high readings; try increasing the latency.
 Your sound card does not function well at lower latency. Some sound cards just do not function well at lower latency settings.
Even though Cakewalk’s CPU meter and Dropout indicator report no problems, if you hear dropouts try increasing the mixing
latency.
Sound cards differ in the precision of their timing, what size audio buffers they require, and other characteristics. Cakewalk has a
utility called the Wave Profiler that can usually automatically detect the type of sound card that you have installed and configure its
settings for best performance. If your sound card is a well-known model, you can usually use Cakewalk without having to change
many audio settings. However, if you experience synchronization problems between MIDI and digital audio, like to use different
sample rates and bit depths, or want to experiment with mixing latency, you need to do some optimization yourself.
See:
“The Wave Profiler” on page 1356
“CPU meter/Disk meter/Dropout indicator” on page 1370

ASIO drivers
Cakewalk supports ASIO drivers. You are limited to a single sound card when using an ASIO driver.

To use an ASIO driver
Use the following procedure to enable Cakewalk for use with an ASIO driver.
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording.
2. Click the Driver Mode list and select ASIO.
Cakewalk re-profiles your audio hardware.
Note: Some ASIO drivers are know to be incompatible with Cakewalk and can lead to instability or crashes. If an incompatible
ASIO driver is detected, Cakewalk will offer to switch the driver mode to WASAPI.

ASIO sample position
UseHardwareSamplePosition=<0, 1>, default = 0
This variable applies to ASIO mode only and controls whether Cakewalk internally compute the sample position based on buffer
switch calls or uses the ASIOGetSamplePosition reported value to retrieve the driver reported value.
Some drivers change the reported sample position based on how long a buffer switch took to complete and this can cause problems
since Cakewalk expects the reported position to be in sync with the number of buffers actually streamed.
This Aud.ini variable defaults to 0.

1368

Improving audio performance
Improving performance with digital audio

Minimize driver state changes
Cakewalk has an option to not reset audio devices each time playback or recording starts. This option minimizes device state
transitions in response to transport operations. When enabled, Cakewalk attempts to keep the device in a running state as far as
possible.

To configure the MinimizeDriverStateChanges option
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Configuration File.
2. Under Configuration Settings, click Edit Config File.
The Aud.ini file opens in the default Windows text editor.
3. In Aud.ini, locate the entry called MinimizeDriverStateChanges and set it to the desired value. For example:
MinimizeDriverStateChanges=1
Valid values are as follows:

 0 = off.
 1 = On for ASIO only (default).
 2 = On for WDM only.
 3 = On for both ASIO and WDM.
4. Save Aud.ini and close the Windows text editor.
5. Click Reload Config Settings to reload the current audio configuration settings from Aud.ini.
Note: The MinimizeDriverStateChanges variable only applies when using ASIO or WDM driver modes, not when using
the MME driver mode.

Improving performance with digital audio

1369

Queue buffers
Cakewalk allows you to set the number of queue buffers in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings. A higher number of
queue buffers will take longer to fill, and therefore cause an increase in latency. A lower number of queue buffers decreases latency,
but may cause “dropouts.” The default setting is 2. For more information, see “Mixing latency” on page 1368, and “Dropouts and
other audio problems” on page 1373.

CPU meter/Disk meter/Dropout indicator
Cakewalk has several tools to help you identify and correct audio problems, including the CPU meter and Disk meter in the Control
Bar’s Performance module, and the Dropout indicator in the Transport module.
Figure 566. The Transport module.

The Dropout Indicator
appears whenever your project requires more resources than your CPU, main memory, and disk can
supply. For details, see “Dropouts and other audio problems” on page 1373.

The Performance module contains the following controls:

 CPU meters. Displays the time it takes to process a buffer full of audio data as a percentage of the maximum time available to
process that data and maintain uninterrupted playback. There is one CPU meter for each in your computer, up to 32 cores. There
is some tolerance built into the meter, so it is possible that it will exceed 100% at times (more so during recording than playback).
Note: The width of the Performance module depends on the number of CPU cores available.

32 cores

4 cores

 Disk Activity indicator

. Measures how much of the available time Cakewalk is using to perform input/output functions on
your hard disk. The size of your setup’s I/O buffer size (listed under File System in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Sync and
Caching) determines how much time is allowed to perform disk operations and maintain uninterrupted playback. When Cakewalk
performs disk operations, the Disk Activity indicator changes color from yellow to red to indicate the time Cakewalk is taking to
complete each cycle of disk input/output. A red icon indicates very high data activity.

 Disk Space meter. Shows the amount of available space on the drive where your wave data directory is located. The tooltip
shows the actual remaining disk space on your audio disk.

 Memory Usage (RAM) meter. Shows the total memory (RAM) usage by your computer, not just by Cakewalk.
Note: If you experience a dropout or your CPU or Disk meters are reading high, there are steps you can take to improve your
audio performance. For more information, see “Audio dropouts or crashes during playback” on page 1432.

Reduce GUI updates to improve playback performance
Cakewalk has a CPU conservation mode that reduces the number of GUI updates with no effect on actual playback quality and
rendering. This maximizes CPU resources for the audio engine and can be useful while playing projects that consume a lot of CPU,
to help avoid dropouts.
Like the Scroll Lock key, the Pause key now works as a special GUI throttle toggle key. When the Pause key is pressed, Cakewalk
runs in a CPU conservation mode by reducing the frequency of GUI updates. For example, VU meter updates, Now position pointer
and progress updates will appear to update less frequently.
During CPU conservation mode, the UI is only updated once per second.
This mode can also be helpful to conserve CPU while doing a real-time bounce (see “Real-time bounce” on page 1050).

24-bit tips
Here are a few tips for playing back and/or recording at 24-bits:

 Try to play back at 24-bits even if your sound card only operates at 20- or 18-bits:
Having established the default settings for new files, you must also specify at what playback bit-depth you want your sound card
to use. In Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings, set the Audio Driver Bit Depth to the desired value. Even if your
sound card’s highest bit-depth is only 18- or 20-bits, you should try selecting an Audio Driver Bit Depth of 24 first. If you receive
an error message when doing so, try selecting 20. If this also produces an error message, try selecting 18. In other words, if you
want Cakewalk to operate your sound card at any bit-depth greater than 16-bits, try selecting the highest value possible in the
Audio Driver Bit Depth setting, and work downward from there if you have to.
(If your sound card’s maximum bit-depth is 20-bits and you specify an Audio Driver Bit Depth of 24 as advised above, audio
data will still be sampled by your sound card in 20-bit samples, but each sample will automatically be padded with extra 0’s to
produce a 24-bit sample, which will be stored at full 24-bit resolution in your project file.

 Some 24-bit cards require you to configure the order in which data is streamed:
If necessary, go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings and select one of the following options in the Stream > 16-bit
data as list:

 3 bytes
 4 bytes, right justified
 4 bytes, left justified
 32-bit PCM, right justified
 32-bit PCM, left justified
These settings affect how 24-bit audio samples are transferred from the sound card into the Cakewalk software, and affect the
efficiency of the transfer. You’ll get the best performance from this card when working at 24-bits if you use the correct setting for
your sound card. If you’re not sure whether your particular sound card requires these settings, consult the documentation that
came with your sound card. You should also check the web page www.cakewalk.com/Support/Knowledge-Base/AudioHardware-Setup-Guide to see if any information is available there regarding configuration of your particular sound card in
Cakewalk. When in doubt, leave these settings disabled.
(These settings are only relevant when working with sound cards at >16 bits-per-sample. You can ignore them when operating at
normal 16-bit depth.)

 Using 24-bit depth and/or high sampling rate can be costly:
While using 24-bit audio can improve the sound quality of your recordings, there are some important drawbacks to keep in mind.
Projects stored at 24-bit depth will require 50% more disk space than those stored at 16-bits; if you have a large number of audio
tracks (and keep in mind that stereo tracks require twice as much data as mono tracks!), your audio project file can grow very
large and use up lots of disk space. Also note that recording, playing, and processing 24-bit data utilizes more CPU resources
than working with 16-bit data. This means that for a given computer configuration, you will be able to record/play/process a
smaller number of total simultaneous tracks, and use a smaller number of simultaneous real-time effects, in a 24-bit project than
you would be able to in a 16-bit project. This is also true when working at higher sampling rates (i.e., a 24-bit/96khz project
requires substantially more computing resources than a corresponding 16-bit/44.1khz project). Depending on the size of your
project and the configuration of your computer (CPU, RAM, disk), you may need to reconsider whether working at the higher bitdepth/sampling rate is justified or even possible.
Some plug-ins do not function well at a 96 kHz sampling rate.
Using an audio bit depth of 24 can enhance the performance of some plug-ins, but raising the sampling rate to 96 kHz does not offer
much improvement, and can cause some plug-ins to add unintended artifacts to the sound. Using a 24-bit, 44.1 kHz setup for your
audio provides plenty of enhanced performance for plug-ins that can take advantage of it, without risking the problems that 96 kHz
audio causes with some plug-ins.
It’s also worth noting that not all audio projects benefit equally from the use of higher bit-depth/sampling rates. Most professional
sound engineers will tell you that 24-bit, higher-sampling-rate audio is most beneficial when working with music that focuses on
natural acoustic instruments and/or vocals recorded with very high-quality microphones. The benefits of 24-bit/high-sampling-rate
recording are less audible when working with highly synthetic or highly compressed program material, often found in contemporary
popular music. You must make your own judgment about whether the benefits of higher-capacity audio justify the extra demands it
places on your computer.
Note: Red Book Audio CDs are still 16-bit (44.1 sampling rate), so if your goal is to burn a CD, you will have to mix down to 16bit.

Dropouts and other audio problems
If your Cakewalk application suddenly stops producing audio while in the midst of recording or playback, you've very likely
experienced a “dropout.” Sometimes instead of a dropout, you may experience a “stutter” during playback (a small section of audio
repeats itself once or twice before normal playback resumes). Or, you may occasionally experience a “glitch” or “pop” during audio
playback (a brief interruption or clicking noise is heard, but audio playback then continues normally from that point). It is also
possible to experience a dropout while working exclusively with MIDI (i.e., no audio data in the project).
During recording, the sound card sends incoming audio data to the sound card driver, which in turn sends audio data to Cakewalk to
store on hard disk. When playing back, Cakewalk reads audio data from the hard disk and feeds it to the sound card driver, which in
turn passes it to the sound card for audible output. If these activities can't be completed fast enough, or if the communication
between Cakewalk and the sound card driver is broken in some way, recording and/or playback will be disturbed. To protect you
from unwanted noise or glitches, the audio engine as a protective measure will stop playback.
While CPU load is one of the most common causes for dropouts, there are a variety of other reasons under which the audio engine
may be stopped. When a dropout occurs, playback stops and a toast notification will show the detected dropout reason code. This
code can be useful in tracking down the reason for dropouts.

A
A. Dropout reason code

The following table describes the most common dropout reason codes along with potential preventative action that may be taken.

Code

Reason for dropout

0

Unknown error or no dropout.

1

Audio processing took longer than the buffers allotted time
slice.

Increase the Buffer Size value in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver
Settings.

2

Buffer underrun while processing or error writing record
buffers.

Possible CPU overload or driver malfunction. Increase latency and check
disk status.

3

Driver did not request audio buffers for over DropoutMsec
milliseconds. Possible driver overload.

Increase audio latency.
Increase the DropoutMsec variable value in AUD.ini (see “AUD.INI” on
page 1470), which lets you configure the tolerance time in milliseconds
before dropping if the audio pump mechanism becomes starved (default is
250 ms).

4

WDM/MME/WASAPI output buffer not available for delivery
to audio device.

Increase the Buffers in Playback Queue value in Edit > Preferences >
Audio - Driver Settings.

5

Disk reading overloaded and could not keep up with
playback pump.
Disk may be fragmented or too slow to read.

Increase the Playback I/O Buffer Size value in Edit > Preferences >
Audio - Sync and Caching.
Defragment audio drive or compacting audio files by saving to a bundle
and reloading may also help.

6

[Internal] Error filling disk playback buffer cache.

Disk may be full condition or disk read error. Check disk status.

7

[Internal] Error reading from disk playback buffer cache.

Possible memory corruption. Close and restart the application then reload
the project.

8

Disk full or error writing record wave files.

Make sure the disk is not read only and has sufficient free space.

9

Table 95.

Audio engine dropout reason codes (Continued)

While dropout messages may be useful to diagnose the cause of problems, they can be intrusive to workflow when small audio
interruptions are inconsequential, such as when editing projects, loading and saving sessions, etc.
Cakewalk can intelligently mask certain categories of dropout notifications when they are less important. The following dropout
codes are considered maskable since they are caused by CPU load issues, while other dropouts are caused by system events that
cannot be resumed from easily:

 Dropout code 1: Audio processing took longer than the buffers allotted time slice.
 Dropout code 3: Driver did not request audio buffers for over DropoutMsec milliseconds (see “AUD.INI” on page 1470). Possible
driver overload.
Dropouts are masked in the following scenarios:

 The application is idling (transport is not running)
 Performing various editing operations
 Performing real time bounce/export/freeze (rendered data will be free of glitches even if the audio playback contains glitches, as
long as you are not rendering external hardware inserts)

 Playing back using the Play List view
 Opening and closing views
 Opening and closing documents
 Operating screen sets
 Mix Recall
Handling dropouts during playback and recording
Under normal conditions, Cakewalk always stops playback or recording if too many late buffers are encountered while playing.
However there may be circumstances where a dropout that stops playback is disruptive, such as when doing an unattended
recording or playing back in a live scenario.
To handle these cases, a new MaskDropoutDetection option in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Configuration File can be used
to suppress dropouts.

1374

Improving audio performance
Improving performance with digital audio

Setting this value to True will activate dropout masking during playback and recording.
When activated, Cakewalk will continue playback and recording after it encounters a maskable dropout. This can prevent unwanted
interruption of playback or a lost take while recording.

Note:
• If the dropouts are extreme, recorded audio may contain glitches. Please follow the normal dropout diagnosis procedure for
minimizing dropouts.
• The Play List view will always ignore dropouts irrespective of this setting.
• Only CPU load related dropouts are masked. Other dropouts such as driver requested stops or disk underruns will still cause
playback to stop.

Causes and cures
The exact cause of your audio problem will vary depending on the configuration of your computer and/or the content of the project
file you're working with. The majority of audio problems are caused by one of the factors listed here. Read each of the following
topics, in the order shown, and follow the recommendations provided:
“The CPU is being interrupted by “background” activities having nothing to do with audio” on page 1376
“Cakewalk doesn't properly “recognize” your sound card” on page 1376
“The “I/O Buffer Size” may not be well matched to your hard disk” on page 1377
“Mixing latency may be set too low” on page 1377
“Your hard disk may be excessively fragmented” on page 1377
“Your project file may be excessively fragmented” on page 1377
“Your sound card's driver may be obsolete” on page 1378
“There may be a conflict with your video card or other multimedia streaming card” on page 1378
“Your sound card may have a conflict with another device in your computer” on page 1379
“Your project may simply be too “complex” for your computer” on page 1380
“Upgrade your computer hardware: more RAM, a faster CPU, and a faster disk drive” on page 1380

The CPU is being interrupted by “background” activities having nothing to do with audio
Turn off these other activities, so your CPU can process audio without interruption:

 Turn off the Microsoft Office FastFind option if present on your system.
 Don't use any scheduled background tasks (e.g., tasks which are part of the Windows Plus package, or which you have
scheduled yourself using the Windows Task Scheduler utility).

 Discontinue use of any networking or communications applications on your computer. For example, don't run email programs (like
Microsoft Outlook), Web browsers, or AOL client software while you are running Cakewalk. These programs send and receive
chunks of information over a modem or a network connection; when one of these data chunks is sent or received, your CPU may
be unexpectedly interrupted from Cakewalk audio processing to deal with the modem or network data. That interruption can
disrupt the smooth processing of audio data, causing a dropout or glitch. If possible, you should disconnect your computer from a
local area network, and/or disconnect from any dial-up telecommunications while recording or playing back audio in Cakewalk.

 Turn off your screen saver (if present).
 Turn off the Auto-Notification option for your CD-ROM drive. If it is turned on, the insertion of a CD-ROM can interrupt audio
processing.
To disable it, open the System applet in the Control panel, click on the Device Manager tab, expand the CD-ROM list entry,
double-click on the listed CD-ROM device, click on the Settings tab, and clear the Auto Insert Notification check box.

 Disable any kind of virus scanning program that might be running in the background. To find out what programs are currently
running, press the CTRL-ALT-DELETE keys simultaneously to display the Windows Task Manager; if you see an anti-Virus
program shown on the list of currently running tasks, select that program and click End Task.

 If Cakewalk's Auto Save feature is enabled, disable it.
 Remove all programs from the Windows Start Up folder (\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Start Up).
Cakewalk doesn't properly “recognize” your sound card
Re-run the Cakewalk Wave Profiler, which will attempt to analyze your sound card and establish proper settings for it:

 Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings and click the Wave Profiler button.
 If Wave Profiler offers you the chance to use “default settings” for your sound card, accept the defaults, close the Preferences
dialog box, and check audio playback/recording.

 If problem(s) continue, re-run the Wave Profiler, but this time do not accept any default settings.
 If you decline to use default settings (or if Wave Profiler can't find any for your sound card), Wave Profiler will analyze your sound
card's capabilities by running some tests and automatically establish appropriate settings based on the test results.

 If your sound card is listed at www.cakewalk.com/Support/Knowledge-Base/Audio-Hardware-Setup-Guide, read and follow any
special card-specific operating instructions listed there.

 Re-test audio recording/playback. If problem(s) persist, go to the Next Step.

Improving performance with digital audio

The “I/O Buffer Size” may not be well matched to your hard disk
Cakewalk may be reading and writing audio data to/from your hard disk in chunks that are either too large or too small for your
particular hard disk's characteristics.
Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Sync and Caching and try different values for Playback I/O Buffer Size and Record I/O
Buffer Size until you find values that works well for your particular hard disk:

 The default value is 64. Try reducing this value, to 32, then 16. After each change, close the dialog box (click OK) and re-test your
project's recording/playback behavior.

 If problem(s) persist, try increasing this value, to 128, then 256, then 512. Again, close the dialog box and re-try your project after
each change.

 If you have an older, slower computer or an older, slower hard disk, you should try increasing the buffer size; decreasing is not
advised on slower hardware. However, increasing this setting uses more of your computer's RAM. If you have a smaller amount
of RAM in your computer, increasing the buffer size may not help.
If problem(s) persist, restore this value to its default and continue with the next step.

Mixing latency may be set too low
Cakewalk tries to send and receive audio data to/from your sound card with very a minimal delay (so that any real-time adjustments
you make to a track's volume, pan, or other settings will take effect rapidly). If the latency setting is set too low, the sound card driver
may not be able to keep up with the Cakewalk, and audio will be disrupted.
Try higher latency settings:

 Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings. Move the Mixing Latency Buffer Size slider control to the right in small
increments until you see the value to the right of the slider increase; close the dialog box (click OK) and re-test your project after
each increment.

 If problem(s) continue, move the slider control back to its original position, and try increasing the number in the Buffers in
Playback Queue text box. (This value starts out at 4; try increasing it to 5, 6, 7, or 8). Close the dialog box (click OK) and re-test
your project after each such change.

 The total effective latency is displayed below the slider; it is determined by multiplying the per-buffer latency time (in msec) by the
number of buffers in the playback queue.

Your hard disk may be excessively fragmented
Audio data can be processed most efficiently if it is arranged in consecutive physical locations on your hard drive. Over time, the
chunks become distributed at various discontiguous locations on your disk, which makes it more time consuming for Cakewalk to
access the chunks. This extra access time can interfere with smooth audio recording and/or playback.
Try defragmenting the hard disk:

 Make sure Cakewalk, and the Wave data directory are not installed on a compressed hard disk.
 Defragment your hard disk. If you have more than one hard disk in your computer, identify the disk which contains the Cakewalk
Data directory (this is where your projects’ audio clips are stored.) To defragment the hard disk, exit Cakewalk first. Then, select
Start > Programs > System Tools > Accessories > Disk Defragmenter. We recommend that you backup your hard disk before
defragmenting it.

Your project file may be excessively fragmented
Audio data can be processed most efficiently if it is arranged in consecutive physical locations on your hard drive. During normal
Cakewalk usage, a project's audio data can become fragmented into chunks stored at discontiguous locations on your disk.
Accessing these discontiguous chunks can consume extra processing time, which can lead to dropouts.
Try defragmenting your project file:
1. Open the project file that has audio problems.
2. Save it as a Cakewalk Bundle (.cwb) file by selecting Save As from the File menu and selecting Cakewalk Bundle from the
Save As Type drop-down list and clicking the Save button.
3. Close the project.
4. Open the Cakewalk Bundle you just closed
Saving then re-opening the bundle file automatically defragments the audio data used by the project, reducing the chances of a
dropout or other audio problem.
When you are ready to save the file again, you may want to save it as a normal (.cwp) file. Saving and opening .cwp files takes less
time than saving and opening bundle files.

Your sound card's driver may be obsolete
Obtain and install a new sound card driver (if available):

 Consult your sound card manufacturer's website (or contact their Customer Service department) to check for the availability of a
later driver version. If one exists, obtain it and install it on your computer according to their instructions. With the new driver
installed, restart the computer, then delete the file cw9auddx.ini from your Cakewalk folder. Launch Cakewalk and let it reprofile your audio hardware. When it's done, re-test your audio recording/playback.

 If problem(s) persist, continue with the next step.
There may be a conflict with your video card or other multimedia streaming card
Some video drivers contain bugs which can interfere with Cakewalk's operation. Or, the driver may be “stealing” excessive CPU time
away from Cakewalk (some video card vendors, in an attempt to make their cards operate faster, supply drivers that tie up the
computer's bus for relatively long intervals (so-called “PCI bus contention”). This can interrupt the smooth flow of audio data between
Cakewalk and the sound card's driver.)
Try to remove the video card conflict as follows:

 Try turning off “hardware acceleration” on your video card (if available). This may cause more sluggish screen drawing, but may
improve the flow of audio data to your sound card, thereby reducing the possibility of dropouts.
To disable the hardware acceleration on your graphics card: Launch Control panel (Start > Settings > Control panel). Doubleclick the Display icon. Select the Settings tab. Click on the Advanced Properties button. Select the Performance tab. Move
the slider for Hardware Acceleration one notch at a time toward ‘none’ and re-test your recording/playback after each such
adjustment. If problem(s) persist, leave the slider at ‘none’ and proceed with the next step.

 Try Using the Windows driver for your specific sound card (instead of the manufacturer's driver).
 Try using the standard VGA/SVGA drivers provided with Windows (instead of the drivers provided by the manufacturer).
 Check your video card manufacturer's website for a later driver version. If a newer driver is available, download it and install it on
your computer following the manufacturer's instructions.

 If you have an STB Velocity 128 card, and your graphics card was configured and shipped with a new computer, you may
want to check the computer vendor’s website (instead of STB’s site) to see if they offer a driver update for the STB card.
Computer vendors often will customize drivers to their specific needs and you should use their driver updates.

 Try reducing the number of colors used by your video card. 16-, 24-, or 32-bit true color display settings can severely hamper realtime audio performance on some computers; using fewer colors allows your computer to spend more of its processing time on
audio and MIDI.
You can adjust color depth by right-clicking on your Windows desktop, clicking Properties, clicking on the Settings tab, and
selecting a suitable entry in the Colors list. Also, try reducing the display resolution. Re-test your audio playback/recording with
these changes.

 If you have one of the following specific video cards, applying the following card-specific .ini file settings can reduce PCI bus
contention problems.

 If you have a Hercules Dynamite 128 card:
Open the System.ini file in Notepad (or any text editor). In the section called [Hercules], check to ensure that this line is
present:
Optimization=1
(The default is 0; if necessary, edit the value to 1 and save the file. Restart Windows.

 If you have a Matrox Millenium card:
Open the System.ini file in Notepad (or any text editor). In the section called [mga.drv], add the following line:
Pcichipset=1
Edit the file as necessary, and save the file. Restart Windows.
If you have an early Matrox video card, Disable Use PowerGDI acceleration:
(Start > Settings > Control panel > Display > MGA Settings > Advanced > Performance)
If you have a later Matrox video card, enable Use Bus Mastering and Disable use Automatic PCI Busd Retries:
(Start > Settings > Control panel > Display > Settings > PowerDesk button)

 If you have a card based on the S3 chipset (S3, Inc. provides graphics chips for other manufacturers; consult your card
manufacturer’s website to see if that card is S3-based):
Open the System.ini file in Notepad (or any text editor). In the section called [display], make sure the following line is
present:
BusThrottle=1
Edit as necessary, and save the file. Restart Windows.

 If problem(s) persist, continue with the next step.
Your sound card may have a conflict with another device in your computer
Try resolving this device conflict as follows:

 Ensure that your sound card is not sharing IRQs with any other device. Although some sound cards claim that they work properly
on a shared IRQ, this is usually not the case and it is advisable to avoid such sharing. To do this, right click on My Computer and
select Properties from the pop-up menu. In the System Properties dialog box, click on the Device Manager tab, then doubleclick on the Computer icon at the top of the list. This allows you to look at all the devices on your system and which IRQs they are
using. Scroll through the list until you see your sound card. Check the IRQ setting to the left of the icon. If there are other devices
(such as a video card) that are assigned to the same IRQ, you should try moving your sound card to a different slot in your
computer. Note that entries which say something like “IRQ Holder for PCI Steering” do not indicate conflicting devices, and can be
ignored.

 Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Devices and make sure that only your sound card's input and output drivers are highlighted
in both menus. (If you have more than one sound card installed in your system, try using only a single sound card and deselecting
the other(s). If you can get audio to record/playback properly on a single sound card, but you encounter problems using two
sound cards simultaneously, there may be a conflict between the two sound cards. Contact Cakewalk Technical Support for
assistance in this event.)

 If problem(s) continue, another multimedia audio device on your system (like a built-in sound card or voice modem) could be
interfering with your sound card's functionality. To see if this is the cause of your problem(s), you'll have to temporarily disable
these other devices. Note that this may cause other programs which rely on these other devices to no longer work correctly.
To disable these other device(s), in Windows go to the Control Panel, and double-click the Multimedia icon. Click the Advanced
tab, and click the plus sign next to Audio Devices. Double-click any audio devices listed there that AREN'T the sound card, and
choose Do Not Use Audio Features on This Device. Click OK, and repeat this step for any non-sound card device, including
voice modems, 'virtual audio devices' or 'game-compatible devices'. Once the sound card is the only device left, click OK, and
restart the computer. After restarting, delete the file cw9auddx.ini from your Cakewalk folder. Once you've deleted those files,
launch Cakewalk, and let it profile your audio hardware. When it's done, try playing your audio again.

 If problem(s) continue, try deselecting any MIDI devices which you might be using. In Cakewalk, go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI
- Devices and deselect every MIDI device in both Inputs and Outputs, then when Cakewalk asks, select Continue with no MIDI
input and Continue with no MIDI output, and try re-test your audio recording/playback.

 If problem(s) persist, reselect your audio and MIDI devices, and continue with the next step.

Your project may simply be too “complex” for your computer
Your computer may not have enough processing power to deal with all of the tracks, clips, and real-time effects used in your project.
You can upgrade your computer hardware (see “Upgrade your computer hardware: more RAM, a faster CPU, and a faster disk
drive” on page 1380) or you can simplify your project’s content so it demands less processing power.
If possible, try reducing the complexity of your project in any of the following ways:

 Reduce the number of real-time effects used in your project. Instead of generating the effects in real-time (nondestructively)
during playback, consider applying the effects offline (destructively), before beginning playback.

 Reduce the number of distinct tracks being played back simultaneously. Consider “sub-mixing” several of your audio tracks into
one track (using the Track view Tracks > Bounce to Track command), and then archiving the individual tracks which were
combined in the sub-mix. (Archived tracks don’t use up any CPU resources during playback, leaving more CPU resources
available to properly play the non-archived tracks.)

 Where possible, record audio using a mono source, rather than a stereo source. Mono clips require less processing power than
stereo clips.

 Avoid using overlapping audio clips. Where possible, combine/blend overlapping clips into a single clip, which uses less
processing power.

 Thin the amount of MIDI controller data and the number of SysEx messages in your tracks.
 If you can't reduce your project's complexity, or if problems persist even after the complexity has been reduced, proceed to the
next step.

Upgrade your computer hardware: more RAM, a faster CPU, and a faster disk drive
If your project makes extensive use of real-time effects (plug-ins), you should consider upgrading to a faster CPU. If your primary
concern is playing or recording a large number of tracks, a faster CPU will help, but you may find that adding more RAM, a faster
hard disk, and/or an improved hard disk controller may help even more.
The following are some tips on upgrading your hardware:
Audio problems are often caused by a hard disk which is transferring data too slowly. The disk could simply be physically incapable
of reading and writing data fast enough, or the disk controller could be causing too much CPU time to be consumed when
transferring audio data to/from the disk.
Consider upgrading your equipment as follows:

 Ensure that your hard drive controller is NOT configured to operate in “compatibility mode” which can greatly slow data transfer to/
from your hard disk and make it almost impossible to record/play audio in Cakewalk reliably. To do this, go to the Control Panel
and double-click on the System icon. Click the Performance tab. At the top of the Performance screen read the entries across
from File Systems and Virtual Memory. They both need to say 32-bit. If they mention MS-DOS Compatibility Mode, then your
computer has a serious problem, beyond the scope of what a Cakewalk technician can fix. Your computer is processing the audio
data very slowly and Cakewalk will not work properly until the MS-DOS Compatibility Mode problem is eliminated. Help is
available on the Microsoft Technical Support Web page at www.microsoft.com/Support. Click on the Support Online link and
search for the phrase Troubleshooting MS-DOS Compatibility Mode on Hard Disks. This problem can arise when installing a
new hard disk in your computer; if Windows cannot find a suitable driver for the disk, it installs a generic driver and operates in
Compatibility Mode.

 If you're using a hard disk controller that employs “programmed I/O”, upgrade to a disk controller that uses “bus mastering”
instead. (This is sometimes also known as an UltraDMA IDE Controller). The former technique relies on the CPU to transfer the
data to/from the hard disk, stealing cycles which the CPU could be sending audio data to/from the sound card. With the latter
technique, the hard disk controller itself is primarily responsible for transferring the data to/from the hard disk, relieving the CPU of
much of that burden.

 Install a faster hard disk. If you're using an IDE- or E-IDE-type hard drive, try to find one which has a lower disk access time (e.g.,
less than 9msec). Use the Win Tune test application available at www.winmag.com, this diagnostic tool measures your hard
drive's uncached transfer rate.

There is also an option in the Associated Audio Files dialog box to selectively redraw waveforms for individual clips that may
have a corrupt waveform display (see “To redraw waveforms” on page 1381).

.INI file picture cache options
3 new INI file variables that are used by picture cache generation and display:

 In Aud.ini:
In the [Aud] section:
EnablePicCacheThreads=1 (default)
This option creates extra background worker threads for the generation of wave pictures when you load a project. One worker
thread is automatically created per CPU/. Setting EnablePicCacheThreads=0 reverts back to only using a single thread for
picture computation.
If you are running a system with multiple CPU's or cores setting this to 1 can greatly speed up the computation of pictures.
Notes:
-These threads are only active while the picture is being computed.
-This option is only applicable on multiprocessor/multicore systems.
Also in the [Aud] section:
ComputePicturesWhilePlaying=1 (default)
This option allows waveform pictures to be computed in the background while audio playback is in progress. Most modern
computers should be able to handle this load with no problems. Note that work is only done while new pictures are actually being
computed—once the pictures are finished rendering there is no overhead.

 In Cakewalk.ini:
In the [WinCake] section:
ProgressiveWavePictures=1 [default]
This option enables progressive display of waveform pictures. When enabled you will see pictures being displayed in the clips
view dynamically as they are being computed. The waveforms will update in the background when the application is idle. If the
ComputePicturesWhilePlaying flag is set to 1, waveforms will continue being displayed progressively even while audio
playback is in progress. This can save time waiting for a complete picture to be finished before you can see it.

To redraw waveforms
1. Select the clips that you want to redraw.
2. Right-click a selected clip, and choose Associated Audio Files on the pop-up menu to open the Associated Audio Files dialog
box.
3. Click the Recompute Picture(s) button. A dialog box appears, asking if you want to recompute the pictures on the selected
clips.
4. Click OK.

Improving recording performance
EnableCacheWriteThru=<0 or 1>, default = 1
This Aud.ini variable enables disk write thru caching, on by default. When write thru caching is on, data recorded to wave files is
written to the hard disk immediately, circumventing the hardware disk cache. Having write thru caching off can be more efficient for
disk I/O but can result in data loss if your system crashes.

MIDI Prepare Buffer Size and automation
If your project contains several track/clip automation envelopes, setting your MIDI playback buffer size too low (in Edit >
Preferences > MIDI - Playback and Recording) can cause audio to crackle if your audio latency is also set very low. This problem
will be somewhat worse if you enable multiprocessing in the audio engine. To minimize or eliminate these crackles, please be sure to
keep your MIDI playback buffers at or above the default setting of 250 msec.

Using audio devices in Windows 7
Cakewalk introduces several enhancements for communicating with audio devices in Windows 7, including:

 Support for WASAPI, which is the new standard for audio in Windows 7 and future Windows operating systems.
 MMCSS task profile support.
 Optimized WaveRT streaming.
See:
“WASAPI support” on page 1382
“MMCSS task profile support” on page 1384
“WaveRT updates” on page 1384

WASAPI support
Cakewalk provides support for WASAPI (Windows Audio Session API), which is the new standard for audio in Windows 7 and future
Windows operating systems.
The primary advantages of WASAPI are:

 Better compatibility with consumer audio devices:
 Supports a wide variety of audio devices, including newer WaveRT devices and legacy Windows audio devices.
 Lets you use consumer audio devices that don’t have ASIO drivers or drivers that don’t work well under WDM.
 Provides low latency access to audio devices.
Using WASAPI
WASAPI has four different modes of operation. Cakewalk supports WASAPI Exclusive mode and WASAPI Shared mode.
Exclusive mode provides low latency audio and direct access to the audio driver, bypassing the Windows audio engine. The
disadvantage is that only one application can access the driver in Exclusive mode.
Shared mode allows multiple applications to access the audio driver. When Shared mode is selected, Windows will mix the audio
output from Cakewalk along with audio from other apps such as YouTube. One advantage of Windows 10 is that WASAPI Shared
mode supports low latency playback and recording at buffer sizes down to 2 milliseconds. In Windows 7, WASAPI Shared mode is
less efficient and requires higher latency since it uses polling to access the driver.
In order to use WASAPI in Cakewalk, your audio device must have WDM drivers that Windows can successfully communicate with.
In order to use WASAPI Exclusive mode, the audio device must be enabled to work in Exclusive mode.
Exclusive mode is the default in Windows 7 and can be configured from your audio device’s taskbar or Properties dialog box in
Device Manager. Consult your audio device’s manual if you need further information.
Exclusive mode requires exclusive access to the audio device. Another program will not be able to use the audio device
simultaneously with Cakewalk.
Tip: If you select Suspend Audio Engine When Cakewalk Is Not in Focus in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and
Recording, Cakewalk will relinquish control of the audio device when the program loses Windows focus.

1382

Improving audio performance
Using audio devices in Windows 7

To enable WASAPI mode in Cakewalk
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording.
2. In the Driver Mode list, select WASAPI Exclusive or WASAPI Shared.
3. Select the Audio - Devices page tab (Edit > Preferences > Audio - Devices).
4. In the Input Drivers and Output Drivers lists, select the desired input and output ports.
5. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.

To enable/disable built-in DSP
In Windows 10, WASAPI Shared mode has support for configuring built-in signal processing for inputs and output independently.
Many onboard audio devices have built in DSP, such as Dolby audio enhancement of audio outputs and noise reduction for audio
inputs. While these effects may be desirable for better quality audio from laptops (for example, for noise gating of microphone
inputs), the DSP processing of these effects can cause latency.
Cakewalk allows you to enable or disable DSP effects on inputs and output devices in WASAPI Shared mode. This is done via the
EnableWasapiDSP variable in Aud.ini. By default, Cakewalk enables endpoint DSP effects for input devices (for noise
removal).
To configure the built-in signal processing for inputs and outputs:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Configuration File.
2. Under Configuration Settings, click Edit Config File.
The Aud.ini file opens in the default Windows text editor.
3. In Aud.ini, add a new entry called EnableWasapiDSP in the [Wave] section, and set its value to the minimum desired buffer
sample value. For example:
[Wave]
EnableWasapiDSP=0
Valid values are as follows:

 0 = Disable all signal processing for inputs and outputs (RAW mode)
 1 = Enable signal processing for inputs (default)
 2 = Enable signal processing for outputs
 3 = Enable signal processing for inputs and outputs
4. Save Aud.ini and close the Windows text editor.
5. Click Reload Config Settings to reload the current audio configuration settings from Aud.ini.

Note: Setting the EnableWasapiDSP variable to 2 or 3 will result in a minimum latency of 5 milliseconds in Cakewalk when
using WASAPI Shared mode.

1383

MMCSS task profile support
The Multimedia Class Scheduler Service (MMCSS) provides Windows multimedia programs, including Cakewalk, with prioritized
access to CPU resources for time-sensitive processing.
By default, Cakewalk uses the MMCSS task profile named Pro Audio. If desired, you can instruct Cakewalk to use a custom
MMCSS task profile.

To use a custom MMCSS task profile in Cakewalk
1. Determine the name of the MMCSS task profile that you want to use. MMCSS task profiles are listed in the Windows registry
under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Multimedia\SystemProfile\Tasks.
Ensure that the registry entry exists for the profile you want to use.
2. If you have added any new profiles, reboot your computer to allow the MMCSS service to see the new profiles.
3. In Cakewalk, go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Configuration File.
4. Under Configuration Settings, click Edit Config File.
The Aud.ini file opens in the default Windows text editor.
5. In Aud.ini, locate the entry called MMCSSTaskKey and set it to the desired profile name. For example:
MMCSSTaskKey=Pro Audio
6. Save Aud.ini and close the Windows text editor.
7. Click Reload Config Settings to reload the current audio configuration settings from Aud.ini.
Cakewalk will now use the new task profile for MMCSS.

WaveRT updates
Cakewalk supports WaveRT in two ways:
WDM driver mode. WaveRT event mode access is available in Cakewalk when you are using WDM as a driver mode and a
WaveRT capable audio device is detected. A [WaveRT] suffix is added to the driver name in this case.
WASAPI driver mode. Event mode WaveRT drivers are automatically listed and available in WASAPI mode.

External devices

Cakewalk can be controlled by a wide range of MIDI controllers and external MIDI devices. Cakewalk also contains two generic
controller/surface plug-ins (the ACT MIDI Controller plug-in, and the Cakewalk Generic Surface Plug-in), which allow you to use
almost any MIDI controller or controller/surface with Cakewalk. You can also control certain external devices from Cakewalk by using
StudioWare or OPT (Open Plug-in Technology) panels.
Cakewalk allows you to control soft synths as well as effect plug-ins. Active Controller Technology (ACT) allows you to control any
plug-in that has focus, using the same widget mappings for each instance of the same plug-in. You can also choose to lock a
particular controller/surface to a particular instance of a plug-in.
Note: Some older plug-ins do not support ACT.

To keep track of your mappings, Cakewalk displays different-colored markers on each track and/or bus to show you which controller/
surface is currently controlling that particular module. These visual markers on tracks and buses are called the WAI display (Where
Am I).
Cakewalk includes preset mappings for popular controllers/surfaces and MIDI controllers such as the Roland A-PRO series. If
Cakewalk does not currently include preset mappings for your controller/surface, you can create mappings by using the built-in ACT
MIDI Controller Plug-in or Cakewalk Generic Surface Plug-in.

Roland A-PRO controllers
Cakewalk has a custom controller/surface plug-in that allows a Roland A-PRO controller to control Cakewalk track, bus, and plug-in
parameters (both effects and synths). This includes support for ACT (Active Controller Technology), which lets you use your
controller to adjust plug-in parameters on whatever plug-in currently has focus.
Figure 569. The A-PRO control surface plug-in enables full control of all Cakewalk tracks, buses, plug-ins and other parameters from your A-PRO
MIDI keyboard controller.

Setting up control surfaces
If you are not using a Roland A-PRO controller, use the following procedures to connect or disconnect your controller/surface:

To enable MIDI Input and Output drivers
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices.
2. In the Inputs list, make sure that the MIDI Input driver or drivers that your controller/surface uses are selected.
3. If you have a bi-directional controller/surface (one that both sends and receives data in order to control a software application),
also make sure that the MIDI Output driver or drivers that the controller/surface uses are enabled in the Outputs pane on the right
side of the dialog box.
4. Click OK.

To connect a controller/surface to Cakewalk
1. Follow your controller/surface’s instructions for physically connecting your controller/surface to your computer (you may need to
close Cakewalk first).
2. In Cakewalk, go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Control Surfaces.
3. Click the Add Controller/Surface button

, which opens the Controller/Surface Settings dialog box.

4. In the Controller/Surface field of the Controller/Surface Settings dialog box, find the name of your controller/surface, and
select it. However, if you want to use Active Controller Technology, or if your controller/surface is not listed, select either the
Cakewalk Generic Surface or the ACT MIDI Controller.
Note: The Cakewalk Generic Surface plug-in is not bi-directional.

5. In the Input Port and Output Port fields, select which MIDI input and output ports the controller/surface uses.
Note 1: You may need to read the documentation for your controller/surface to find out which MIDI input driver your controller/
surface uses to control software applications. If your controller/surface includes a MIDI keyboard, your controller/surface might
use one MIDI input driver for the controller/surface functions, and a different MIDI input driver to send MIDI notes and pitch bend
data to the application (the piano keyboard functions).

Note 2: Control surfaces retain their current MIDI port assignments even if you add or remove MIDI devices.
If any assigned MIDI port is missing when you load a project, Cakewalk will let you remap each missing port to an available port. For
more information, see “Changing MIDI Output devices” on page 251.
6. Click OK to close the Controller/Surface Settings dialog box.
7. In the Preferences dialog box, make sure that both the ACT and WAI check boxes are enabled, and click Close.
Important: If your controller/surface needs to be in a certain mode, or have a certain memory preset loaded in order to control
a software application, put your controller/surface in the proper mode or load the required memory preset now.
Now that your controller/surface is connected, you can see which tracks and/or buses are being controlled by it by looking at the
colored markings (the WAI display; see “The WAI display” on page 1401 for more information) in Cakewalk’s interface.
If you selected the ACT MIDI Controller plug-in or the Cakewalk Generic Surface plug-in for your controller/surface, you can load a
default set of mappings by opening the property page for either plug-in, and selecting the name of your controller/surface from the
Presets window in the property page.

You may want to increase the value of this Cakewalk.ini variable if you are experiencing sluggish UI responsiveness when using
a control surface and playing back high CPU projects.
Also, if you are using a control surface that is not bi-directional, the surface does not need to be refreshed at all and you can safely
increase the value.
This variable should be set in the [Wincake] section. For example:
[Wincake]
CtrlSurfaceRefreshMS=75

ACT MIDI Controller plug-in
The ACT MIDI Controller plug-in can be configured to support any generic MIDI controller (controller/surface), such as the JL
Cooper FaderMaster, Peavey PC-1600, and Kenton Control Freak. Generic controllers/surfaces typically have 8-16 strips of faders/
knobs/buttons, are non-motorized, and can often be configured to transmit any MIDI message (continuous controllers, NRPNs,
Sysx, etc.). The ACT MIDI Controller supports ACT.
After you have connected your controller/surface, and selected the ACT MIDI Controller plug-in in Edit > Preferences > MIDI Control Surfaces (see “Setting up control surfaces” on page 1388 if necessary), open the ACT MIDI Controller property page, and
select a preset for your controller/surface (load the default mappings).

To open the ACT MIDI Controller property page
1. In the Control Bar’s ACT module, make sure that ACT MIDI Controller appears in the drop-down menu. If you can’t find it in the
drop-down menu, you need to add it in Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Control Surfaces (see “Setting up control surfaces” on
page 1388 if necessary).

To edit default mappings
 On the Options tab, in the Rotaries, Sliders, or Buttons fields, choose the Bank of parameter mappings that you want to edit,
then select a new parameter for that Bank. For example, if in the Rotaries field, you select Bank 4, and the parameter field next
to the Bank field now reads Send 2 Pan, you could select Send 2 Vol instead. If you then click the Controllers tab, and select
Bank 4 in the Bank menu that’s in the rotaries row, the rotary knobs will now control Send 2 Volume on all the tracks currently
under control. If you have at least 2 sends in each track, the Rotary fields on the Controllers tab will now display the name and
current level of each Send 2 in the controlled tracks.
You can restore the default parameter assignments by clicking the Defaults button.
If you want to choose a different knob or other control to control a specific cell in the property page (the MIDI Learn function), see
“Assigning controls on your controller/surface to cells in the ACT MIDI property page” on page 1392.
See:
“ACT presets” on page 1392

ACT presets
After you have carefully configured the ACT MIDI Controller property page to work with your controller/surface, you will likely want to
save the configuration as a preset.

To save a preset
 Type a name in the Presets window, then click the Save (floppy disk) button.
See:
“Assigning controls on your controller/surface to cells in the ACT MIDI property page” on page 1392

Assigning controls on your controller/surface to cells in the ACT MIDI property
page
Each cell or field on the Controllers tab of the ACT MIDI Controller property page lists the Cakewalk or plug-in parameter that is
currently controlled by that cell. However, if your controller/surface does not have a preset, no knobs or sliders on your controller/
surface will be assigned to that cell, or the knobs may be assigned in a pattern that you don’t prefer.
If your controller/surface does not have a preset, or if you want to change the knobs and sliders that control specific cells in the ACT
MIDI Controller property page, use the MIDI Learn function to assign knobs and sliders to cells:

To assign controls on your controller/surface to cells in the ACT MIDI Controller property page
1. Click the cell on the Controllers tab of the ACT MIDI Controller property page that you want to control with a specific knob or
control on your controller/surface. You can assign knobs to cells that do not currently list any Cakewalk or plug-in parameter.
The cell displays the MIDI Learn message.
2. Move the control on your controller/surface that you want to use to control that cell. This assigns the control to the cell.
3. You can edit the cell label by clicking the label and entering a new name in the Edit Label dialog box. This way you can
immediately see which knobs or sliders on your controller/surface are controlling which cell in the ACT MIDI Controller property
page.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all the cells you want to control. Remember, you can assign controls to cells that do not currently list any
Cakewalk or plug-in parameters.
5. When you are finished assigning controls to cells, save your work as a preset: choose a preset or type a new name in the
Presets box, and click the Save button (floppy disk icon) that’s next to the Presets window.

Loading Cakewalk Generic Surface presets
Cakewalk contains preset mappings for most controllers/surfaces. Before creating a set of mappings from scratch, load one of the
preset mappings for your controller/surface and see if you like it. Even if the preset doesn’t meet all of your needs, it is usually a
good base for creating your own presets.
Note: To use ACT with the Cakewalk Generic Surface property page, you need to first assign the knobs and controls on your
controller/surface to radio buttons 1-9 and A-G in the ACT Controls section of the property page, and save these assignments
as a new preset. See “To Use ACT with the Cakewalk Generic Surface” on page 1394.

To load a preset
1. At the top of the Cakewalk Generic Surface property page, in the Presets field, click the drop-down arrow that is at the right edge
of the Presets box to display the menu of built-in presets.
2. Find the name of your controller/surface. There may be several versions of presets for your controller/surface, if your controller/
surface has multiple presets.
3. Click one of the versions. If there are no versions for your controller/surface, see “Assigning faders and knobs to control
Cakewalk parameters” on page 1394.
Try out the available presets for your controller/surface. If you want to edit one of them, first save it under a new name: type a new
name for it in the Presets window, and then click the Save button

that’s next to the Presets box.

Assigning faders and knobs to control Cakewalk parameters
The Cakewalk Generic Surface property page has separate sections that control track parameters (the Track Parameters section),
plug-in parameters (the ACT Controls section), and global parameters (the Global Parameters section).

To configure track parameters
1. In the Cakewalk Generic Surface property page, in the Use ACT or Strip Params fields, make sure that either the ACT Enable
check box is disabled, or that the Both check box is enabled. If the Both check box is enabled, your controller/surface is
controlling both track and plug-in parameters.
2. In the Configure Strip Number field, use the drop-down menu to choose which track strip in the current bank of tracks you want
to configure (the number of tracks in the current bank is listed in the Number of Track Strips field).
3. If you want to change how many tracks are in a single bank, enter a new number in the Number of Track Strips field.
4. Click the radio button of the Parameter that you want to configure (choose from Parameters 1-16).
5. Use the drop-down menu next to the parameter you clicked to choose exactly what parameter you want to configure.
6. Move the control on your controller/surface that you want to use to control this parameter.
7. Click the Learn button in the dialog box. The MIDI message that the control you moved sent out appears in the MIDI Message
for the Current Cakewalk Parameter section.
8. You can edit how Cakewalk interprets this particular message if you want. See “MIDI Message Interpretation” on page 1399 for
more information.
9. Repeat steps 4-8 if you want to configure more parameters for this track strip, or choose a new track strip in the Configure Strip
Number field, and then repeat steps 4-8
When you’ve finished your edits, either type a name for this group of settings in the Presets window and click the Save button
(recommended), or just click the Save button to overwrite the current preset. You can then reload this collection of track settings any
time you want to by choosing the name of the preset that you saved in the Presets window.

To Use ACT with the Cakewalk Generic Surface
1. Make sure you have completed the following preliminary steps:

 Successfully connected your controller/surface to Cakewalk (if necessary, see “Setting up control surfaces” on page 1388).
 Opened the Cakewalk Generic Surface property page (if necessary, see “To open the Cakewalk Generic Surface property
page” on page 1393).
2. In the ACT Controls section of the Cakewalk Generic Surface property page are radio buttons 1-9 and A-G. These buttons
control plug-in parameters in the active effect or synth plug-in. You first need to assign a knob or control on your controller/
surface to each one of these radio buttons. Do this by clicking a radio button, moving a knob or control on your controller/surface,
and then clicking the Learn button in the Cakewalk Generic Surface property page. You can check what MIDI message you’ve
assigned to each button by clicking a button and then reading the value in the MIDI Message for Current Cakewalk Parameter
section. If the None radio button is highlighted after you click an ACT Controls radio button, you have not assigned a control to
that ACT Controls radio button. When you finish, save your assignments as a preset.
3. Next, in the Cakewalk Generic Surface property page, in the Use ACT or Strip Params fields, make sure that either the ACT
Enable check box is enabled, or that the Both check box is enabled. If the Both check box is enabled, your controller/surface is
controlling both track parameters and plug-in parameters.
4. In Cakewalk, put the focus on the plug-in effect or synth -that you want to configure: either click its property page, or click its
name in an FX Rack.
The name of the plug-in appears in the Context field in the Cakewalk Generic Surface property page.
5. Enable the ACT Learn Mode button

in the Control Bar’s ACT module.

6. In the property page of the plug-in that you want to control, click the parameters that you want to control.
7. Move the sliders/knobs on your controller/surface that you want to use to control the parameters with, in the same order that you
clicked the parameters (you can reverse steps 6 and 7).
8. Disable the ACT Learn Mode button in the Control Bar’s ACT module.
9. A dialog box appears, asking if you want to keep your assignments. Click Yes or No.

As soon as you disable the ACT Learn Mode button, any plug-in mappings that you keep are saved globally, and will be the same in
every project for a particular plug-in. Now your controller/surface can control whatever soft synth or effect currently has focus. If you
want to control only a single instance of a plug-in, regardless of which plug-in has focus, enable the Lock Context check box. For
more information about ACT, see “ACT” on page 1403.
You can save Track parameter mappings and knob/radio button mappings in the Presets window that is at the top of the Cakewalk
Generic Surface property page.

Assigning Forward and Rewind buttons
The Forward and Rewind assignments are special cases in the Cakewalk Generic Surface property page. When you click select
either of these parameters, notice that Literally/Toggle field becomes grayed-out, and the On/Off fields become available. This is
because the Forward and Rewind commands both require two different MIDI messages to function: one MIDI message to turn the
operation on, and a different message to turn the operation off. This kind of operation is best assigned to a button that sends out one
MIDI message when you hold or push it down, and a different MIDI message when you let the button up. The property page can
usually fill in the On field and the Off field correctly if you push the desired button a few times and then click the Learn button. But it
helps if you know exactly what MIDI messages the desired button sends out. That way, you can fill in the correct trigger values in the
On and Off fields if the displayed values are incorrect.

Conserving knobs and buttons
There are a few tricks you can use if you’re running out of buttons, or if your controller/surface only has a couple of buttons on each
strip, and you want to control more parameters on each track:

 Assign a two-way knob or button to control two different parameters. If a knob sends out one MIDI message when it’s
turned to the right and a different MIDI message when it’s turned to the left, you could use it to control 2 toggle-type parameters,
such as Solo and Arm. For example, if a knob sends out NRPN # 5000 with a data value of 1 when you turn it to the right and a
data value of 16383 when you turn it to the left, you could use a Trigger Value of 1 to turn the Arm button on and off, and a
Trigger Value of 16383 to turn the Solo button on and off. That way, each time you turn the knob to the right, the Arm button
turns on or off. Each time you turn the knob left, the Solo button turns on or off.

 Assign a two-way knob to control a continuous parameter. If your fader is assigned to control Volume, you can use a twoway knob to control Pan or some other continuous parameter such as Send 1 Level. For example, if a knob sends out NRPN #
5000 with a data value of 1 when you turn it to the right and a data value of 16383 when you turn it to the left, you could use a
value of 1 in the Increment/Decrement Plus + field, and a value of 16383 in the Increment/Decrement Minus - field. That way,
each time you turn the knob to the right, the Pan parameter (or whatever parameter you want) increases by 1. Each time you turn
the knob to the left, the parameter decreases by 1. The parameter continues to increase if you keep turning the knob to the right,
and decreases similarly if you keep turning the knob to the left.

 Use multiple strips to control one track at a time. Assign as many knobs and faders as you want to control lots of parameters
on only one track (leave the Configure Strip Number field set to 1 while you’re assigning faders and knobs). Then assign a
couple of buttons to Move 1 Left and Move 1 Right, so you can shift your controller/surface one track at a time.

Controlling different tracks or groups of tracks
The Cakewalk Generic Surface plug-in can control anywhere from 1-32 tracks simultaneously, as specified by whatever number you
fill in the Number of Track Strips field in the Cakewalk Generic Surface property page. There is always at least one track being
controlled, referred to as the Base Track. The Number of Track Strips value refers to the base track plus ‘n’ number of additional
tracks. The Control Bar’s ACT module automatically updates to display the range of tracks (1-8, 2-9, 9-16, etc.) that your control
surface currently controls.
If multiple controller/surfaces are enabled, the Control Bar’s ACT module lets you select which controller/surface to display track
information for.
The currently controlled tracks are displayed in the ACT module. It is important to understand that the ACT module is for display
purposes only—it gets information from the Cakewalk Generic Surface plug-in (or any other active controller/surface plug-in), but the
ACT module cannot update, or send information to the Cakewalk Generic Surface plug-in. Changing which tracks are controlled
must be done with the Move 1 Left, Move 1 Right, Move Bank Left, or Move Bank Right parameters, or by clicking the BaseTrack
buttons that are at the top of the Cakewalk Generic Surface property page.
Note: If you don’t have any buttons left over to assign to the Move 1 or Move Bank parameters, you can click the right or left
buttons in the BaseTrack section of the Cakewalk Generic Surface property page to move the Base Track to the right or left
by one track. The buttons are located so that you can resize the property page to just show the buttons and the Presets field.

To control the next track or bank of tracks
1. In the Cakewalk Generic Surface property page under Global Parameters, select Move 1 Right to control the next highernumbered track, or Move Bank Right to control the next higher-numbered bank of tracks.
2. Move (twice) the button or knob that you want to use to shift the controller/surface to the next higher-numbered track or bank (for
example, from track 1 to track 2, or from tracks 1-8 to tracks 9-16).
3. Click the Learn button.
The property page reads the type of MIDI message and displays the characteristics in the appropriate fields.
4. Press the TAB key to accept the data.
5. Move the button or knob again and watch the display in the Control Bar’s ACT module to see if the current tracks shift by the
appropriate number.
Repeat this procedure, but use a different knob, and select Move 1 Left or Move Bank Left so that you can move the current track
or bank to a lower-numbered one.

The Cakewalk Generic Surface property page
The Cakewalk Generic Surface property page appears when you click the Open Control Surface Plug-in button
in the ACT
module while Cakewalk Generic Surface appears in the drop-down menu. The Cakewalk Generic Control controller/surface plug-in
must be enabled first, however (see “Setting up control surfaces” on page 1388, if necessary).
The property page contains the following sections:

BaseTrack
This section contains 2 buttons on either side of a number field. You can click the buttons to move the Base Track to a highernumbered track (right button) or lower-numbered track (left button). The Base Track is the first track in the bank of tracks that your
controller/surface is currently controlling. You define how many tracks are in a bank by entering a number in the Number of Track
Strips field. The number can be from 1 to 32, inclusive. The property page is designed so that you can minimize it (by dragging the
border) to show only the BaseTrack buttons and Preset window, so you can click the buttons while you’re working. The buttons are
an alternative way to change the Base Track if you haven’t assigned any buttons on your controller/surface to do that. The Move 1
and Move Bank fields are what you use to assign those functions.

Track Parameters
This section lists the particular track strip you are assigning controls for, the number of strips that make up a bank of tracks, and the
various track parameters you can control with the faders and knobs on your controller/surface. You can assign the following different
track parameters (they are listed in the drop-down menu next to each Parameter “n” field):

 Volume
 Pan
 Mute
 Solo
 Record Arm
 Write Enable
 Phase
 Send “n” Level (“n”=1-16; depending on number of active buses; Send 1 Level=Reverb for MIDI tracks, Send 2 Level=Chorus for
MIDI tracks)

 Send “n” Pan (“n”=1-16)
 Send “n” Enable (“n”=1-16)
 Send “n” Pre/Post (“n”=1-6)
Use ACT or Strip Params
This section lets you decide whether your controller/surface is controlling track parameters, plug-in parameters, or both.
Note: It’s possible to use the same control on your controller/surface to control both a track parameter and a plug-in parameter.
It’s not usually a good idea to control both at the same time.
This section has the following controls:

 ACT Enable radio button. Lets you assign a control on your controller/surface to enable or disable the ACT Enable check box.
Radio buttons are used with Learn mode.

 ACT Enable check box. When this check box is enabled (and not grayed-out), your controller/surface controls plug-in
parameters only.

 Both check box. When this check box is enabled, your controller/surface controls both track and plug-in parameters. When
neither the Both check box nor the ACT Enable check box are enabled, your controller/surface controls track parameters only. In
Both mode, you typically allocate some physical controls to control Track parameters, while other physical controls are allocated
to control plug-in parameters.

ACT Controls
This section let's you assign buttons and knobs to control plug-ins. This section has the following controls:

 Lock Context radio button. Lets you assign a control on your controller/surface to enable or disable the Lock Context check
box.

 Lock Context check box. When this check box is enabled, your controller/surface controls only the particular instance of the
particular plug-in that had focus when you enabled this check box.

 Context field. Displays the name of the plug-in that currently has focus, unless the Lock Context check box is enabled.
 Physical Control Type. This field lets you tell Cakewalk what kind of control you are using for the selected parameter. For
example, if the parameter you’re controlling is an On/Off type of parameter, like a power button, it would be a good idea to use a
button or switch on your controller instead of a slider.

 Radio buttons 1-9 and A-G. Each of these 16 radio buttons lets you map up to 16 plug-in parameters to controls on your
controller/surface. The name of each of the 16 plug-in parameters that are currently being controlled are listed in order next to
each radio button. To use these buttons, you must first assign a control on your controller/surface to each one of these buttons.
See “To Use ACT with the Cakewalk Generic Surface” on page 1394.

MIDI Message for the Current Cakewalk Parameter
This section is where you can choose a specific kind of MIDI message to control whatever parameter is selected in the Track
Parameters, ACT Controls (including the ACT Enable check box), or Global Parameters sections. Most of the time you don’t
need to choose, because the Learn button fills in the fields automatically.
Choose from the following options:

 None. Click this button to disable control of the selected parameter.
 Learn. If you don't know the exact MIDI message that a fader/knob/button transmits, you can simply move the fader/knob/button
a couple of times, and then click Learn to automatically fill in the correct MIDI message.

 Controller. With this button enabled and a Controller number entered in the Number field, Cakewalk moves the selected
parameter whenever it receives this specific controller message from your controller/surface on the specified channel.

 Channel. The MIDI channel the controller/surface uses for the MIDI Message that is controlling the current parameter.
 NRPN. With this button enabled and a NRPN number entered in the Number field, Cakewalk moves the selected parameter
whenever it receives this specific NRPN message from your controller/surface on the specified channel.

 Trigger Value. For triggered actions (mute, solo, play, stop, etc.), specify the Controller, NRPN or RPN value that will trigger the
current parameter.

 RPN. With this button enabled and a RPN number entered in the Number field, Cakewalk moves the selected parameter
whenever it receives this specific RPN message from your controller/surface on the specified channel.

 Note. You can use a Note On message to trigger a parameter or action. The Number field next to the radio button displays the
note number, and the Trigger Value field displays the velocity the note must use to trigger the desired parameter. If you use a
MIDI keyboard for this field, you can enter zero in the Trigger Value field, and the property page will then use the Note Off signal
as a trigger, instead of the Note On.

 Wheel. You can use a pitch wheel to trigger a parameter. In this case, the Trigger Value field uses a range of numbers from 0 to
16383. Continuous parameters such as Pan or Volume are the best choices for a pitch wheel (except for the fact that the wheel
usually returns to its original position when you let go of it), but you can use a wheel to control toggle-type parameters by entering
0 or 16383 in the Trigger Value field. That way, you’ll trigger the desired parameter when the wheel reaches its maximum or
minimum position.

 Sysx Single Byte. Selecting this option tells Cakewalk that the significant data (the variable, or parameter value) in the
incoming Sysx message is in the form of a single byte. The Sysx Single Byte option has the following structure: F0 ? VV ? F7.
The pre string should be F0 ?, where you must include the F0 byte, and the post string should be ? F7, where you must include
the F7 byte.

 Sysx High Byte First. Selecting this option tells Cakewalk that the significant data in the incoming Sysx message is in the form
of two bytes, with the high byte first. The Sysx High Byte First option has the following structure: F0 ? HI LO ? F7.

 Sysx Low Byte First. Selecting this option tells Cakewalk that the significant data in the incoming Sysx message is in the form
of two bytes, with the low byte first. The Sysx Low Byte First option has the following structure: F0 ? LO HI ? F7.

1398

External devices
Cakewalk Generic Surface plug-in

 Starts With. Fill in the string that your controller/surface sends in Sysx messages that precedes the significant data.
 Ends With. Fill in the string that your controller/surface sends in Sysx messages that follows the significant data.
 Sysx Trigger. Triggered targets (play, mute, solo, etc.) are enacted by using a Sysx trigger, where the user simply types the
entire Sysx message F0 ?? F7 that will trigger the action.

 Trigger Message. The exact Sysx message, in the form of F0 ? ? F7, for the Sysx Trigger option.
Note: The Sysx Single Byte, Sysx High Byte First, and Sysx Low Byte First options assume that the Sysx message will be
interpreted as a value to control continuous parameters such as Volume, extracted from somewhere in the middle of the
message. That is why those three options are unavailable for “triggered” targets, like play, record, mute, solo, move 1 left, move
1 right, etc.

MIDI Message Interpretation
A special interpretation of a MIDI message is commonly used in the following two cases:

 Literally/Toggle. The property page interprets almost all MIDI messages as either literal values or toggle-type values, so most
of the time this button is checked. A fader usually sends out a stream of different messages that are different for each position of
the fader. The values of these messages are used “literally” to make timely changes in a continuous parameter such as Volume.
The other common interpretation of a MIDI message is that it is meant to “toggle” a control such as a Mute button on and off. The
property page interprets almost all MIDI messages as one of these two types of message.

 Increment/Decrement. This option is valuable if you want to use a button or knob that can only send two different values to
control a continuous parameter, such as Pan or Volume (see “Conserving knobs and buttons” on page 1395).

 Plus+. The value that causes the desired parameter to increase by 1.
 Minus-. The value that causes the desired parameter to decrease by 1.
 On/Off. This option is currently only used with the Forward >> and Rewind << shuttle actions. You should only assign buttons
to these functions if each button sends a different MIDI message when it is released from the message it sends when it is pushed.
The On field displays the value the button sends when you push it, and the Off field displays the value the button sends when you
release it.

Global Parameters
This section let's you assign buttons and knobs to control Cakewalk’s transport. The parameters you can control are:

 Play
 Stop
 Forward >>
 Rewind <<
 Record
 Write Automation
 Jog <- (previous measure)
 Jog -> (next measure)
 Move 1 Left. This parameter changes the currently-controlled track to the next lower-numbered track.
 Move Bank Left. This parameter changes the currently-controlled bank of tracks to the next lower-numbered bank of tracks.
 Move 1 Right. This parameter changes the currently-controlled track to the next higher-numbered track.
 Move Bank Right. This parameter changes the currently-controlled bank of tracks to the next higher-numbered bank of tracks.
Presets
After you have carefully configured the Cakewalk Generic Surface property page to work with your control surface, you will likely
want to save the configuration as a preset.

To save a preset
 Type a name in the Preset box, then click the Save (floppy disk) button.

ACT
Active Controller Technology (ACT) allows you to control whatever plug-in effect or soft synth currently has focus. The controller/
surface mappings for a particular plug-in work the same on each instance of that plug-in, whenever that instance has focus. You can
change the focus to a particular plug-in by clicking either the plug-in’s interface, or its name in an FX Rack. Any plug-in that has ACT
focus appears highlighted blue in the FX Rack.
Figure 574. Plug-ins with ACT focus are highlighted in the FX Rack.

Cakewalk has built-in mappings for all relatively recent Cakewalk plug-ins, however some older plug-ins such as the TTS-1 do not
support ACT.
Note: If you’re not using a Roland A-PRO controller, using ACT at this date means using either the ACT MIDI Controller Plugin, or the Cakewalk Generic Surface Plug-in. The ACT MIDI Controller Plug-in has presets for most popular controller/surfaces
that include built-in links between the knobs and controls on a given controller/surface and the cells on the Controllers tab of
the ACT MIDI Controller property page. If you’re not using one of the factory presets (or there isn’t one for your controller/
surface) OR if you’re using the Cakewalk Generic Surface Plug-in, you need to establish some links between the knobs and
controls on your controller/surface, and either the cells in the ACT MIDI Controller property page or the radio buttons in the
Cakewalk Generic Surface Plug-in property page. To do either of these, see “Assigning controls on your controller/surface to
cells in the ACT MIDI property page” on page 1392, or “To Use ACT with the Cakewalk Generic Surface” on page 1394.

To use ACT with the ACT MIDI Controller plug-in
1. Make sure you have completed the following preliminary steps:

 Successfully connected your controller/surface to Cakewalk (if necessary, see “Setting up control surfaces” on page 1388)
 Opened the ACT MIDI Controller property page (if necessary, see “To open the ACT MIDI Controller property page” on page
1391)

 Selected a preset from the ACT MIDI Controller property page Presets menu, either a factory preset for your controller/
surface, or a self-created preset (if there is no preset, see “Assigning controls on your controller/surface to cells in the ACT
MIDI property page” on page 1392).
2. Enable ACT in the ACT MIDI Controller property page by enabling the Active Controller Technology Enable check box. The ACT
MIDI Controller can enable this check box from the controller/surface itself.
3. Put the focus on the plug-in that you want to control.
The name of the plug-in appears in the Active Controller Technology field of your controller/surface’s property page, and the
current mappings appear above the Knob and Slider fields in the controller/surface property page.
4. Adjust the plug-in’s parameters by moving the controls on your controller/surface (if you’re using a self-created preset for the first
time, you may have to create your own ACT Mappings before you can do this step—see the following procedure).

5. If you want to control only this instance of the plug-in with your controller/surface, enable the Lock check box in the ACT MIDI
Controller property page, or enable the ACT Lock button

in the Control Bar’s ACT module.

6. If you are not locking the controller/surface to a single instance of a plug-in, put the focus on another plug-in, if desired, and
adjust its parameters.

To edit the default ACT mappings
1. Enable ACT in the ACT MIDI Controller property page by enabling the Active Controller Technology Enable check box.
2. Enable the ACT Learn Mode button

in the Control Bar’s ACT module.

3. Open the property page of the plug-in that you want to control.
4. Click the parameters in the property page that you want to control.
5. Move the sliders/knobs on your controller/surface that you want to use to control the parameters with, in the same order that you
clicked the parameters (you can reverse steps 4 and 5).
6. Disable the ACT Learn Mode button in the Control Bar’s ACT module.
7. A dialog box asks if you want to keep your assignments. Click Yes or No.
Any assignments you keep are saved automatically as soon as you disable the Learn button. These assignments are global, so they
are the same for every project.
8. In the property page of the plug-in that you want to control, click the parameters that you want to control.
9. Move the sliders/knobs on your controller/surface that you want to use to control the parameters with, in the same order that you
clicked the parameters (you can reverse steps 6 and 7).

Importing ACT data
You can use ACT with any automatable plug-in. You can create your own mappings by using the ACT Learn button, but because
ACT Learn mappings are stored in XML files, you can also import XML data that contains predefined parameter mappings for certain
plug-ins. These predefined parameter mappings provide generic “best guess” assignments between the controls on your surface,
and the parameters in the plug-in, which gives you a starting point that you can customize by using the ACT Learn process.
The import feature makes it easy for users to share data, and will also allow you to download incremental updates when new plug-in
mappings become available.
If you import ACT data for a certain plug-in, and you have already mapped some of the parameters in that plug-in, for each alreadymapped plug-in, a dialog box asks you if you want to overwrite that plug-in's mapping. This lets you protect any parameter mappings
that you've already done.
To see if any new ACT XML files are currently available, check the support pages at www.cakewalk.com.

To import ACT data
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Control Surfaces.
2. Click the Import ACT Data button to open the Import dialog box.
3. Navigate to an XML file that contains ACT Learn data, select the file, and click Open.
If duplicate plug-in entries are encountered during import, Cakewalk will ask if you want to overwrite the existing plug-in settings. The
options are: Yes, Yes All, No, No All. Select one of the answers.
Cakewalk imports the ACT data you requested.

Working with StudioWare
StudioWare panels are software interfaces to external MIDI devices such as samplers, keyboards, automatable mixers, and effects
units. These interfaces allow you to manipulate the controls on any external MIDI device from graphical controls on your screen. The
changes you make to these controls can even be recorded and then played back as part of your project.
Cakewalk includes a wide variety of StudioWare panels for popular MIDI devices, with new panels constantly under development
here at Cakewalk, by equipment manufacturers, and by Cakewalk users. Check the Cakewalk website (www.cakewalk.com) from
time to time for new and updated StudioWare panels.

Every StudioWare panel is made up of a collection of controls and other information displays. The controls are software
representations of the knobs, buttons, and sliders on an external MIDI device. By moving the controls on the screen, you adjust the
controls on the external MIDI device. If you want, you can also configure the StudioWare panel so that moving the controls on the
external device adjusts the controls on your computer screen. Some StudioWare panels contain controls that perform other functions
within Cakewalk, such as changing track parameters or running CAL programs.
Because StudioWare panels can be used to control many different types of devices, and because each and every panel can be
tailored for a specific application and hardware environment, it is impossible to explain here all the different ways to use a particular
panel. Instead, this section tells you how to use the different types of controls and how to record the changes you make to each
control as part of your project.
There are three types of controls in most StudioWare panels: buttons, knobs, and sliders. In addition, panels may contain LED
indicators, level meters, text, and bitmap images. The appearance of controls and other displays may vary greatly from panel to
panel. They may be of very different sizes, and they may be designed with custom styles, bitmaps, and colors. In addition, sliders
and meters may be laid out either horizontally or vertically.

There are a variety of ways to adjust the values of buttons, sliders, and knobs:

To change this

Do this

The status of a button

Click on the button

The value of a slider

Click on the desired slider position to move the slider to that position, or drag the slider to the desired
position

The value of a knob

Click along the outer edge of the knob to move the knob to that position, or drag the outer edge of the knob
in a circular motion to set the desired position

To change the value of a knob or slider using the keyboard, you must first select the control:

 To select a control that has a numeric value display or label, click on the value or the label.
 To select a control without a numeric value display, click on the control, being careful to click at the current control position. If you
do not click at the current control position, the control will change values as a result of the mouse click.
To adjust a knob or slider using the keyboard:

 Press the - and + keys to decrease or increase the value of the selected control by the smallest amount
 Press the [ and ] keys to decrease or increase the value of the selected control by steps of 10

Grouping controls
Cakewalk lets you create groups of StudioWare controls. When several controls are in a single group, you can move a single control
and have the remaining controls in the group adjust automatically. This is useful for many different mixing and crossfade
applications.
When you create a group of controls, each control in the group has a starting and an ending value. Here’s how these values are
used:

 When you move any control in the group to its starting value, all controls in the group are set to their starting value
 When you move any control in the group to its ending value, all controls in the group are set to their ending value
 When you position any control in the group somewhere between its starting and ending value, all controls in the group are set to
the same relative position between their starting and ending value
The initial range for each control is set based on the position of the controls at the time you group them.
You can adjust the range for any individual control, even if it is part of a group, simply by holding the SHIFT key while you move the
control. When you adjust an individual control by holding the SHIFT key, its maximum or minimum is adjusted, depending on
whether the entire group is closer to its minimum or maximum value.

To create a group of controls
1. Select any control by clicking on it with the mouse.
2. Hold down the CTRL key and click on one or more additional controls.
Cakewalk creates a group from the selected controls.

To remove controls from a group
Hold down the CTRL key and click on any control in the group.
Cakewalk removes the control from the group.

To adjust a single control in a group
Hold down the SHIFT key and drag the control to a new value.
The range for the control is adjusted so that its current position corresponds with the current position of other controls in the group.

Example: to set two faders for a crossfade
1. Move the two faders to their midpoint.
2. Click on the first fader, and then CTRL-click on the second to create a group.
3. Move both faders to their highest position.
4. SHIFT-drag the second fader to its lowest position.
5. Drag the first fader to its lowest position.
6. SHIFT-drag the second fader to its highest position.
These two controls are now grouped so that they move in opposite directions.
The minimum and maximum values of the faders look like this:

Fader

Starting value

Ending value

#1

0

127

#2

127

0

1408

External devices

To set faders that are always the same distance apart, set the ranges something like this:

Fader

Starting value

Ending value

#1

0

63

#2

64

127

To set faders to move over different ranges of values, set them something like this:

Fader

Starting value

Ending value

#1

0

127

#2

0

Recording control movements
You can move the controls in a StudioWare panel while playing back a project to adjust the levels or other MIDI activity that the panel
is designed to accommodate. In addition, you can record changes that you make to the controls in a panel so that these changes
become a part of your project. Recording changes so that they play back automatically is known as automation.
There are two general approaches to recording control movements, as indicated in the following table.

Approach

How it works

Snapshot

You set all the controls to the values you want, and then create a snapshot of these settings at a particular Now
time. When you play back the project later, all the controls will snap back to these settings when you reach the
appropriate Now time.

Real-time recording

You move controls in any way you like, recording the series of changes you make so they become part of your
project. When you play back the project later, the controls move exactly as you recorded them.

The first approach is useful, for example, when your project contains a variety of distinct sections and you want to make a sudden
change in one or more settings between the sections.
The latter approach is most useful when you want to create smooth transitions from one section to another. For example, you could
slowly add modulation to a MIDI piano or move the faders on a digital mixing console. Once you record these changes, they will play
back along with your project automatically.
StudioWare lets you record and re-record automation data as many times as necessary. When you record new movements for a
control, any old events for that control are replaced by the newer ones. Movements of other controls are unaffected. You can rerecord moves again and again until you’ve got the movement exactly the way you want it. You can also edit automation data using
the Notes pane in the Piano Roll view.
There are three tools in the StudioWare toolbar that are used to control recording and automation:

Icon

Tool

What it’s for

Update

Makes the controls in the panel update automatically during playback or when MIDI data is received by the
panel

Snapshot

Records a snapshot of the current position of all controls

Record

Activates real-time recording of all control movements

External devices
Working with StudioWare

1409

Most StudioWare panels are designed to both send and receive MIDI data. This means two things:

 If you move the controls on your external MIDI device, the StudioWare panel will be notified of the changes
 When you play back a project containing automation data, the StudioWare panel is notified of the automation changes
The Update button in the StudioWare toolbar indicates whether these changes are played back visually on the StudioWare panel.
Press this button to make sure that automation parameters and changes made on the external MIDI device are displayed in the
StudioWare panel. Turn this option off if you do not want to see these changes.
If you are recording a snapshot while playback is in progress, you should probably disable Update. Otherwise, some of the controls
may move as a result of previously recorded automation events, even while you are trying to position them correctly.
When you are recording real-time control movements, you probably want Update enabled, so that the controls will show the events
that have already been recorded.
If you record automation data on a track that contains linked clips, Cakewalk automatically unlinks the clips so that the automation
data do not apply to other instances of the linked clip. As an example, suppose you have four repetitions of a particular riff, stored in
four linked clips that play in sequence. When you record a fade-out over these four clips, Cakewalk automatically splits the clips into
four independent clips, each with automation data representing some portion of the fade.
If you record a snapshot of control positions on a track that contains linked clips, the clips remain linked, and the snapshot applies to
all copies of the linked clip.
If you are not happy with the automation data you recorded, you can always use the Edit > Undo command to remove it.
The automation data you record using a StudioWare panel can be displayed and edited using either the Notes pane in the Piano Roll
view or the Event List view. For more information about the Controller pane, see “Controllers, RPNs, NRPNs, and automation data”
on page 885. For more information about the Event List view, see “The Event List view” on page 887.

To record a snapshot while playback is stopped
1. Set the Now time to the point in the project where you want the settings to take effect.
2. Move the controls to the settings you desire.
3. Click

.

Cakewalk records a snapshot of the current control settings.
If the Now time is the very beginning of the project, then the snapshot will change the track parameters to match the controls in the
panel instead of recording automation events.

To record a snapshot while playback is in progress
1. Make sure the

button in the StudioWare toolbar is not pressed so that Update is disabled.

2. Change the Now time to a few bars or seconds before the time you want to take the snapshot.
3. Start playback.
4. When you have reached the appropriate time, click on the Snapshot button.
Cakewalk records a snapshot of the current control settings.

Cakewalk records the control changes that you entered while playback was in progress.

Control settings
The controls in a StudioWare panel are designed to send and receive various types of MIDI information. This information can be
transmitted to two possible destinations:

 A specific track in your project
 A MIDI output
When you want to record the movements of controls within a panel, you must make sure that MIDI data from the control are directed
to a MIDI track.

StudioWare Panel drawing speed
Some StudioWare panels use bitmap graphics to enhance their appearance. These graphics can slow down the speed with which a
panel is displayed on some slower PCs. You can turn off these bitmap graphics by adding this line to the [WinCake] section of the
Cakewalk.ini file, as follows.
PanelsShowWidgetBitmaps=0
To turn bitmap graphics on again, change the entry to:
PanelsShowWidgetBitmaps=1
For more information about the Cakewalk.ini file, see “Initialization files” on page 1459.

Microsoft Surface Dial support
Figure 575. Surface Dial.

Note: Surface Dial communicates via Bluetooth LE, and requires Windows 10 Creators Update or later.

Cakewalk has integrated support for Windows wheel input devices such as Microsoft’s Surface Dial, which is a hardware device that
provides tactile control of various actions like controlling the transport, adjusting knobs and controls, and zooming. It provides a great
workflow when used in conjunction with a mouse, pen, or multi-touch.

Using the dial
Surface Dial is an accessory that is intended to be operated by your non-dominant hand as a secondary input device, while using
your dominant hand for primary mouse, pen, or touch input. Using both hands simultaneously allows for a more natural experience.
After pairing Surface Dial with your computer, there are no additional setup steps required in Cakewalk.
The Dial supports three simple gestures:

 Press and hold. Press the dial down and hold. This gesture opens a radial menu that lets you select a mode to use when
rotating the dial (see “To select a mode” on page 1413).

 Rotate. Turn the dial left or right. The function is determined by the current mode. Cakewalk supports acceleration when rotating
the Dial, and responds faster or slower depending on how fast you rotate the Dial.

 Click. Press the dial and release, similar to a mouse click. This gesture starts and stops the transport.
Surface Dial vibrates in order to provide haptic feedback when rotating the dial. Haptic feedback can be disabled under Windows
Settings > Devices > Wheel.

Enhanced pen support in the Piano Roll view
You can use a pen instead of a mouse in many areas of Cakewalk. The Piano Roll view also offers enhanced support for a pen’s
eraser functionality and pressure-sensitive tip when drawing Note events and continuous controller data.
Pen input is intuitive and feels natural, and expands on the versatility of multi-touch when you want even greater precision. If you are
already using a control surface or touch screen along with keyboard shortcuts, adding a pen to your workflow will be easy to adopt
and can greatly improve your efficiency.
Cakewalk fully support a pen’s right-click button, eraser functionality, and pressure-sensitive tip.

A pen typically supports any combination of the following controls:

 Eraser (Top). To erase, flip the pen over and use the top as an eraser. See “To delete events with a pen” on page 1416.
 Right-click button. This button acts like the right-click button on a mouse. Hold the button down as you tap the screen. See “To
open context menus with a pen” on page 1416.

 Eraser button. Hold down the Eraser button and move the tip over the area you want to erase. See “To delete events with a
pen” on page 1416.

 Tip. The tip acts like clicking with a mouse. Move the tip over the area you want select, then tap the screen. Many pens also
support different amounts of pressure when applying force to the screen. Cakewalk responds to pressure by adjusting velocity or
controller data when drawing Note events. See “To draw events with a pen” on page 1416.

Note: Keyboard shortcuts work in conjunction with a pen just like they do with a mouse.

1415

To draw events with a pen
To draw, simply tap the screen and move the pen.
Many pens support different amounts of pressure when applying force to the screen. Cakewalk responds to pressure by adjusting
velocity or controller data when drawing Note events.

 If the Controller pane is closed, or the Velocity lane is selected. Pen pressure adjusts the velocity of the Note event being
drawn.

 If a continuous controller lane is selected. New controller data is created for the duration of the drawn Note event. Pen
pressure determines the controller value.

Tip: You can use a pen to tap piano keys in the Piano Roll view to audition pitches. Use pressure to adjust velocity.

To delete events with a pen
Most pens have either a dedicated Eraser side button that is used in combination with the tip, or the Top button functions as an
eraser when the pen is flipped over.

 Eraser (Top). To delete events, flip the pen over and use the top as an eraser. Only events that are touched will be deleted.
 Eraser button + Tip. Hold down the Eraser button and move the tip over the events you want to delete.
This special “touch” eraser mode is always available, regardless of which global tool is selected.
Because the pen tip acts like clicking with a mouse, you can also use all other delete gestures that are supported by the Smart tool
, Freehand tool
, and Erase tool
. For details, see “Using the Smart tool on PRV notes” on page 581, “Using the Freehand
tool on PRV notes” on page 602, and “Using the Erase tool on PRV notes” on page 614.

To select events with a pen
The pen tip acts like clicking with a mouse. To make a selection, move the tip over the area you want select, then tap the screen.

To open context menus with a pen
To open a context menu, hold the pen’s Right-click button down and tap the screen where you want to open the context menu.

Using CAL

Cakewalk Application Language (CAL) is an event-processing language that you use to extend Cakewalk with custom editing
commands.
See:
“Running CAL programs” on page 1417
“Sample CAL files” on page 1417

Running CAL programs
To interrupt a CAL program while it is running, press the ESC (Escape) key. Press OK to confirm that you want to interrupt the CAL
program. As a rule, you shouldn’t interrupt a CAL program in this way unless you suspect it is stuck in an infinite loop.

To open a CAL program
1. Select the MIDI data you want to edit.
2. Choose Process > Run CAL.
The Open dialog box appears.
3. Navigate to the folder that contains the CAL program you want to run.
4. Choose the file you want to open and click Open.
The CAL program you chose runs and modifies the selected MIDI data.

Sample CAL files
The following is a description of the sample CAL programs that come with Cakewalk. You can use these programs as is or modify
them to suit your own needs.
See:
“SPLIT NOTE TO TRACKS.cal” on page 1417
“SPLIT CHANNEL TO TRACKS.cal” on page 1418
“RANDOM TIME.cal” on page 1418
“THIN CONTROLLER DATA.cal” on page 1418
“THIN CHANNEL AFTERTOUCH.cal” on page 1418
“THIN PITCH WHEEL.cal” on page 1418
“MAJOR CHORD.cal, MINOR CHORD.cal” on page 1418

SPLIT NOTE TO TRACKS.cal
This program splits individual notes to separate tracks. It is useful if you have one drum track but want to split each drum to a
separate track (for more flexible editing).

Using CAL
Running CAL programs

1417

SPLIT CHANNEL TO TRACKS.cal
This program splits a track by channel into 16 new tracks. This can be useful for Type 0 MIDI files, which may have data recorded on
many channels but only one track.

To use the program
1. Select only one track.
2. Set the From and Thru markers for any part of the track (you don’t have to split the whole track).
3. Run the Split Channel to Tracks.cal program.
Cakewalk displays a dialog box.
4. Select the first track for the 16 split-channel tracks (preferably, the first of 16 blank tracks).
5. Click OK.

RANDOM TIME.cal
This program randomizes event starting times. It asks you for a number of ticks. The program then changes each event time by an
amount that is randomly between plus or minus one-half the number of ticks that you supply.
For example, if you type the number 4, each event time will have -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2 added to it.

THIN CONTROLLER DATA.cal
This thins continuous Controller data. It prompts you for two numbers.

 The number of the Controller that you want to thin. For example, MIDI assigns the Volume controller to number 7.
 A thinning factor. For example, if you specify the number 3, the program deletes every third Controller event of the kind you’ve
specified.
This program never deletes Controllers with the values 0, 64, or 127, because the goal is to thin the data without destroying the
fundamental shape of it.

THIN CHANNEL AFTERTOUCH.cal
This works almost exactly like the previous program, but it thins channel aftertouch (ChanAft) events. It asks you for the thinning
factor.

THIN PITCH WHEEL.cal
This works almost exactly like the previous two programs, but it thins pitch-wheel events. It asks you for the thinning factor.
This program never deletes wheel events with these special values:
-8192, 0, and 8191.

MAJOR CHORD.cal, MINOR CHORD.cal
These two CAL programs and the three other chord-building CAL programs that come with Cakewalk build chords using existing
events in the track(s) as chord roots.
For instance, if you select a single note as the region and run Major_chord.cal, two notes are added above the original note. The
resulting chord is a major triad.
Normally, you’ll use these programs on a region containing a single note. You can, however, apply these to tracks containing many
notes. Each original note will become the root of a chord.

More “Frequently asked questions” on page 1419.

Cakewalk doesn't recognize new plug-ins; missing plug-ins message
Cakewalk supports both VST and DirectX effect and instrument plug-ins. You will first need to determine which of these two types of
plug-ins you have. Most third-party plug-ins are VST.

For VST Plug-ins
When you install a new VST plug-in, be mindful of the folder where it is installed as often times this location is set by the plug-in
manufacturer upon installation. Common default locations include:
C:\Program Files\Cakewalk\VstPlugins (recommended location)
C:\Program Files\Steinberg\VstPlugins
C:\Program Files\VstPlugins
VST plug-ins appear in Cakewalk via the integrated VST scanner. If you have installed VST plug-ins to a common location, like the
folders listed earlier, you may not need to take any additional steps. If the new plug still does not appear, you will need to point
Cakewalk's VST scanner to the exact directory where your new VST plug-in is installed.
To do so:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings.
2. Under VST Scan Folder(s), click the Add button and browse to the folder where the new plug-in is installed.
Note: VST scanner looks for dll files. So for example, the file CakewalkSoundCenter.dll is found under C:\Program
Files\Cakewalk\VstPlugins. You will probably notice that this directory has already been added by default and thus
Cakewalk Sound Center appears automatically.
If you do not know where your new VST Plug-ins are located, use the Windows search function to search for the plug-in name. You
are looking for where the “.dll” file is installed. For example, if you are searching for “Beatscape” and find out that Beatscape.dll
is installed to C:\Program Files (x86)\Cakewalk\Vstplugins, then this is the path you must add.

Frequently asked questions
Installation FAQs

1421

3. When you have selected the folder that contains your new plug-in's dll file, click OK.
4. Under Scan Options, select Re-scan Existing Plug-ins and Re-scan Failed Plug-ins, then click Scan.
5. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.
Your new VST plug-in should now appear in Cakewalk’s plug-in menus.

For DirectX Plug-ins
Normally, no additional setup is required for DirectX plug-ins. DirectX plug-ins install globally into Windows and are seen by any
DirectX host program, such as Cakewalk. If your new DirectX plug-in is not appearing in Cakewalk, first check to make sure it is
installed properly. If you are confident it is installed properly, then the plug-in may be excluded from your plug-in lists. To check:
1. Go to Utilities > Cakewalk Plug-in Manager to open Cakewalk Plug-in Manager.
2. Click Show Excluded in the lower left corner.
3. In the Plug-in Categories list, select DirectX Audio Effects (DX) (for audio effects) or DirectX Instruments (DXi) (for soft
synths).
4. Verify if the plug-in appears in the Registered Plug-ins list. If so, the plug-in is excluded.
5. To enable any excluded plug-in, select the plug-in in the Registered Plug-ins list, then click Enable Plug-in.

I can’t locate a recently-installed ProChannel module
ProChannel modularity allows you to insert new ProChannel modules by right-clicking in ProChannel's empty space and selecting
Insert Module on the pop-up menu.
If you have installed a new ProChannel module and do not see it listed, it may be because Cakewalk needs to re-scan your installed
VST plug-ins. If you have disabled automatic VST scanning, Cakewalk will not have scanned automatically and you must manually
re-scan.
To force Cakewalk to re-scan your installed VST-Plug-ins:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings.
2. Under Scan Options, select Automatic Background Scan or Scan on Startup.
3. Click Scan.
After the scan is complete, your new ProChannel module will be available.

Full VST Rescan recommended after upgrading Cakewalk
Cakewalk supports VST3 and various VST enhancements, plus background scanning that automatically detects new plug-ins.
If you are upgrading from an older version of Cakewalk, you should perform a full re-scan of your VST plug-ins in order to take
advantage of some of the new VST enhancements. This is recommended since upgrading from an older version of Cakewalk to a
newer version does not forcefully reset all of your VST plug-in settings.
Note: The reason Cakewalk does not forcefully run this process for upgrade installations is because performing this process will
remove custom configuration settings applied to plug-ins. For example, if you configure an audio effect as a synth, this setting
will be erased and you will need to reapply the setting. Please keep this in mind when performing the below steps.
To perform a full VST Rescan:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - VST Settings.
2. Under Scan Options, select Re-scan Existing Plug-ins and Re-scan Failed Plug-ins, then click Reset.
3. The following confirmation message appears: “This will reset configuration settings for all your VST plug-ins to defaults.
VST Plug-ins will be unavailable until a VST Scan is performed. Any custom configuration settings will be lost. Are you
sure you want to do this?”
4. Click Yes.
5. Click Scan.
The background VST scanner scans your list of plug-ins. When scanning is complete, you can reapply any custom settings to
your plug-ins.
Note: After performing a full VST rescan, clear the Rescan Failed Plug-Ins and Rescan Existing Plug-Ins check boxes,
especially if Automatic Background Scan is selected. Leaving all of these options configured simultaneously can lead to a
continuous scan loop.
For more information about VST Scan settings, see “File - VST Settings” on page 1689.

Switching between Media Foundation and DirectShow video engines
Cakewalk’s video engine defaults to using Microsoft’s Media Foundation framework, rather than DirectShow. This fundamentally
improves the way video files are loaded, played, edited and exported in Cakewalk. Media Foundation generally supports most older
formats supported by DirectShow as well as many newer formats such as H264 video. A full list of media formats supported by
Media Foundation can be found at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd757927(v=vs.85).aspx.
When importing a video file, Cakewalk will first attempt to use the default Media Foundation video engine. If the video format is not
supported, Cakewalk will next attempt to use the legacy DirectShow video engine.
If you experience compatibility issues with video files that worked well with previous versions of Cakewalk, you can globally revert to
the DirectShow video engine.
To specify the default video engine:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Configuration File.
2. Under Configuration Settings, click Edit Config File.
The Aud.ini file opens in the default Windows text editor.
3. In Aud.ini, create a new [Video] section and add a new entry called VideoEngine and set its value to 0. For example:
[Video]
VideoEngine=0
Valid values are as follows:

 0 = DirectShow engine.
 1 = Media Foundation engine (default).
4. Save Aud.ini and close the Windows text editor.
5. Click Reload Config Settings to reload the current audio configuration settings from Aud.ini.
Cakewalk will now use the DirectShow video engine when loading project’s that contain video. Removing the above lines, or setting
VideoEngine=1, will allow Cakewalk to globally use the new Media Foundation engine.

Tip: To confirm which video engine is currently used, right-click the Video view or video thumbnail and select Video Properties on
the pop-up menu, then click the Info tab.

Why do I get an Audio Driver Error?
First, determine what kind of sound card you have. You will find its name and manufacturer listed under Edit > Preferences > Audio
- Devices. Once you have this info, go to Audio Hardware Guide and follow the instructions for your sound card manufacturer.
You may also get this error message when setting the Driver Bit Depth or Sampling Rate beyond the capabilities of the currently
selected sound card.
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings and reduce the Driver Bit Depth to 16 and the Sampling Rate to 44.1.
This is CD-quality and is the best option for most users. Please keep in mind that while many consumer cards such as the
Creative Labs Audigy advertise 24-bit capabilities, their drivers only support 16-bit recording/playback.
2. If your sound card's clock can be controlled via an external connection (Word Clock, ADAT, etc.) or via a control panel, please
make sure that the device's current sampling rate matches the settings in Cakewalk.
3. Your card may also be in use by another computer program. To eliminate this problem, please close all applications running in
the background such as Real Player, Winamp, etc., and turn off all Windows Sounds from the Control Panel. You might also
need to restart Cakewalk.

When switching audio devices I get a “Missing Audio Outputs” error
You may run into this message if you initially saved a project with a specific audio device that is no longer available when you load
the project.
This message is more of a warning than an actual error. The Missing Audio Outputs dialog box lets you easily reroute the missing
track outputs to another available audio device.
For more information about this message, see “Changing I/O devices” on page 250.
More “Frequently asked questions” on page 1419.

I get an error message when changing a project to 24-bit audio
Some audio devices, especially USB devices that use WDM drivers, can not operate in 24-bit mode unless a variable in Cakewalk’s
Aud.ini file is set to 1. The variable is Use24BitExtensible=<0 or 1>, which goes in the [name of your audio device (‘n’
in, ‘n’ out)] section.
To access the Aud.ini file from within Cakewalk, go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Configuration File and click Edit Config
File. After you update and save the Aud.ini file, click Reload Config Settings.

Audio and MIDI FAQs

I can’t hear MIDI playback
Symptom: When you attempt to play back a project (.cwp) or a MIDI file (.mid), the playback meters move and the timeline scrolls,
but there is no sound from the speakers or headphones.
Solution: In order to hear MIDI playback, you need to route the MIDI tracks to a software synth (Insert > Soft Synths), a hardware
synthesizer, or the Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth.

Software synth (DXi, VSTi) setup
If your sound card or audio interface supports WDM or ASIO drivers, you should use a DXi or VSTi virtual instrument as your synth,
rather than the Microsoft GS Wavetable synth, which will not be available in these driver modes.
1. Go to Insert > Soft Synth > DirectX > Cakewalk TTS-1 (or any other available soft synth).
The Insert Soft Synth Options dialog box appears.
2. Select the following options:

 Simple Instrument track
 MIDI Source
 First Synth Audio Output
 Synth Property Page
 Synth Rack View
 Recall Assignable Controls
 Ask This Every Time
3. Click OK.
Cakewalk TTS-1 is added to your project. When a synth has focus, press F1 for online Help about the synth.
4. Open the Track Inspector (View > Inspector, or press I), click the Output control in the IN / OUT section at the bottom, and select
Cakewalk TTS-1. Repeat this step for all MIDI tracks.
Tip: You can quickly assign all tracks to the same output by using a Quick Group (see “Quick Groups” on page 1044). To do so, press
CTRL+A to select all tracks, then hold down the CTRL key while you assign any track to a specific output. All tracks of the same type
(MIDI or audio) will be assigned to the same output.
For more information about using soft synths, see “Software instruments” on page 945.

Internal sound card playback
If your computer has an internal sound card, you can configure Cakewalk to play MIDI through the Microsoft GS Wavetable synth
that is integrated into Windows.
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording
2. Change Driver Mode to WASAPI Exclusive and click Apply
3. Restart Cakewalk and let the Wave Profiler Test your hardware.
4. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices.
5. Under Outputs, select Microsoft GS Wavetable S/W synth, the click OK.

External MIDI synth setup
1. Make sure your MIDI synth or module is connected to your computer (usually via USB or via MIDI cables to an external audio
device). Connect the MIDI Out port on your interface to the MIDI in port on your external MIDI synth, and connect the MIDI In port
on your interface to the MIDI Out port on your external MIDI synth. If you have a USB capable synth, make sure the USB cable is
plugged into its own USB port rather than a USB hub.
2. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Devices and select your MIDI interface in the MIDI In and MIDI Out lists, then click Move
selected devices to top.
3. Make sure you have speakers or headphones connected to your external MIDI synth because now it will play back the MIDI
performance rather than your computer’s audio interface. It's best to connect the audio output of your keyboard/synth to the Line
in jack (or input channel) on your audio interface. This will allow you to record the MIDI as audio later.
4. Your external MIDI synth must be in its multi-timbral mode, and Local Control must be disabled. Local Control is a keyboard
specific setting and is often found in the settings or options menu within your keyboard or synth.
If you are using a synth module or hardware synth (not a MIDI controller), you may want to use an instrument definition in order to
see banks and patches by name in Cakewalk.
Do the following to import instrument definitions into Cakewalk:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > MIDI - Instruments.
2. Click Define to display the Define Instruments and Names dialog box.
3. Click Import to display the Import Instrument Definitions dialog box.
4. Choose the .ins file that contains instrument definitions for your manufacturer, and click Open. Cakewalk displays a list of all
the instrument definitions in the file.
5. Choose one or more instruments from the list, and click OK.
6. Click Close to close the Define Instruments and Names dialog box.
The instrument definitions you imported should now appear in the Uses Instrument list in the Assign Instruments dialog box.
Note: You may need to route channel 10 specifically to a Drum Instrument definition file. If none is available, route all channels
to the single definition.
7. Set the Channel, Bank and Patch of each MIDI track you are routing to the synth. Every MIDI track with a different sound or
patch has to be on a different channel.
More “Frequently asked questions” on page 1419.

No sound from my software instrument/synth
Symptom: I have inserted a soft synth, but when I play notes on my MIDI keyboard I don't hear anything.
Solutions:

 Make sure the Instrument track, MIDI track, or audio track is not muted.
 Make sure the MIDI notes are in the right range for the synth's patch.
 Make sure your MIDI/Instrument Track has its input assigned to the correct MIDI port.
 Make sure Cakewalk’s audio engine is engaged. The Audio Engine button in the Control Bar (Transport module) is lit when the
audio engine is engaged.

 Unless you are using a dedicated Instrument track for the soft synth, make sure the current MIDI track’s Output control is
assigned to the soft synth.

 Make sure the Input Echo button on the current MIDI track is set to Input Echo: Auto Thru or Input Echo: On.
 If your MIDI controller contains an onboard sound module, make sure its Local Control function is set to OFF.

Frequently asked questions
Audio and MIDI FAQs

I'm getting a delay or latency when recording or performing synths
Before you can get MIDI input or input monitoring to work without a delay, you will need to make some adjustments to Cakewalk’s
audio settings:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings.
2. Adjust the Buffer Size slider toward Fast.
If you are using ASIO drivers, the Buffer Size slider will be disabled. If this is the case, you will need to adjust your buffer size/
latency setting by going to your sound card's proprietary control panel. Click on the ASIO Panel button. This opens your sound
card's proprietary control panel. If the ASIO Panel button does not launch your device's control panel, try to open it from the
Windows Control Panel or from the Windows Task Bar.
Ultimately, the smaller the buffer size, the less amount of latency you will hear. If you can get the buffer size down to 10 milliseconds
or less, you will likely not notice a delay. If you experience distortion or audio dropouts, increase your buffer size setting for stability.
Below are some additional suggestions for improving latency performance.

If you are using WDM drivers
1. Make sure you have the latest drivers from your sound card manufacturer's website, and not from the disc included with your
hardware. Manufacturers are constantly updating drivers and there may already be more recent and more stable drivers
available.
2. Cakewalk will try to access the WDM driver mode by default, but many times, built-in sound cards will have trouble in this driver
mode. With built-in sound cards that come with computers, it is often recommended to use the WASAPI Exclusive driver.
3. If you are forced to switch to the MME (32bit) Driver Mode under Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording, then
you may not be able to achieve ultra-low latency. If this is the case, please visit www.cakewalk.com/Support/Knowledge-Base/
2007013101/Open-Audio-Hardware-Guide for additional information.

Regarding DMA Buffer Size
Most high-end cards allow you to change the DMA Buffer Size setting in their proprietary control panel or mixing software.
After you lower the buffer size, you must click the Wave Profiler button under Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings for the
changes to take effect.
Note: The Wave Profiler button is not available when using ASIO drivers.

If you are using ASIO drivers
1. If your device has ASIO drivers, go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording and change Driver Mode to
ASIO.
2. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings and click on the ASIO Panel button. This opens your sound card's
proprietary control panel. If the ASIO Panel button does not launch your device's control panel, try to open it from the Windows
Control Panel or from the Windows Task Bar.
3. Lower the buffer size setting to improve latency.

If you are using your computer’s internal sound card
Internal sound cards are typically designed for general media playback and not necessarily optimized for recording, so your internal
sound card may not be able to perform at low latency settings.
A list of recommended audio cards and additional information is available at the following links:

Audio dropouts or crashes during playback
Symptom: After several seconds of playback, the audio begins to cut out, although the transport appears to keep rolling.
Solutions:

 Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings and increase the value of the Buffer Size slider, or adjust the hardware
buffer size in the ASIO Panel.

 Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Sync and Caching and increase the Playback I/O Buffer Size (KB) and Record I/O Buffer
Size (KB) values. Try settings of 512, 1024, or 2048 KB.

 The current project might have reached the maximum number of tracks and effects the CPU can efficiently handle. For details,
see “Patching an effect into Cakewalk causes a dropout” on page 1434.

 There may be a plug-in that is causing the project to crash. Try opening the project in Safe Mode:
1. Go to File > Open and select the project that crashes, but do not open it yet.
2. Hold down the SHIFT key and click Open.
The File Open - Safe Mode dialog box appears, prompting you to load the plug-ins that are used in the project.
3. Click No for any plug-in that has been recently installed or added to the project. You can also remove any non-Cakewalk
plug-ins to ensure the project will load properly.

“Dropouts and other audio problems” on page 1373
More “Frequently asked questions” on page 1419.

Dropouts happen at high bit-depths or high sample rates
If you are hearing consistent dropouts/clicks in your audio and if your project contains high bit depth (32/64 bit) or high sample rate
audio (88.2K or higher), it may be indicative of a too small I/O buffer size. If so, try doubling the I/O buffer size to 512. If audio
problems persist, reset to 256 and try a different remedy.
Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Sync and Caching, and set Playback I/O Buffer Size (KB) and Record I/O Buffer Size (KB)
to 256, 512 or 1024.
See also:
“Dropouts and other audio problems” on page 1373
More “Frequently asked questions” on page 1419.

Audio dropouts, clicks and pops when playing and recording
The term Dropout is sometimes used interchangeably to describe a few different behaviors. Technically, a dropout is when samples
are dropped during playback and/or recording, resulting in the transport stopping. Sometimes the term Dropout is mistakenly used to
describe events not sounding audibly despite the transport passing over them, or it is used to describe an audible stutter, click or pop
during playback.
There are many very in-depth procedures for tracking down what might be causing performance-related dropouts and audible
artifacts. The most common causes of these behaviors are listed below.
Before proceeding, make sure Cakewalk is correctly configured for use with your sound card or audio interface. Please visit
www.cakewalk.com/Support/Knowledge-Base/Audio-Hardware-Setup-Guide for recommended settings for many popular devices.
We also recommend updating your sound card or audio interface's drivers to the most recent version available from the
manufacturer's website.

Frequently asked questions
Audio and MIDI FAQs

Audio Driver Latency/Buffer Size Needs to be increased
If you are experiencing dropouts in the sense that the audio engine is completely stopping and Cakewalk is reporting “DROPOUT” in
the Control Bar’s Transport module, then you should try increasing your sound card's latency settings by doing the following:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings.
2. If you are using WDM/KS or MME(32-bit) drivers, adjust the Buffer Size slider to the right toward Safe.
3. If you are using ASIO drivers, click on the ASIO Panel button. This opens your sound card's proprietary control panel. If the
ASIO Panel button does not launch your device's control panel, try to open it from the Windows Control Panel or from the
Windows Task Bar.
Note: For the majority of dedicated audio interfaces you will want to use ASIO drivers for the best stability. This can be applied
by going to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording and setting Driver Mode to ASIO.
4. Increase the buffer settings from the ASIO Panel.
5. Click Apply and then OK to apply any changed settings.
6. Restart Cakewalk and then test performance again.

Hard disk Buffer Size settings need to be increased
If you are experiencing dropouts in the sense that events that aren't sounding and/or you are hearing pops and clicks at random
points in playback, then this behavior may be related to your hard disk buffer size settings. Typically when this is the case, projects
containing more tracks and more demanding virtual instruments that load large sample libraries will exhibit more clicks and pops
than simpler projects with lower track counts.
Try increasing Cakewalk's hard disk buffer settings by doing the following:
1. In Cakewalk, go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Sync and Caching.
2. Increase the Playback I/O Buffer Size and Record I/O Buffer Size values. Typically you will want to increase these settings in
double increments. For example, settings such as 128, 256, 512, 1024 and 2048 are recommended. 256 is the recommended
default starting point.
Note: It is not recommended to select Enable Read Caching and Enable Write Caching. Choosing either of these options lets
your software use the Windows disk cache while reading or writing audio data. Your software will usually perform best with all
caching disabled, which is the default setting. If your computer has an older IDE disk controller, or a disk controller that does not
use DMA transfers, enabling caching may improve audio performance.
3. Click Apply and then OK to apply any changed settings
4. Restart Cakewalk and then test performance again
Ultimately, the larger the hard disk buffer size, the easier it is for your hard disk to stream audio files with stability.
If neither of the above help, then you may want to look into more hardware specifics with your computer. There is a free utility called
LatencyMon that can test your system for DPC latency spikes. Essentially, if your system is experiencing these spikes, it can be
prone to clicks and pops and dropping audio samples. DPC latency spikes can interfere with all real-time audio and video streaming
applications on your computer. You can download the free utility from www.resplendence.com/latencymon.
A common cause of DPC Latency Spikes on laptop computers is built-in Wi-Fi adapters. Per the suggestions in the link above, you
might consider temporarily disabling your Network adapters from the Windows Device Manager to reduce your overall DPC Latency
and reduce the amount of clicks and pops. More detailed information in regards to how to use the utility, and suggested measures to
take, can be found at the link above.
Lastly, you should strongly consider disabling any services that are unnecessary for recording that run on your computer in the
background (such as anti-virus, anti-spyware software, gadgets and auto-updates).

Patching an effect into Cakewalk causes a dropout
You may have simply reached the maximum number of tracks and effects your CPU can handle. If this is the case, there are several
things you can try:

 Freeze tracks and synths that you presently don’t need to edit. For details, see “Freeze tracks and synths” on page 1006.
 Use the Bounce to clips command to mix down clips that contain a lot of edits (clip effects, automation, AudioSnap, etc). Doing
so will decrease the amount of data your system has to process simultaneously. For details, see “Bouncing to clips” on page 936.

 If you are using V-Vocal, a lot of processing power may be required from your system. For best performance, it is recommended
that you use a clip as small as possible to apply the V-Vocal effect, then use the Bounce to Clips command to mix down any final
V-Vocal Region FX clips that don’t require any more editing.

 Open the C:\Cakewalk Projects\Picture Cache folder and delete its contents (do not delete the folder itself). Doing so
will free up disk space so Cakewalk may perform more efficiently.
However, if Cakewalk’s CPU meter does not appear to be maxed out, or other plug-ins seem to work, you may need to address the
problem by editing a line in the Aud.ini file. You can edit the Aud.ini file from within Cakewalk.
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Configuration File.
2. In the Properties list, scroll down to the property named ExtraPluginBufs.
The default value of the ExtraPluginBufs variable is 0.
3. Change the value of ExtraPluginBufs to 1.
4. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box, then try to insert the effect that caused the dropout.
If you still experience a dropout, change the value of ExtraPluginBufs to 2. Continue to double the value of this variable until you
reach 128 (4, 8, 16, 32, etc.). If a value of 128 does not fix the problem, it is time to try something else. For more information about
potential dropout causes, see “Dropouts and other audio problems” on page 1373.

I hear an echo when I record
If you have input monitoring enabled, when you play an instrument that is plugged into your sound card, you hear the direct signal
that goes straight through your sound card, and then an instant later you hear the sound that is processed by Cakewalk, including
any plug-in effects you may be using.
You can eliminate the echo in either of two ways:

 Mute the direct signal so you only hear the sound that is processed by Cakewalk. If you choose this method, you may hear too
much of a lag between the time you play your instrument and the time you hear it, depending on the latency of your system (using
and audio device with ASIO drivers is a great way to achieve lower latency).
To mute your sound card’s direct sound:
1. Open the Windows Volume Control window:
• Windows 7: Click the Windows Start button and go to Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Volume Control.
The Volume Control window appears.
2. In the Play Control window of the mixer, select the Mute check box in the Line-In column, or in the column of whatever jack
your instrument is plugged into, and close the mixer window.

 Disable input monitoring so you only hear the raw signal that’s coming through your sound card. If you choose this method, you
won’t hear any plug-in effects you may be using.
To disable input monitoring:

 On the track where you want to disable input monitoring, click the track’s Input Echo button so that it is in the Off position:

Frequently asked questions
Audio and MIDI FAQs

When I record audio I get a flat line/silence
If you get silence when recording audio, make sure you are selecting the proper input for your audio track. For example, if your audio
interface has two inputs, the inputs that will most likely show up in Cakewalk as:

 Left Input 1-2
 Right Input 1-2
 Stereo Input 1-2
If you are plugging into input 1 on your device, select Left Input 1-2. If you are plugging into input 2, select Right Input 1-2. If you
are plugging into both, select Stereo Input 1-2.
If you are selecting the correct input in Cakewalk, but still recording silence, make sure the input on your sound card or audio
interface is configured properly. Many external audio interfaces have physical Gain or Sensitivity knobs for their pre-amps. Many
also have stand-alone control panels in Windows for controlling the input level and enabling Phantom Power, if necessary, for
condenser microphones.
If you are using the internal sound card in your computer, make sure you are turning up the input level on your internal sound card:
1. To open the Windows sound properties, right-click the small speaker icon near the system clock and select Sounds on the popup menu, or go to Start > Control Panel > Sound.
2. Click the Recording tab.
3. Right-click the input you are trying to record to and select Properties on the pop-up menu.
4. Click the Levels tab.
5. Adjust the slider to increase the amount of input signal.
More “Frequently asked questions” on page 1419.

My recording only records to one side and/or only plays out of one speaker
This is most likely the result of selecting a stereo input for your track, but only recording a mono source. If you do this, you will only
record to one channel of a stereo track and it will only come out of one speaker. Make sure you are selecting the proper input for
your audio track. For example, if your audio interface has two inputs, the inputs that will most likely show up in Cakewalk as:

 Left Input 1-2
 Right Input 1-2
 Stereo Input 1-2
If you are plugging into input 1 on your device, select Left Input 1-2. If you are plugging into input 2, select Right Input 1-2. If you
are plugging into both, select Stereo Input 1-2.
If your track was previously recorded as a stereo track and only has signal on one channel, you will be able to tell visually because
only one half (top or bottom) will show a waveform. If this is the case, you can convert it to a mono audio file by right-clicking the clip
and selecting Convert to Mono on the pop-up menu.

Bouncing tracks takes a long time
By default, Cakewalk uses a buffer for bouncing tracks that is the same size as the (Mixing Latency) Buffer Size value that you set
in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings. But with some projects, especially ones that use certain soft synths, the bounce
buffer needs to have its own value.

To change the BounceBufSizeMsec value
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio - Configuration File.
2. In the Properties list, change the BounceBufSizeMsec value to 100, or a value between 0 and 350 so that the bounce buffer
will use a more efficient size for bouncing, which has different requirements from normal playback latency.
Note: At a value of 0, the bounce buffer is the same size as the (Mixing Latency) Buffer Size value that you set in Edit >
Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings.
For more information, see “AUD.INI” on page 1470.

Plug-in windows flicker or don't display properly
X-Ray is not compatible with plug-ins that use DirectDraw to create their windows, such as many recent plug-ins by Waves. If a plugin is not compatible with X-Ray, the plug-in's window will either flicker or not display properly. If you have any plug-ins that are
affected by this, you can exclude the plug-in(s) from X-Ray by following these instructions:
1. Open the Cakewalk Plug-in Manager (Utilities > Cakewalk Plug-in Manager).
2. In the Plug-in Categories list, select the category that the plug-in you want to exclude is in.
3. In the Registered Plug-ins list, select the plug-in you want to exclude.
4. If the plug-in is a DirectX effect, write down (or select and copy) the CLSID value that's in the CLSID field at the bottom of the
dialog box.
5. If the plug-in is a VST or VSTi, write down the VST ID value that's in the VST ID field at the bottom of the dialog box.
6. Close the Cakewalk Plug-in Manager dialog box.
7. Use Notepad to open the XRayExclude.ini file that's in your Cakewalk program folder (C:\Documents and
Settings\<username>\Application Data\Cakewalk\Cakewalk <your version>.
8. At the end of the file, find the [EffectProps View] section.
9. Exclude your plug-in by creating a blank line below the last entry in the [EffectProps View] section, and then typing:
;[name of your plug-in, but without brackets]
XRayExclude[type the next available number in XRayExclude list, but without brackets]=[VST ID
number, with no brackets, or CLSID number, with curly braces at start and finish]
For example, if the last entry in the [EffectProps View] section was:
; Waves SSL EQ Stereo
XRayExclude11=1397510483
XRayExclude12={E451379E-F7E1-4E82-98D9-BEB87AC45E90}
If you want to exclude the Cakewalk FxDelay from the X-Ray Windows feature, after creating a blank line, type:
; Cakewalk FxDelay
XRayExclude13={985DAF67-589F-4B8D-8BBC-D7AD651B9022}
If there is also a VST version of the Cakewalk FxDelay, add another line:
XRayExclude14=[some VST ID number, with no brackets]
10. Save and close the XRayExclude.ini file, and restart Cakewalk to implement your changes.

My waveforms are gone, but I still hear audio; it says Busy in the corner of the
clip
If your audio clips are labeled “Busy”, the waveform display has not finished drawing yet, or may be corrupt. To force Cakewalk to
redraw waveforms in the current project, perform the following steps:
1. Press CTRL+A to select all clips.
2. Right-click any selected clip and select Associated Audio Files on the pop-up menu (or press SHIFT+K).
3. Click the Recompute Picture(s) button, then click OK to close the Associated Audio Files dialog box.
If you are still experiencing trouble with waveform redrawing, do the following:
1. Exit Cakewalk and navigate to C:\Cakewalk Projects\Picture Cache.
This is where Cakewalk stores the temporary waveform displays for recorded audio clips, but this folder does not contain any
actual audio data.
2. Press CTRL+A to select all files inside the folder, then press the DELETE key to delete the files.
Note: Do not delete the Picture Cache folder itself, only the files within the folder.

Cakewalk will automatically regenerate the waveform displays the next time you open the project.
If you still have trouble with waveform redrawing, please see “Optimized picture cache redrawing” on page 1381.
More “Frequently asked questions” on page 1419.

DPI scaling issue
DPI Scaling is a Windows setting that allows you to adjust the text size independent of what your graphic resolution is set to.
Unfortunately, if this is set above 100% (or Smaller depending on your Windows version), it can have some adverse effects visually
in Cakewalk as well as abnormal behavior.
The following are some common issues indicating the DPI Scaling is too high:

 Various parameters, such as faders jump erratically from the bottom to top (or vice versa), and do not scroll smoothly.
 Font scaling is large and skewed.
 Plug-in or ProChannel parameters do not properly respond.
 Other various visual anomalies.
If you experience any of the above, please verify your Windows DPI Setting is set to 96 or 100% (in Windows 8, it is simply called
Smaller)
In Windows 7: Go to Windows Start > Control Panel > Display > Set Custom text size (DPI)
In Windows 8: Go to Control Panel > Display > Change the size of all items, and set the value to Smaller.
If adjusting this setting makes it difficult to read what’s on the computer monitor, try decreasing the graphic resolution in Windows
Control Panel > Display. The minimum recommended resolution for Cakewalk is 1280x800.

I can’t open my project / File Recovery mode
Cakewalk 5 introduced a special diagnostic mode called Safe Mode to fix problems with project files that would not open. Safe mode
is activated when you open a file while the SHIFT key is pressed.
In certain rare circumstances, on attempting to open a project file you may see the following error message:
“This file you are trying to open is not compatible with this version of Cakewalk”
This message indicates that Cakewalk detected errors in the project file and was unable to open it. This normally indicates that your
project file has data corruption.
Data corruption on a DAW can occur due to various reasons, a few of which include:

 Your hard drive might suffer data loss.
 Windows delayed writes might fail leading to data corruption.
 Many hard disks have a “write through cache” buffer for efficiency. Occasionally this write through buffer might not get flushed due
to a driver error or system crash. In such cases data might not be flushed to your hard driver causing corrupt files (Cakewalk
requests Windows to flush this buffer after a file save operation).

 A plug-in can corrupt Cakewalk's memory space causing invalid data to be written to disk when the project is saved.
 During a file save the system can crash. In such situations, you will have a truncated file on disk.
You save a “recovery file” through Cakewalk's crash exception dialog box. When a crash occurs in Cakewalk, you are presented with
this dialog box allowing you to attempt to save a recovery file. While this works most of the time, occasionally Cakewalk may be in a
compromised state due to memory corruption. Under these circumstances, saving a file might cause a crash or the file might contain
invalid data.
In general, the best insurance against the data corruption scenarios above is to follow standard safe computing practices to guard
against data loss (keep regular backups, use autosave with versioning, etc.). However, occasionally you may be faced with a
situation where you do not have a backup copy of a critical project that now fails to open.
Cakewalk's File Recovery Mode offers a means to help recover data from damaged project files.

To use File Recovery mode
Do one of the following:

 If you are opening a file from the Most Recently Used files list in the File menu, hold down the SHIFT key while selecting file
name.

 If you are opening the file from the Open dialog box, select the file in the dialog box and hold down the SHIFT key while clicking
the OK button.

Frequently asked questions
General FAQs

What does File Recovery mode do?
File Recovery Mode applies the following behavior when opening a project file:

 Opens only the Track view, skipping all other opened views in the project including effects windows, Console View etc.
 Prompts you to open the plug-ins saved with your project. Each plug-in gets a prompt, so you can open some and not open
others.
Important: If you choose to not open a plug-in, that plug-in is stripped out of the project, so resaving the file will cause a loss
of any project specific settings for that plug-in.

 Ignores various strict error checks that would normally prevent a file from loading.
 Detects corrupt data and skips over “chunks” that are found to be invalid. E.g., if a track/event is detected to contain invalid data,
Cakewalk will attempt to skip over that track/event and proceed to load the next track/event.
In many cases, File Recovery Mode may be able to open damaged projects with minimal data loss. However, the level of success
depends on the nature and extent of the data corruption, so the results are not predictable. As a result of this, after opening a
damaged project in File Recovery Mode, you must carefully observe whether your settings have been retained or if the project
exhibits other problems. If you notice problems you should copy and paste the critical data from the recovered file into a brand new
empty project to start clean.
Important: Since File Recovery Mode ignores many critical error checks while loading a file, depending on the nature of the
data corruption in the file, it is possible that opening a file with File Recovery Mode might cause Cakewalk to crash or become
unresponsive. Please ensure that you save all your current work and close all open projects before attempting to open a file
with File Recovery Mode.
After loading a file with File Recovery Mode, it is recommended that you resave the file—preferably with a new name—and then shut
down and restart Cakewalk before proceeding.

Broadcast Waves import issue; imported wave files appear at the wrong
location
Sometimes when importing a wave file into a project, it may import way out into the project. A common symptom of this issue is
seeing an empty track with dots, indicating there is data later in the track.
This issue has to do with how the type of wave file itself is formatted. It is most likely a Broadcast Wave file that contains an
embedded timestamp. You can configure Cakewalk to obey or ignore the timestamp when importing Broadcast Wave files:
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > File - Audio Data.
2. Clear the Always Import Broadcast Waves at Their Timestamp check box, then click OK.
Broadcast Wave files will now import at the project’s Now time.

Silent Buses Detected
If you receive a Silent Buses Detected message after loading a project, it is simply indicating that a track or bus in your project
currently has its output assigned to None. This means the audio from that bus or track will never make it to your audio hardware, so
the result will be silence.
To correct this, in most cases you can simply re-assign the track/bus output from None back to your audio hardware. After reassigning the outputs, verify playback and resave your project.
If there are not other audio devices listed besides None, this indicates that Cakewalk has not been properly configured for use with
your audio device, or your audio device is simply not present. In order to assign the output of a track to your audio device, it must be
configured properly. To rectify this, please visit www.cakewalk.com/Support/hwsetup.aspx and follow the configuration instructions
for your device.

“Cannot open MASTER.INS. No instrument definitions will be available”
message when opening Cakewalk
You may get a “Cannot open MASTER.INS. No instrument definitions will be available” message when opening Cakewalk for
the first time.
The Master.ins file is used by Cakewalk to store instrument definitions for any hardware synthesizers you may own, but the file is
not required for Cakewalk's operation. The file simply allows you to see banks and programs by name in Cakewalk.
To re-generate the Master.ins file, do the following:
1. Hold down the SHIFT key when you start Cakewalk.
The following message appears: “Cakewalk will now personalize your user settings...”
2. Click OK.
Cakewalk copies over the Master.ins file behind the scenes and you will no longer receive this message.

Is there a Quick Start guide for getting started with Melodyne in Cakewalk?
Both Celemony and Cakewalk have very helpful guides for installing and using Melodyne in Cakewalk.
Cakewalk: “Melodyne” on page 1168
Celemony: http://helpcenter.celemony.com/editor2/en/singeltrack_daw_sonar.html

How do I insert Melodyne Essential into Cakewalk?
1. Select an audio region or clip you wish to process with Melodyne. To select a region on the timeline, use the Smart tool

or

and drag across the bottom part of the clip(s). To select an entire clip, simply click the clip. For details, see
Select tool
“Selecting clips” on page 496.
2. Do one of the following:

 In the Track view, click the Region FX menu, point to Melodyne, then select Create Region FX.
 Press CTRL+M.
The selected audio region is converted to a Melodyne Region FX clip, and the Melodyne editor appears in the MultiDock view.

I do not see Melodyne Essential under my Region FX menu. How do I get it to show up?
There are two primary reasons why Melodyne might not be detected by Cakewalk:

 Melodyne is not being scanned by Cakewalk's VST Scanner. If you have upgraded from a previous version of SONAR, you might
have automatic VST Scanning disabled. These settings could have migrated to Cakewalk. For information about re-scanning your
VST plug-ins, see www.cakewalk.com/Support/kb/reader.aspx/2007013315.

 You do not have the VST3 version of Melodyne installed. A VST3 version is required for ARA integration. More information about
this can be found in the following links:
www.cakewalk.com/Support/kb/reader.aspx/2007013316
www.cakewalk.com/Support/kb/reader.aspx/2007013317

Why is the polyphonic option under the Algorithm menu disabled in Melodyne Essential?
This feature is exclusive to the Editor version of Melodyne and is unavailable in the Melodyne Essential single track version included
with Cakewalk.

I already own a version of Melodyne Essential or Melodyne Editor. Do I still need to install the
Essential version included with Cakewalk for ARA integration?
No, you do not have to install Melodyne again from Cakewalk installer for ARA integration to work. You will, however, want to make
sure you have the VST3 version of Melodyne Editor installed since the VST3 version is a requirement. We recommend running the
latest updates from Celemony to make sure the VST3 version is installed.

Plug-in delay compensation re-sync
Some plug-ins such as iZotope Ozone 4 and various UAD plug-ins, change their internal delay (PDC) dynamically when certain
parameters are modified, presets are changed or internal plug-in routing is changed. When a plug-in changes its internal delay,
Cakewalk will detect this and re-sync all tracks in the project to this new delay value. While this is done you may hear a momentary
interruption in playing audio. This is normal and required in order to keep tracks in sync and delay compensated.

Backwards compatibility
Cakewalk can load projects from any previous versions of SONAR, but projects that are saved in Cakewalk cannot be re-opened in
SONAR 1.x or SONAR 2.x. In case you need to open a pre-Cakewalk project in an earlier version of SONAR, it is recommended that
you always create a backup copy of the original project before you re-save the project in Cakewalk.
Project files saved in Cakewalk will not open in SONAR 4 or earlier if they reference or include any of the following types of data or
information:

 32-bit and 64-bit audio clips, including clips and tracks that have been frozen or rendered as 32-bit or 64-bit data.
 Audio clips that are not all of the same bit depth.
 Patch points.
Project files saved in Cakewalk will not open in SONAR 5 if they reference 64-bit audio clips.
Project files saved in Cakewalk that contain multiple automation envelopes per track may appear like automation data is missing
when opened in an earlier version of SONAR. To see all automation data for a track right-click on it and choose Envelopes > Show
Track Envelopes and then select each envelope that you would like to show.
Cakewalk project files may contain new features that will be missing if opened in SONAR 5 and earlier, including:

 ACT current context.
 All AudioSnap data.
 Automation Read Enable states.
 Clip lock properties.
 Preserve Mix between Gain Members setting.
 Synth Rack Assignable Controls.
 Synth Rack Automation.
Cakewalk project files may contain new features that will be missing if opened in SONAR 4, including:

 Clip effects and clip automation:
 Effects are removed.
 Automation envelopes are orphaned.
 Groups:
 Cakewalk groups are preserved but will not be completely functional in SONAR 4.
 Controls may be removed from groups.
 Groups can't be added to or changed.
 Group names will be truncated.
 Cakewalk 4 may add extra groups to the project.
Re-saving a Cakewalk project file in an older version of SONAR may permanently remove the project data described above.
Template files saved from Cakewalk will not load in earlier versions of SONAR. This is because of changes made to Cakewalk's view
persistence code.

Connect your MIDI equipment
If you are using a MIDI interface (such as an MPU-401 or Sound Blaster MIDI option) with an external MIDI keyboard, you need to
connect the equipment using MIDI cables.
It is possible to connect your equipment in some rather complex ways that may cause problems. If you contact technical support with
a problem concerning equipment that doesn’t seem to be responding, we’ll probably suggest that you reconnect things in one of the
ways listed here before we explore the problem further. Also be sure to check the “Frequently asked questions” on page 1419
chapter before calling us.
There are two methods that fit many circumstances. The one you choose depends on whether your keyboard has:

 All three types of MIDI jacks: In, Out, and Thru
 Only two types of MIDI jacks: In and Out
If you have only one keyboard, read “If your keyboard doesn’t have a MIDI Thru jack” on page 1451 (regardless of whether you have
MIDI Thru or not).

If your keyboard has a MIDI Thru jack
If your keyboard has three MIDI jacks—In, Out, and Thru—then use the following diagram.

If you are using a 15-pin joystick adapter cable that splits into two MIDI cables:

 Connect the 15-pin jack to your computer’s joystick port.
 Connect the In cable to your instrument’s MIDI Out jack.
 Connect the Out cable to your instrument’s MIDI In jack.
Here’s a checklist:

Hardware setup
Connect your MIDI equipment

Continue the sequence, repeating the last connection for each of your sound modules.
Each MIDI device should be set to a unique MIDI channel or range of channels to avoid note-doubling. Refer to the manuals for your
MIDI devices for information on how to set their MIDI channels.
Your MIDI interface may have a Thru jack as well as In and Out jacks. If your master keyboard lacks MIDI Thru, you can add more
MIDI modules to your setup by connecting the MIDI interface’s Thru to the first module’s In. You can then chain subsequent modules
onto the first module, as described earlier.

If your keyboard doesn’t have a MIDI Thru jack
If your keyboard has only two MIDI jacks—In and Out—or if you have only one keyboard, use the following diagrams instead:

Each MIDI device should be set to a unique MIDI channel or range of channels to avoid note-doubling. Refer to the manuals for your
MIDI devices for information on how to set their MIDI channels.
If your master keyboard now seems to double notes (they sound thicker), or if you can play only one half as many at once, first make
sure that no MIDI channel is being used by more than one of your MIDI devices.

Set up to record digital audio
In general, the inputs of sound cards take 1/8 inch stereo mini-jacks. Sound cards usually have two inputs—one for line level inputs
and the other for microphones (at mic level). The line level input is stereo; the mic input could be either stereo or mono. If your final
output does not terminate in a 1/8 inch jack (and it probably doesn’t), you will need an adapter to plug it into your sound card.
Most sound cards use the Windows Volume Control to adjust the master input and output volumes and to control which recording
inputs are active. If you don’t hear audio tracks, or if you can’t easily control the audio volume in Cakewalk, go to Control Panel >
Hardware and Sound > Volume Control (Windows 7) and check the settings there. See your sound card’s documentation for
more.

Electric guitar direct-In
You can connect an electric guitar directly to your sound card using a 1/4 inch mono to 1/8 inch stereo adapter. The following
diagram shows this setup:

To sound card microphone input (mono)
1/4 inch instrument
cable
1/4 inch to 1/8 inch adapter

The 1/8 inch jack should be plugged into the sound card’s mic input, although plugging into the line input may also work.

Electric guitar through effects rack
You can also plug an electric guitar into an effects rack, then send the output of the rack to the sound card’s input, as shown in the
following diagram:

Rack effects units
Rack FX
Rack FX
Rack FX

1/4 inch to RCA adapter (x2)

Rack FX
1/4 inch instrument cable

To sound card line input (stereo)
RCA to 1/8 inch adapter (stereo)

This diagram assumes that the output of the rack is at line level. If it is at pro level instead (+4 dB), and your card does not accept a
+4 db input, you will need to attenuate (lower) the F/X rack’s signal. To do this, use a mixer between the rack’s output and the Yadapter. If the rack has only a mono output, a 1/4 inch mono to 1/8 inch stereo adapter should be used instead of a Y-adapter.
If you want to connect a guitar amplifier’s direct output to the sound card, you should base your setup on this example.

Set up to record digital audio

Microphone direct-In
Microphones can be plugged into the sound card’s mic input. Some inexpensive microphones are made especially for use with
sound cards and come equipped with 1/8 inch jacks. However, better quality microphones take better quality cables, which do not
terminate in 1/8 inch jacks. The following diagram illustrates how to connect a microphone that terminates in a 1/4 inch jack:

Microphone
To sound card microphone input (mono)
XLR to 1/4 inch microphone cable

1/4 inch to 1/8 inch adapter

Home Stereo, CD player, radio tuner, preamp output
The output of a stereo component can be connected to the sound card’s line in, using a dual RCA to 1/8 inch stereo mini Y-adapter.
Many portable cassette players come with this kind of adapter, or even with a single cable with all the necessary jacks. In the
following diagram, a stereo component is connected to the Y-adapter using standard RCA cables:
STEREO
RCA / left
RCA / right

ADAPTER

Y-adapter:
2x RCA to 1/8 inch stereo

Internal CD player
If you are using your computer’s internal CD player, and it does not have its audio outs connected internally to the sound card, run a
cable from the CD player’s Headphone jack to the card’s Line In jack. If there is no Headphone jack, you’ll need to use an external
CD player.

Hardware setup

Mixer
You can connect a mixer to the sound card with a setup of the following kind:

From sound card line output
to inputs #1 & 2
From Aux Bus #1 & 2
to sound card line
input
Stereo Amplifier
Main mixer outs to power amp

1/4 inch instrument cable to input #3

Note: If your mixer has buses, use them! This helps to avoid feedback.

MIDI files

The Standard MIDI file format is a file interchange format defined by the MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA). The purpose of the
format is to allow for the exchange of MIDI data between different programs. Any program that can read and write MIDI files has a
common language with which to talk to other MIDI software. The compact size of MIDI music files makes them particularly useful for
delivering music online.
Cakewalk can open standard MIDI files, and can save your projects in standard MIDI file formats. Note that only the MIDI portion of
your projects is saved in a standard MIDI file. If your projects contain digital audio, the audio portion of the project will be lost when
you save it to a standard MIDI file.
Note: If you load a standard MIDI file into Cakewalk, Cakewalk strips out any initial volume and pan settings and sets the volume
and pan controls for any affected tracks to those values. Initial volume and pan settings in a standard MIDI file are those that
occur within the first measure. Any affected volume and pan controls will show the initial values that Cakewalk loaded from the
standard MIDI file. Any volume and pan controls that are not affected, in other words that don’t have initial values stored in the
file, will show their current values in parentheses. These controls are disabled until you move one of them and therefore give it
a value, at which point the control becomes enabled and the parentheses disappear. If you save a file as a standard MIDI file,
Cakewalk saves the values of all enabled controls as initial values. However, as a project plays, Cakewalk’s controls do not
display MIDI controller values that change throughout the track—Cakewalk’s controls only display automation values, i.e.
shapes. If you want Cakewalk’s controls to display MIDI controller values throughout the project, use the Track view Clips >
Convert MIDI Controllers to Envelopes command. For details, see “Converting MIDI controllers to envelopes” on page 1234.
Cakewalk supports two different MIDI file formats, MIDI Format 0 and MIDI Format 1. Format 0 MIDI files contain a single track, with
all events stored in that track. Format 1 MIDI files can store up to 7256 tracks, just like Cakewalk project files. When you load a MIDI
Format 0 file, Cakewalk splits it into 16 separate tracks, based on the MIDI channels assigned to each event. When you save a
project to a MIDI Format 0 file, Cakewalk collapses MIDI information from all of its tracks into one single track.
Cakewalk also lets you save and load files in the RIFF MIDI file format. This is a standard Resource Interchange File Format
specification that encapsulates a Standard MIDI File of either format 0 or format 1. These files typically have an extension of .rmi.
A disadvantage of MIDI files is that the way the file sounds on playback varies based upon the sound reproduction hardware you are
using. The same project sounds very different on two different synthesizers or two different sound cards. Another problem is that the
Standard MIDI File specification leaves some details open to interpretation by software and hardware manufacturers.

To save a project as a Standard MIDI file or RIFF MIDI file
1. Choose File > Save As to display the Save As dialog box.
2. Choose the desired format from the Save as Type list.
3. Enter a file name and click Save.

MIDI files

1455

Timebases
MIDI files can be expressed in any of a number of timebases (ppq resolutions). It is likely that most MIDI files you will encounter use
a common timebase, such as 96 or 120. Although Cakewalk supports many timebases, it is possible that a MIDI file may use a
timebase that Cakewalk does not support. In that case, the times will be converted into whatever timebase is currently the default.

Supported MIDI file meta-events
MIDI files can contain meta-events. The types of meta-events that Cakewalk supports are listed in the following table.
MIDI File Meta-event

How it is represented in Cakewalk

Meter and key signature

Meter/key signature map entry

Tempo

General text

Track name

Markers view markers

Port number (format 1)

Port assignments are maintained. Only available when the Write Cable Meta Events to
MIDI Files (Output Select)

Features not supported by MIDI files
While the MIDI file format is very flexible and extensive, it cannot store the following parameters that are part of a standard project
file: key offset, velocity offset, time offset, and forced channel.
When you save a project to a MIDI file, most of these parameters are applied to the individual events. For instance, if you have
assigned track 1 to channel 10 in the Track view, Cakewalk will write the MIDI file so that every event on track 1 has a channel
number of 10. When you subsequently load the MIDI file all of those Track view parameters will have vanished. But the music will
sound the same, because Cakewalk has made these changes to the events themselves.

Other MIDI file handling notes
Here are a few specific points about how Cakewalk works with MIDI files:

 Cakewalk places Lyric events found in Format 0 MIDI files into Track 4, in accordance with conventions used by karaoke players.
 Cakewalk inserts any Text or Lyric events found at time 0 in a track into the Comments field in the File Info dialog box, unless the
Text or Lyric event is preceded by a Note event.

 Cakewalk automatically enables the Zero Controllers when Play Stops option (available in Edit > Preferences > Project MIDI) whenever a MIDI file is loaded.

 If a general MIDI file contains a copyright notice, the File Info window will be displayed automatically when the file is opened.

1456

MIDI files

Special handling of GM, GS, and XG MIDI files
General MIDI compatibility of a song file is indicated by the presence of a special System Exclusive message at the beginning of the
song. When Cakewalk finds a GM, GS or XG reset message, it assumes that you would like to work within the GM Score Production
guidelines. This causes Cakewalk to use special timing for program change information when writing MIDI Files, and allows it to
search more aggressively for track parameters when reading MIDI files. The result is that it is easier than ever to create and use
General MIDI song files with Cakewalk.
Cakewalk does not enforce or even verify compliance with the GM guidelines for your music data. But Cakewalk does comply with
them when generating events that represent track parameters. If necessary, Cakewalk will insert blank setup measures at the start
of your song. This makes space for certain events to be inserted at the correct times at the start of each track: bank changes, patch
changes, volume, and pan. This means that you can use Cakewalk’s track parameters for these settings when composing songs:
When you save your work as a MIDI File, Cakewalk will place these events in the track at the specific clock ticks recommended by
the guidelines.
You can tell Cakewalk to follow the GM guidelines by loading the “Turn GM System On” Sysx bank in the Sysx View (gmsystem.syx in
your Cakewalk directory), and then either inserting a sysx event at time 1:1:0 or using the Auto setting for that bank.
When loading a GM file, each track’s bank, patch, volume and pan parameters are lifted from the data stream and placed in
Cakewalk’s Track view for you to see and edit on-screen. The GM mode ensures that all patches, banks and controllers are placed
at specified times throughout a setup measure when you save a MIDI file. This ensures that all setup information can be digested by
your synthesizer before it starts playback. If you don't have a setup measure in your project, Cakewalk will insert one for you.
If there is no GM, GS, or XG reset System Exclusive message present at the start of your project, Cakewalk will not operate in this
GM mode.

If you have problems playing MIDI files
A MIDI file can cause playback problems if all of the following are true:

 The MIDI file is a GM-compatible Standard MIDI Format 1
 All patches, banks and/or controllers are stored in one track
 All related note events are stored in a different track
When Cakewalk loads such a file, it may try to optimize the program changes, causing incorrect selection of synthesizer voices
during playback (the GM, GS, and XG specifications all recommend the use of Standard MIDI Format 0 for distribution of music data,
which would make this problem irrelevant). If you encounter this problem, simply re-select your instruments and re-save the file.

1457

If you plan to publish your songs
If you plan to publish your own songs, we encourage you to follow the General MIDI authoring guidelines. These guidelines are quite
detailed about the exact layout of many types of song data, and a complete discussion of them can be found on the World Wide Web
at www.midi.org. However, Cakewalk can help you to conform with the GM guidelines if you follow these practices:

 Always save your master copy of any work in progress in Cakewalk project (.cwp) file format. When you are ready to publish your
work, use the File > Save As command to create a Standard MIDI Format 0 file.

 All of the major publishing guidelines recommend that you use Standard MIDI File Format 0 instead of Format 1. Some
sequencers cannot read the more complex Format 1 files, particularly sequencers embedded in some types of hardware such as
karaoke players.

 Load the “Turn GM System On” system exclusive bank (gmsystem.syx in your Cakewalk directory) in the Sysx view, and set the
bank to Auto Send. This message will not only re-initialize a General MIDI compatible sound module to a known state, but will
also tell Cakewalk to generate GM setup measures for your program changes when you save the project in Standard MIDI
Format. See “Variables in the [Options] section” on page 1467 for information on disabling setup measure.

 For best results, you should always place program changes and other MIDI messages in the same tracks as the notes they affect.
This keeps the data for each track together as a single unit, and avoids problems that might occur when Cakewalk cannot easily
correlate the program changes with the note events.

1458

Initialization files

Many Windows applications, as well as Windows itself, use files to store information about your preferences and configuration. Often
applications store values to these files when you make selections in the program using menus or dialog boxes. However, you can
also change these files directly. In some cases, there is no way to change the settings in the application, and changing the file
directly is the only way.

Initialization files
This appendix documents three initialization files, which are stored in the following folder:
%AppData%\Cakewalk\Cakewalk Core

 Cakewalk.ini
 TTSseq.ini
 Aud.ini
To view and edit the Cakewalk.ini file, choose Edit > Preferences > File - Initialization File. To view and edit the Aud.ini file,
choose Edit > Preferences > Audio - Configuration File. You can use Windows Notepad to open and alter any of the three files.
There are several other .ini files in the Cakewalk folder, but you should not attempt to edit or modify these files in any way. Changes
to these other files could cause Cakewalk to stop operating properly.
Before making any changes to any of the .ini files, you should make a backup copy in case you make a mistake. After you have
made your changes, save the file and close Notepad. Cakewalk reads the settings in these files only when it first starts up.
Therefore, if you change any settings while Cakewalk is running, you should exit and restart Cakewalk in order for the changes to
take effect.
See:
“Initialization file format” on page 1460

“Cakewalk.ini” on page 1461
“TTSSEQ.INI” on page 1467
“AUD.INI” on page 1470

Initialization file format
Initialization files all follow a common format. They are divided into sections whose names appear in the file in brackets, like this:
[Section Name]
Within each section, variables are of the form:
<variable name>=<value>
For example, the DrawPlayingAudio variable belongs in the [Wincake] section in Cakewalk.ini, and determines whether the
audio waveform is redrawn or not when the display is scrolling during playback. If the value is 0 (FALSE), then the waveforms are
not redrawn. If the value is 1 (TRUE), then waveforms are redrawn. To redraw waveforms when scrolling during playback, the entry
in the file looks like this:
[Wincake]
DrawPlayingAudio=1
The variable names contain no spaces. They are not case sensitive.

Cakewalk.ini
Many of the items in Cakewalk.ini are set using Cakewalk menus and dialog boxes. However, some items can be changed only
by using the Edit > Preferences > File - Initialization File command or by directly editing this file using the Windows Notepad.
Cakewalk.ini is divided into different sections. Unless otherwise noted, all entries should appear in the section that starts with the
line:
[Wincake]
For example, if you want to add the line AutoLoadAudioSnapPalette=0 to Cakewalk.ini, you should put it on the line under
[Wincake], like this:
[Wincake]
AutoLoadAudioSnapPalette=0
The following section lists the different variables you can change in Cakewalk.ini.
Variable

Type

Default value

What it does

AutoLoadAudioSnapPalette=<0 or
1>

Boolean

1

By default, the AudioSnap palette appears automatically
whenever you enable AudioSnap on a clip. If you prefer to never
auto-show the AudioSnap palette, you can change this behavior
by setting the value to 0.

CPUMeterMode=<0 - 2>

Integer

0

This variable specifies how the CPU meter appears in the status
bar on multiprocessor systems. The values are as follows:
0 = The peak thread load is displayed as the bar and a yellow
indicator shows the average of all audio threads. This the default
mode.
1 = The average audio thread load is displayed as the bar and a
yellow indicator shows the peak thread.
2 = A bar is shown for each audio thread. This is the same display
as previous versions of Cakewalk.

CreateNewGroupsOnPaste=<0 or 1> Boolean

1

When you copy and paste clips that belong to a clip group, this
variable specifies if the pasted clips should be placed in a new clip
group or continue to be grouped with the original clip group. By
default, a new clip group is created.
The values are as follows:
0 = The pasted clips will belong to the same clip group as the clips
that were copied.
1 = A new clip group is created for the pasted clips. This is the
default behavior.

CtrlSurfaceRefreshMS=<50 - 5000>

Integer

75

You may want to increase the value of this Cakewalk.ini
variable if you are experiencing sluggish UI responsiveness when
using a control surface and playing back high CPU projects.
Also, if you are using a control surface that is not bi-directional, the
surface does not need to be refreshed at all and you can safely
increase the value.

DrawPlayingAudio=< 0 or 1>

Boolean

0 (disable)

This line controls whether the audio waveform is redrawn or not
when the display is scrolling during playback. By setting the value
to 1, you can force the Track view to always redisplay audio data,
even during playback. This is recommended only for very fast
machines.

DrawToolbarGradient=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1

Global and view toolbars are drawn with a background gradient. If
you prefer a flat background, set the value to 0.

Table 97.

Variable

Type

Default value

What it does

EnablePluginCancelButton=<0 or 1> Boolean

0

In Cakewalk 4.0.2 and earlier, opening the property page of a VST
plug-in during playback could result in a slight disruption in
playback.
The cause for this problem has its roots in the little Cancel button
that sits in the top right corner of the plug-in's property page. The
purpose of this button is to allow the user to cancel out of any
changes they might have made to the plug-in, restoring back to
whatever state the plug-in was in before they opened the GUI
window. To make this work, Cakewalk would need to take an initial
snapshot of the plug-in's state, and some plug-ins with large
amounts of preset data could cause an audio hiccup if the data
was captured for the Cancel button.
To address this issue, Cakewalk 4.0.3 (and later) does not take a
snapshot of the plug-in's state by default, and the Cancel button is
not available.

EnableWin10DPIAwareness=<0 or
1>

Boolean

0 (disable)

[Experimental feature] This variable enables improved high DPI
rendering on Windows 10 build 1809 (October 2018) and above.
When enabled, the rendering quality of text and other GDI-based
primitives automatically improve when the window is displayed on
a high-DPI displays such as 4K monitors (may not be noticeable
unless your Windows display scaling setting is > 100%).
All Cakewalk UI is potentially affected, including menus and
dialogs, but plug-in windows are created without high DPI
rendering improvements to avoid UI issues.

ExceptionHandlingSeverity=<1, 3, 5,
or 7>

Integer

1

This variable controls the sensitivity for error detection.
The values are as follows:
1 = Unhandled errors are caught (default)
3 = All access violations are detected and unhandled exceptions
are caught
5 = Unhandled errors and heap corruption is detected
7 =Unhandled errors, all access violations and heap corruption
errors are caught (this is the strictest error detection mode)

ForegroundForSMPTE=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1 (enable)

This line specifies whether or not Cakewalk should jump to the
foreground (focus) once it locks to SMPTE.

HyphenDir=<drive:path name>

Path

<installation
directory>\ttshyph.dll

This determines the location of the Hyphenator extension .dll used
by Cakewalk, and is written during installation. This should never
need to be changed.

IconTopLeftPixelTransparent=<0 or
1>

Boolean

1

By default, track icons support transparency. The top left pixel in
the BMP determines the transparent color. If you prefer to not
have transparent icons, set the variable value to 0.
Note: When transparency is enabled, the global color entry
(Edit > Preferences > Customization - Colors) called “Track
View Icons Background” determines the background color
(“Console Strips Icons background” does the same for the
Console view and Track Inspector).

JogPosTimer=<milliseconds>
(default=120)
PauseOnJog=<0 or 1> (default=0;
off)

Table 97.

Cakewalk.ini (Continued)

1462

Initialization files
Initialization file format

There are two variables that control the behavior of using a control
surface jog wheel to change Cakewalk’s Now time:
JogPosTimer is the period of the now time throttle. When a jog
message comes in, Cakewalk sets the transport time immediately
but will not set the transport time again for this length of time.
During the time, Cakewalk just remembers the latest jog time
received.
PauseOnJog is the main switch. 1 does a pause and invokes the
throttle timer. 0 just sends the now time with no pause and no
throttle timer. If 0, the setting of JogPauseTimer is “don't care.”
For example:
[Wincake]
JogPosTimer=120
PauseOnJog=0

Variable

Type

Default value

What it does

LargeIconHeight=<num>

Integer

48

This variable specifies the large track icon size. By default, large
icons are 48x48 pixels.

MaxPanelUndoSteps=<num>

Integer

128

Each StudioWare view remembers a certain maximum number of
(Design mode) operations before discarding old ones. This line
lets you control the maximum depth of each Panel undo history.
Be aware that the larger the number you specify, the more
memory must be dedicated to storing the information required to
undo commands.

MicroscopeHZoomMax=<2.0 - 8.0>

Integer

3.0

This line specifies the highest horizontal magnification that will
result when using Microscope mode.

MicroscopeHZoomThreshold=<1..20 Integer
>

8

By default, the Microscope mode begins horizontal magnification
when a 32nd note is narrower than 8 pixels. This line lets you
specify the horizontal zoom threshold (1-20 pixels).

NoFontSmoothing=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

Set the value to 1 to disable font smoothing in Cakewalk. You
must restart Cakewalk in order for the change to take effect.

PanelsShowWidgetBitmaps=<0 or
1>

Boolean

1 (enable)

This line controls whether Cakewalk hides (n=0) or shows (n=1)
all widget bitmaps while in Use mode (except those in Image
widgets).

PanicStrength=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0 (controller 123 only)

The Panic/Reset button stops playback and turns off any stuck
notes. There are two ways a MIDI note can be turned off: By a
note-off message (n=1) or by MIDI controller number 123 (all
notes off). By default, Panic uses controller 123 only (n=0).

PauseDuringSave=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

By default, when saving a project file during playback, Cakewalk
saves the file asynchronously while playback continues. While this
is not a problem with most projects, complex projects under high
CPU load conditions (particularly while running under low latency)
may take longer to save than if the transport was not playing.
Setting PauseDuringSave to a value of 1 in the [Wincake]
section changes the default behavior and pauses playback
temporarily for the duration of the file save. This allows the file
save to proceed as fast as possible before playback resumes.

ProgressiveWavePictures=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1

This option enables progressive display of waveform pictures.
When enabled you will see pictures being displayed in the clips
view dynamically as they are being computed. The waveforms will
update in the background when the application is idle. If the
ComputePicturesWhilePlaying flag is set to 1, waveforms
will continue being displayed progressively even while audio
playback is in progress. This can save time waiting for a complete
picture to be finished before you can see it.

PRVColorizeVelocity=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1

By default, note events in the Piano Roll are colorized based on
velocity. Darker colors indicate higher velocities.
To override this and use the static track color instead, add the
following line to the [WinCake] section:
PRVColorizeVelocity=0

RechannelMIDI=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

This variable specifies if a MIDI track's forced channel should be
applied to channelized MIDI data when bouncing MIDI data, or
when saving Format 1 Standard MIDI files. The values are as
follows:
0 = Do not re-channelize MIDI events.
1 = Re-channelize MIDI events.

ShowClipShadow=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

By default, a drop shadow is not displayed on clips in the Track
view. To always display a drop shadow on clips, add this to the
[Wincake] section: ShowClipShadow=1

SmallIconHeight=<num>

Integer

32

This variable specifies the small track icon size. By default, small
icons are 32x32 pixels.

What it does

StaffViewChanSeparateVoice=<0 or
1>

Boolean

1 (enable)

This line specifies whether or not Cakewalk should treat channels
assigned to each note as separate voices. This is useful if you
want to force note stems up or down for different voices.

StaffViewPreScanMeasures=<num>

Integer

16 (measures)

This line specifies how far back (in measures) Cakewalk should
search for long elements in order to display them in the Staff view.
If a long element does not start within the specified time, then it
will not be displayed in the Staff view (although it will print).

TempoMapDecimationResolu Integer
tion=<0 - 3>

1 (240 ticks / 16th note)

Setting the value to 2 or 3 will increase the number of decimation
points, making the tempo changes more accurate, but will slow
down calculations when drawing envelopes.
The values are as follows:
1 = 240 ticks (16th Note)
2 = 120 ticks (32nd Note)
3 = 60 ticks (64th Note)
4 = 30 ticks (128th Note)
5 = 15 ticks (256th Note)
6 = 12 ticks (320th Note)
7 = 6 ticks (640th Note)
8 = 3 ticks (1280th Note)

TempoImportDecimationRes Integer
olution=<0 - 3>

1 (240 ticks / 16th note)

This variable should be left at 1 in most cases in order to pick up
most shapes.
The values are as follows:
1 = 240 ticks (16th Note)
2 = 120 ticks (32nd Note)
3 = 60 ticks (64th Note)
4 = 30 ticks (128th Note)
5 = 15 ticks (256th Note)
6 = 12 ticks (320th Note)
7 = 6 ticks (640th Note)
8 = 3 ticks (1280th Note)

TempoImportErrorThreshol Integer
d=<0 - 250>

10

This variable controls how close the tempo entries have to match
points on a candidate curve before this curve is chosen. The best
fit curve will always be chosen first, but this threshold determines
whether to go with that curve or continue with discrete points.
Valid entries are 0 to 250 ( 0.00 to 0.25 ). The default is 10, which
equates to a difference of 0.01 of four point differences added
together.
A value of 0 effectively means import everything as discrete jump
values.

ToolTempFileDir=<drive:path name>

Path

<Windows TEMP
directory>

This line specifies where to store temporary .wav files when
launching a third party wave editor from the Utilities menu.

TransparentClipNames=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

Cakewalk can write Clip Names with an alpha channel such that
the waveform behind the clip name can be seen.
To enable this effect, set the value to 1.

TVBoldStripNames=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1

Specifies whether track/bus names use bold (value=1) or regular
(value=0) font style in the Track view.

TVControlHeight=<number of pixels> Integer

17

Specifies the height of controls in the Track view. The value
shouldn't be changed more than 1 or 2 from the default value, or
you may experience unexpected results.

Integer

2

Specifies the horizontal space between each button in a “cluster”.
The default value is 2 pixels. The following controls are grouped
into clusters:
• Mute, Solo, Arm for Recording (MSR)
• Automation Read, Automation Write
• Phase, Interleave (mono/stereo)

TVWidgetsStickInHeader=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

By default, Track view controls (widgets) will only appear in the
track header bar if the track is minimized and there is enough
room to display at least one control.
When TRUE (value=1) widgets stay in the header bar regardless
of the height of a track.
Note: the following controls will never appear in the track header
bar: Send widgets, meters, and vertical FX Rack.

UseArrSecEndForMarkerNavigation

Boolean

0

Allow the right edge (end) of Arranger sections to be treated as
markers for navigation (including using a control surface).

UseArrSecStartForMarkerNavigation Boolean
=<0 or 1>

1

Allow the left edge (start) of Arranger sections to be treated as
markers for navigation (including using a control surface).

UseLinkedClipsInApplyArrangement
=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

Create linked clips when applying an arrangement.

VelocityAsBargraph=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

By default, note velocity tails are displayed as thin vertical lines in
the Piano Roll view, and the color is the same as note events. If
“Notes/Velocity” is not the current edit type, this color will be
slightly lightened.
To override this and use bar graph indicators for velocity tails, add
the following line to the [WinCake] section:
VelocityAsBargraph=1

VelocityAutoshrinkWidth=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

If you set this to 1, solid velocity tails will become narrower by one
pixel if the vertical zoom is such that notes are less than 5 pixels
high. For example, with:
[Wincake]
VelocitySolidWidth=2
VelocityAutoshrinkWidth=1
you get bigger velocity tails (ala Cakewalk 4) when the notes are
big enough to edit, but really thin velocities tails when the notes
are too small to edit.

VelocityBargraphFullWidth=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

When displaying velocity tails as bar graphs (see above), you can
specify whether the velocity tails should be fixed at 3 pixels wide
(default), or extend the full width of the note event. To display fullwidth velocity tails, add the following line to the [WinCake]
section:
VelocityBargraphFullWidth=1

VelocitySolidWidth=<1..4>

Integer

1

By default, note velocity tails are displayed as 1 pixel wide solid
vertical lines in the Piano Roll view. To make the velocity tails
wider (2-4 pixels wide), add the following line to Cakewalk.ini
in the [WinCake] section:
VelocitySolidWidth=<pixel size; 1-4>
For example:
VelocitySolidWidth=2

VSTPlugInNameFormat=<0 - 3>

Integer

0

This variable specifies how VST plug-in names are formatted in
the Browser, FX Rack context menus, and anywhere else VST
plug-in names are displayed. The values are as follows:
0 = VST Name
1 = DLL Name
2 = VST Name (DLL Name)
3 = DLL Name (VST Name)

WavePreviewInputBuffers=<1-4>

Integer

4

This variable allows control of the number of Waveform preview
input buffers. The input buffers allow more efficient access to the
recorded meter history on disk, and greatly speeds up
performance access to previews while zooming and scrolling the
clips view when waveform preview is active. You can control the
actual number of history page buffers with this variable. This value
is an integer and the minimum value is 1 and the default is 4
buffers. 2-4 buffers should be sufficient for most usage scenarios.
Each buffer consumes approx 32K per preview track. Lower
values consume less memory but may cause more disk access
when scrolling or zooming large projects when preview is active.

WavePreviewSampleFrequency=<1- Integer
10>

1

By default, waveform previews take a meter sample for each
meter frame. The default interval between meter frames is 40
milliseconds. The WavePreviewSampleFrequency
Cakewalk.ini variable lets you specify how frequently samples
are taken. The value can be an integer between 1 and 10, and
represents the number of frames to sample. It goes in the
[Wincake] section of Cakewalk.ini. For example:
WavePreviewSampleFrequency=1
With the default value (1), every meter frame gets written to the
history file. With higher values (2-10), frames will be skipped,
causing fewer history frames to be written to the history file.
Higher values may be desirable if the waveform previews are
affecting playback performance.

Variables in the [Options] section

Variable

Type

Default value

What it does

ChaseDelay=<num>

Integer

20 (2 seconds)

This line specifies the sync chase delay in 1/10 seconds. During
SMPTE/MTC sync, when the position is determined, playback begins
at a later time to allow for setup. This line specifies the delay amount.
If this value is too long, you always have to wait after starting
playback before Cakewalk locks. If this value is too short—especially
on slower computers—then it will try to play before it’s ready, which
will cause a spurt of notes to catch up when it actually starts, the
effort of which could also cause sync to give up if the CPU is really
overtaxed.

FlywheelAmount=<num>

Integer

5 (½ second)

This line specifies the SMPTE flywheel time in 1/10 seconds. This is
the maximum dropout time length Cakewalk will allow before
aborting sync.

GeneralMidiSMFs=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1 (enable)

This line controls whether or not Cakewalk creates a General MIDI
setup measure when loading Standard MIDI Files.

IgnoreMidiInTimeStamps=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0 (disable)

This line determines whether or not Cakewalk ignores any MIDI time
stamping that a MIDI driver does. If you’re experiencing increasing
delays between the time you play a MIDI note on a controller and the
time you hear Cakewalk echo it, setting this line to 1 may help. Also,
if you find that Cakewalk is recording MIDI data at a different time
from when the data was played, setting this line to 1 may help. If the
MIDI driver is using a different clock from Cakewalk, the time
discrepancy increases the longer that the MIDI driver is open, so you
need to tell Cakewalk to ignore the timestamp that the MIDI driver
adds to the data (set the value to 1).

LoadTrackParams=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1 (enable)

LyricTrack=<num>

Integer

3 (track 4)

This line specifies which track is to contain lyrics from Type 0
Standard MIDI files. A zero means track 1, a 1 means track 2, and so
on.

MfxLookAhead=<ticks>

Integer

960*4

Defines how much extra MIDI data is sent to MFX plug-ins, so that
they have extra room to quantize events into the future. Lower values
mean MFX plug-ins can work more "just in time." Example:
MfxLookAhead=480.

MMCDelayMsecs=<num>

Integer

100

This setting specifies the minimum amount of time that must elapse
between any two MMC commands. Some MMC gear, including the
Fostex MTC-1 and the Tascam SY-88, can get confused unless there
is at least a 10-millisecond delay after every MMC command. This
can cause intermittent problems on fast machines. Cakewalk
corrects this problem with the MMCDelayMsecs=<n> line. The
default value is 100 milliseconds, although some experimentation
may be required to find the proper value for your system.

MMCPort=<num>

Integer

-1 (all)

By default, Cakewalk will transit MMC commands on all MIDI
outputs. In some situations it is necessary to limit the number of
outputs MMC is transmitting on. This line specifies which output
MMC is to be transmitted on. The value is 0 based, so a value of 0
means output 1, and a value of 1 means output 2, etc.

What it does

MMCPreRoll=<num>

Integer

20 (2 seconds)

This line specifies the MMC pre-locate amount in 1/10 seconds. By
default, Cakewalk waits for two seconds after it starts receiving time
code before beginning to playback or record. You can add this line to
change the two-second delay.
If this setting does not exist, the value of the ChaseDelay setting is
used. If the ChaseDelay setting does not exist either, then the
default for MMCPreRoll is 20.

MMCUseEvent=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1 (enable)

If all MMC features work except for Auto Punch record mode, your
equipment probably doesn't support the MMC Event command
(consult with the manufacturer if you aren't sure). You can overcome
this limitation by adding this line.

SendLocalOff=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1 (enable)

This line determines whether or not Cakewalk should send a Local
Control OFF message during startup.

SendLocalOn=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0 (disable)

This line determines whether or not Cakewalk should send a Local
Control ON message at exit.

SendResetsToSoftSynths=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

This variable controls (globally) whether Cakewalk sends MIDI
controller resets to DXi’s.
This variable should be set in the [OPTIONS] section. Legal values
are:
0 (default): Resets are not sent to DXi’s
1: Cakewalk will send MIDI controller resets to DXi’s. This is what
Cakewalk already does for hardware synths. For example:
If you are freezing synth tracks that have MIDI controller messages,
setting this variable to TRUE (1) will ensure that synths will have their
MIDI controllers reset before a freeze operation.

SyncAllowRateTweak=< 0 or 1>

Boolean

1 (enable)

When synching to SMPTE, Cakewalk normally attempts to track the
rate of the incoming sync signal, in order to survive dropouts better
when the SMPTE source speed is slightly off. Setting this to 0
defeats this. If you have a slower computer and dense work to play,
defeating this can result in a small efficiency improvement and also
prevent rate-tracking timing inaccuracies when the computer is so
busy that it’s late processing incoming sync messages.

SysxDelayAfterF7=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1 (enable)

This setting causes Cakewalk to delay Sysx transmission for a
certain amount of time if it encounters an F7 in a Sysx bank. This
gives some instruments a required amount of delay time that is
necessary to process the Sysx transmission. The default delay is 1/
18 of a second, but can be changed by also adding the
SysxSendDelayMsecs=<n> line.
The possible values are 0 and 1. Their significance is as follows:
0: no delay
1: delay between each Sysx string (F0 … F7)

SysxSendDelayMsecs=<num>

Integer

60

This setting causes Cakewalk to delay a specified number of
milliseconds if it encounters an F7 in a Sysx bank.

SysxSendPacketSize=<num>

Integer

1024

This line specifies the number of bytes between Sysx transmit
delays. Sysx bytes are transmitted in packets, with a 1/18 second
delay between each packet. Setting this value smaller will help
slower MIDI devices (synthesizers, etc.) avoid overflowing their
internal buffers.

UseCableMetaEvents=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1 (enable)

This line specifies whether or not Cakewalk should use nonstandard
“Cable” meta-events for storing Sysx bank output number into
Standard MIDI files (by default, n=1).

Default Value

What it does

{Plug-in CLSID}..SampleRate=<0 384000>

Integer

0

This variable goes in the [PluginUpsampler] section, and specifies the
per plug-in upsampling rate. It defaults to a value of 0 (zero), which
means “resample at twice the project sample rate”. The max sample
rate is 384000 Hz. This variable is not stored in the Aud.ini file by
default, so it must be manually added if you want to change a plug-in’s
upsample rate.
For details, see “Upsampling settings” on page 1011.

{Plug-in CLSID}.EnableFlags=<0 - 3>

Integer

0

This variable goes in the [PluginUpsampler] section, and specifies
whether resampling is applied. It corresponds to the Upsample on
Render and Upsample on Playback settings in Cakewalk’s UI. Valid
values are as follows:
• 0 = Disables upsampling
• 1 = Enables upsampling at render time
• 2 = Enables upsampling during playback
• 3 = Enables upsampling at render time and during playback
For details, see “Upsampling settings” on page 1011.

AllowOfflineRenderMixThreads=<0 or
1>

Boolean

1

A value of 1 (default) allows multiprocessing during fast bounce when
multiprocessing is enabled in Cakewalk. Set to 0 to temporarily disable
multi-threaded mixing during a fast bounce operation.

BounceBufSizeMsec=<0 to 350>

Integer

0

This is a line in the Wave section of the Aud.ini file that sets the
buffer size for bouncing tracks. At a value of 0, the bounce buffer is the
same size as the Mixing Latency value that you set in Edit >
Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings. If you find that bouncing
tracks, especially with certain soft synths, takes a very long time, you
can set this value to 100, or some value between 0 and 350 so that the
bounce buffer will use a more efficient size for bouncing, which has
different requirements from normal playback latency.
Note: on larger projects, setting this variable to a large value can
cause out-of-memory errors.

BounceFlushTailsMaxDurationSec=<0

Integer

20

Effects tails maximum flush length while bouncing (seconds). On
export, the engine will first hard flush any effects tails from all active
plug-ins referenced in the project, including track/bus effects, clip
effects, effects chains, ProChannel as well as instruments.
Specify the max duration (in seconds) to stream silence through all
plug-ins.
By default, tails are flushed until a threshold of -70dB is reached or 20
seconds of silence is detected, whichever occurs first.

Effects tails flush gain threshold while bouncing (dB). On export, the
engine will first hard flush any effects tails from all active plug-ins
referenced in the project, including track/bus effects, clip effects,
effects chains, ProChannel as well as instruments.
Tails are flushed until the specified dB threshold is reached, or until the
BounceFlushTailsMaxDurationSec duration is reached,
whichever occurs first.

ComputePicturesWhilePlaying=<1 or
0>

Boolean

1

This option allows waveform pictures to be computed in the
background while audio playback is in progress. Most modern
computers should be able to handle this load with no problems. Note
that work is only done while new pictures are actually being
computed—once the pictures are finished rendering there is no
overhead.

DefaultEqPosition=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

The integrated channel EQ is pre FX Rack by default, but you can
change the position of any channel EQ by right-clicking the EQ plot
and choosing the desired position from the context menu.
The DefaultEqPosition Aud.ini variable lets you specify the
default EQ position for all new tracks/buses. This variable lives in the
[Aud] section of Aud.ini, and legal values are: 0 (pre FX) or 1 (post
FX).

DropoutMsec=<num>

Integer

250

Under high system load conditions, the Cakewalk audio pump
mechanism may become starved. When this condition is detected,
Cakewalk drops out. The DropoutMsec variable allows you to
configure the tolerance time in milliseconds. This variable applies to all
driver modes.
Setting DropoutMsec to a positive value > 0 specifies the actual time
in milliseconds to tolerate before dropping out due to starvation.
Setting DropoutMsec to a negative value < 0 means we use a multiple
of the audio buffer size as the tolerance. i.e. -2 means we use twice
the audio buffer size.
Note that setting this value too low (e.g. 0) can result in more frequent
dropouts in the program. If you notice too many dropouts, try raising it
in buffer multiples or by explicitly specifying a millisecond value.

EnableCacheWriteThru=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1

This variable enables disk write thru caching. When write thru caching
is on, data recorded to wave files is written to the hard disk
immediately, circumventing the hardware disk cache. Having write thru
caching off can be more efficient for disk I/O but can result in data loss
if your system crashes.

EnablePicCacheThreads=<1 or 0>

Boolean

1

This option creates extra background worker threads for the
generation of wave pictures when you load a project. One worker
thread is automatically created per CPU/. Setting
EnablePicCacheThreads=0 reverts back to only using a single
thread for picture computation.
If you are running a system with multiple CPU's or cores setting this to
1 can greatly speed up the computation of pictures.

EnableWasapiDSP=<0 - 3>

Integer

1

This variable goes in the [Wave] section and allows you to enable or
disable DSP effects on inputs and output devices in WASAPI Shared
mode in Windows 10 and later.
Valid values are as follows:
• 0 = Disable all signal processing for inputs and outputs (RAW
mode)
• 1 = Enable signal processing for inputs (default)
• 2 = Enable signal processing for outputs
• 3 = Enable signal processing for inputs and outputs
For details, see “To enable/disable built-in DSP” on page 1383.

ExtraPluginBufs=<0 to no upper limit>

integer

0

It instructs Cakewalk to set aside extra audio data buffers, to
accommodate plug-ins which do large amount of internal buffering and
therefore “keep” data buffers to themselves. Recommended maximum
setting of 64 or 128.

Variable

Type

Default Value

What it does

FlushMultiple=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1

This variable determines how Cakewalk performs writes to disk in
cases where multiple inputs are being recorded simultaneously. The
default setting causes Cakewalk to write all the data for all inputs all at
once, and then wait for the entire set of writes to complete. Overriding
this value by setting it to 0 causes Cakewalk to perform each input’s
write separately, and wait for each individual write to complete before
proceeding to the next one.

FlushWriteBeforeRead=<1 or 0>

Boolean

0

The default setting causes Cakewalk to perform disk reads (for audio
playback) before attempting any disk writes (for audio recording).
Overriding this value by setting it to 1 causes Cakewalk to attempt disk
writes first. This yields the best results when you are attempting to
record a large number of tracks at high latency.

GapDezipperUsec=<0-1000>

Integer

500

The audio engine will now render a smooth fade in whenever audio
playback is interrupted and there is an abrupt transition in gain. The
purpose of doing this is to dezipper (smooth out) the gain transition
due to the discontinuity. For example, if you click on the Time Ruler to
jump to a new time location during playback, the engine will smoothly
render the transition to the new gain level as a fade in. This smoothing
also takes place whenever playback gapping occurs. You can control
the fade in time via the GapDezipperUsec variable, which is
expressed in microseconds per dB and controls the speed of the fade
in to the new gain value. (default = 500 microseconds. i.e. the fade will
take 500 microseconds per change in dB at the transition point). You
may increase or shorten the time of the fade by increasing or
decreasing this value. The normal legal value range for this variable is
0 to 1000 microseconds.
This variable should be set in the [Wave] section. A value of zero
turns off dezippering on gapping completely.

LinkPFSendMute=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

If this is set TRUE, pre fader sends on both tracks and buses are
automatically muted when the track/bus is muted. Also if another track
is soloed the pre fader sends on other tracks will be muted.
This basically conforms to pre Cakewalk 4 behavior.

ManageASIOThreadPriority=<0 or 1>

Integer

1

This determines whether Cakewalk manages the ASIO thread priority
when necessary. This defaults to 1.

MaskDropoutDetection=<0 or

Boolean

0

This variable allows you to suppress audio engine dropouts.
By setting the value to 1, Cakewalk will mask detection of performance
related dropouts during playback and recording in order to prevent
engine dropouts.
This may be desirable in certain situations, such as when doing an
unattended recording or playing back in a live scenario.
For details, see “Dropouts and other audio problems” on page 1373.

MaxPreviewMsec=<num>

Integer

300000

This variable goes in the [Wave] section, and specifies the max
preview duration (in milliseconds) in the Media Browser.

MeterFrameSizeMS=<10-200>

Integer

40

Meters in Cakewalk show peak (or RMS) values at a given instant in
time. The actual peak value displayed by a meter is the highest peak
recorded in an interval of time referred to as a “Meter Frame.” The
default size for a meter frame is 40 milliseconds, which is an accuracy
of 25 FPS. The MeterFrameSizeMS variable allows you to change
the size of this interval. It goes in the [Wave] section. For example:
[Wave]
MeterFramSizeMS=40
Setting this value to a lower value will make the meters record peak
info for smaller time slices. However this can also increase the
metering CPU and memory cost.
Note: although Cakewalk doesn’t enforce a fixed value range, the
recommended range should be between 10 and 200 milliseconds.

Variable

Type

Default Value

What it does

MinimizeDriverStateChanges=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1

This is a line in the Wave section of the Aud.ini file that controls
whether or not audio devices are reset in response to transport
changes (play/stop).
Valid values are as follows:
0 = off.
1 = On for ASIO only (default).
2 = On for WDM only.
3 = On for both ASIO and WDM.

MinPluginLoadBalancingBufferSamples Integer
=<32 - 256>

128

This variable goes in the [Wave] section and controls the size of the
smallest internal buffer subdivision that may be used for plug-in load
balancing.
For details, see “Plug-in load balancing” on page 1363.

MixDezipperUsec=<0-1000>

Integer

50

This variable is similar to GapDezipperUsec except that it controls
how the mixer itself renders abrupt gain transitions due to envelopes in
the project. This variable is expressed in microseconds per dB and
controls the speed of the fade in to the new gain value (default = 50
microseconds). The normal legal value range for this variable is 0 to
1000 microseconds.
This variable should be set in the [Wave] section. Important:
Changing the value of this variable will affect how envelopes are
rendered by the mixer and may cause your mixes to sound slightly
different. Setting MixDezipperUsec too low can cause clicks while
rendering abrupt gain changes due to envelopes.

MMCSSTaskKey=<task name>

Name

Pro Audio

By default, Cakewalk uses the MMCSS task profile named Pro Audio.
If desired, you can instruct Cakewalk to use a custom MMCSS task
profile.

PanLawCompatMode=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

When using a non-default pan law with floating point or 24-bit audio,
SONAR would previously apply the pan law twice; once at the clip
level and once more at the track level.
In SONAR 8.5.2 and later, pan laws are only applied once at the track
level and only for mono tracks. Any clip pan envelopes will continue to
work, but behave strictly as a balance control.
If you have existing projects that use a non-default pan law (i.e. other
than 0dB center sin/cos taper), the mix might sound louder in
Cakewalk.
When the value is 0 (default), non-default pan laws are not applied at
the clip level. Clip pan envelopes always use the (0dB center sin/cos
taper) law.
When the value is 1, pan laws are applied at the clip level. It is not
recommended that you use this value unless you need to retain
backwards compatibility with pre-Cakewalk projects that use a nondefault pan law.

PicCacheMB=<size in MB>

Integer

20

This variable specifies the maximum size of the picture cache. The
picture cache is located in the directory specified by the
PictureDir=<path> variable (defaults to <Cakewalk
Folder>\Picture Cache).

PictureDir=<drive:path name>

Path

<Cakewalk
directory>\Picture
Cache

This line specifies where to store the picture cache.

RealtimePreroll=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

This variable specifies whether preroll buffers are pumped as fast as
possible or in real-time.
Prerolling in realtime may improve buffering and CPU load when using
hardware DSP solutions such as the Universal Audio UAD-1 or
Focusrite Liquid Mix.

Variable

Type

Default Value

What it does

RestartEngineAfterDropout =<0 or 1>

Boolean

1

This variable specifies whether the audio engine should restart
automatically when certain kinds of benign dropouts are detected. If
playback is underway, the dropout is handled and playback resumes
automatically from where it left off.
Set to 0 to instead stop playback and display a dropout toast
notification. Note: If enabled, you will still get a dropout notification if a
dropout occurs during recording.

ShowMultiChannelInputs =<0 or 1>

Boolean

1

This is a line in the Wave section of the Aud.ini file that specifies
whether Cakewalk uses multichannel audio devices as multiple stereo
pairs or just a single stereo pair.

ShowMultiChannelOutputs=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1

This is a line in the Wave section of the Aud.ini file that specifies
whether Cakewalk uses multichannel audio devices as multiple stereo
pairs or just a single stereo pair.

StopEngineOnASIOPanelOpen =<0 or
1>

Boolean

1

A few ASIO devices require that the host should not use the device
while making changes to device settings. Some devices may display
an error or gray out the controls in the ASIO panel while others may
silently ignore changes.
Set this variable to 1 to automatically stop and release the ASIO
interface allowing you to change settings in Cakewalk.

SuspendPluginsOnBounce=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1

This is a line in the [Wave] section of the Aud.ini file that controls
whether VST plug-ins are suspended and resumed prior to starting a
bounce operation.
When set to 1 (default), VST plug-ins are suspended and resumed
both before and after the bounce process. This flushes any residual
buffers that might be present from plug-ins that have internal latency.

ThreadSchedulingModel=<0 - 2>

Integer

1

This variable goes in the [Wave] section and controls the interaction
of the main audio thread and worker threads on multiprocessor
systems when the Use Multiprocessing Engine option is enabled.
Depending on the system, a particular model may result in less
glitching and better overall performance. The values are as follows:
0 = Same as previous versions of Cakewalk.
1 = (default) Better thread balance. Model is more efficient and can
provide cycles for other tasks.
2 = Additional worker thread is created. This may result in
improvement with Quad processor systems or higher. Not
recommended for Dual processor systems.
3 = Agressive

Use24BitExtensible=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

This line goes in the section of the Aud.ini file under [name of your
sound card (‘n’ in , ‘n’ out) ]. If you get an error message when you try
to change the audio driver bit depth to 24, try setting this line to 1. Most
USB audio devices that use WDM drivers need this line set to 1.

UseHardwareSamplePosition=<0 or 1>

Boolean

0

This variable applies to ASIO mode only and controls whether
Cakewalk internally compute the sample position based on buffer
switch calls or uses the ASIOGetSamplePosition reported value to
retrieve the driver reported value.
Some drivers change the reported sample position based on how long
a buffer switch took to complete and this can cause problems since
Cakewalk expects the reported position to be in sync with the number
of buffers actually streamed.

Default Value

What it does

VideoEngine=<0 or 1>

Boolean

1

This variable goes in the [Video] section, and specifies the default
video engine. For example:
[Video]
VideoEngine=1
The values are as follows:
0 = DirectShow engine
1 = Media Foundation engine

WaveInBuffers=<2 - 8>

Integer

8

When using the External Insert plug-in alongside the original dry signal
in WDM mode, you might notice a flanging or flamming effect. To
minimize this effect, we recommend that you set the WaveInBuffers
Aud.ini variable to 2.
Note: Setting the value to 2 might have an adverse effect with certain
audio hardware, causing recording to drop out. If this occurs, reset the
value to 8 and try using ASIO drivers if your hardware has ASIO
support.

Alias Factor
Figure 578. Alias Factor.

Alias Factor combines bit crushing and low pass filtering in a unique way, allowing you to decimate your audio to create tones as
varied as vintage samplers, cell phones, or old video games. Decimator effects are nothing new, but Alias Factor generates this
effect using a special technique that generates aliasing without the unwanted harsh effects provided by other options, offering
sounds that are grainy in a “smooth” and organic way. Alias Factor also allows for further creation of attention grabbing new timbres
by linking a low pass resonant filter to the decimator for a new means of tweaking your sound.
For more information, see the Alias Factor online Help.

Boost 11 Peak Limiter
Figure 579. Boost 11 Peak Limiter.

The Boost 11 Peak Limiter is a transparent peak limiting and volume maximizing plug-in for mixing and mastering purposes; it is
designed to reduce peak levels without coloring the sound. Boost 11 uses a “look-ahead” limiter algorithm to prevent output clipping
and PDR (Program Dependent Release) to minimize pumping (audible fluctuations of the volume) and maximize the loudness.
“Look-ahead” means the limiter analyzes the audio input ahead of time by delaying the output for approximately 1.5 ms. Boost 11
supports sampling rates up to 192 kHz, mono and stereo operation, and double precision processing.
Boost 11’s features include:

 Look-ahead peak detection prevents clipping
 Program Dependent Release minimizes pumping
 Dynamic waveform displays of input versus output
 Stereo peak and RMS input/output meters
 Operation at sampling rates up to 192 kHz
 64-bit double precision signal path
 VST Automation

Classic Phaser
Figure 582. Classic Phaser.

This is a classic phaser effect that uses a modulating notch filter with a feedback loop. The “Quadra” mode provides extra wide
imaging and animation.
For more information, see the Classic Phaser online Help.

Compressor/Gate
Figure 583. Stereo Compressor/Gate.

Stereo Compressor/Gate combines a compressor and a gate into a single effect, so you can increase the overall dynamic level of an
audio signal, without distorting the loud parts, and without excessively boosting low-level noise. You can manually trigger the gate
via MIDI, which makes it simple to produce stuttering effects.
For more information, see the Stereo Compressor/Gate online Help.

HF Exciter
Figure 584. HF Exciter.

HF Exciter lets you enhance the higher end of the frequency spectrum. This produces the psycho-acoustic affect that the signal is
brighter and clearer. This is done by adding harmonic content that is not present in the original signal.
For more information, see the HF Exciter online Help.

Modfilter
Figure 585. Mod Filter.

Mod Filter produces a dynamic filtering effect, in that the actual filter can respond to incoming signal or follow the cycle of a temposynchronized LFO. The filter itself is a low-pass filter type, which filters out higher frequencies.

Sonitus fx: Compressor
Figure 589. Sonitus fx: Compressor.

fx:compressor is a variable-knee compressor with built-in peak limiting. The purpose of a compressor is to limit the dynamic range of
music or sound. Compression will make the loud parts of the signal more quiet, resulting in a more or less even level.
For more information, see the Sonitus fx: Compressor online Help.

Sonitus fx: Surround Compressor
Figure 590. Sonitus fx: Surround Compressor.

The Sonitus Surround Compressor is an enhanced, surround-capable version of the Sonitus:fx Compressor plug-in. The Surround
Compressor is comprised of four stereo compressors. After you patch the compressor into a surround bus, you can direct any
combination of the bus's input channels to any of the four compressors, sending any combination of stereo channel pairs, the center
channel, and the LFE to the compressor(s) you choose. By default, all channels feed into compressor 1, and you can then redirect
channels to the other three if you want.

fx:equalizer is a 6-band parametric equalizer with selectable filter types for each band and frequency response graph. Equalizers are
instrumental in fine tuning the frequency spectrum in all kinds of music and sound. They let you use different filtering techniques to
attenuate, cut or boost a specific frequency or a range of frequencies, allowing you the shape the overall characteristics of the audio
signal.

Sonitus fx: Gate
Figure 593. Sonitus fx: Gate.

fx:gate is a dynamic gate with side-chain filtering and lookahead. The fx:gate plug-in has wide variety of uses. It can function as a
noise gate, which quite simply gates (or blocks) signals whose amplitude lies below a certain threshold, and lets other signals
through. This is useful for eliminating background noises, such as hiss or hum, during periods of silence in a recording or
performance.
In addition, it also features a tunable peak Punch mode that makes it possible to add transient punch to frequencies lacking in
individual drum sounds, adding greater definition and presence to the gated signal. Using the variable high pass and low pass side
chain filters enables you to perform “frequency conscious” gating. The gate can also be switched from Gating to Ducking mode for
removal of clicks and pops.
For more information, see the Sonitus fx: Gate online Help.

Sonitus fx: Modulator

Sonitus fx: Multiband
Figure 595. Sonitus fx: Multiband.

fx:multiband is a 5 band variable knee compressor with both normal and vintage compression modes and output limiter.
Using a multiband compressor has many advantages over using a traditional (“single band”) compressor when it is used on audio
signals containing complex harmonic material like a complete music mix.

 “Pumping” is virtually eliminated. “Pumping” is a phenomenon that is noticed when music with a heavy bass beat is run through a
standard compressor; the mids and highs seem to vary in amplitude or “pump” to the beat. Multiband compressors don't pump
because the bass frequencies are processed in a different compressor from that used to process the mid- and high range
frequencies.

 The signal is equalized as it is compressed, so that differences in equalization between different sources are less noticeable.
 Multiband compressors suppress or enhance the dynamic properties of specific frequency ranges. Based on this, they can also
be used for tasks like de-essing, pop removal, adjusting vocal and/or instrument punch and breath (attack and release curves)
within a mix.
For more information, see the Sonitus fx: Multiband online Help.

Sonitus fx: Phase
Figure 596. Sonitus fx: Phase.

fx:phase lets you arbitrarily adjust the phase of a sound.
Note: fx:phase is a phase shifter or phase delay - it is not a phaser, which is an entirely different type of effect. A phaser creates
modulation effects by adjusting the center frequency of cascaded allpass filters, whereas fx:phase is used for applying a
constant phase shift at all frequencies.
For more information, see the Sonitus fx:Phase online Help.

Sonitus fx: Reverb
Figure 597. Sonitus fx: Reverb.

Reverb or reverberation is the effect of resounding echoes in a room or other enclosed acoustic environment. Reverb can be seen
as a series of echoes so dense that they can't be told apart from each other. fx:reverb emulates the phenomenon of sound being
reflected off walls in a virtual room, and allows you to add reverb that resembles the character, decay and frequency response of
various environments.
For more information, see the Sonitus fx: Reverb online Help.

Sonitus fx: Surround

Sonitus fx: WahWah
Figure 599. Sonitus fx: WahWah.

fx:wahwah is a guitar effect emulator. A classic guitar effect, the wahwah stomp box became an instant hit when it was introduced in
1966. The Vox wahwah was the first, and was soon followed by a multitude of similar designs. It was dubbed wahwah because of its
unique vocal-like sound. fx:wahwah is a digital adaptation of the analog designs, and is modeled after real-life wahwah stomp boxes
like the Morley Pro Series Distortion Wah, Jim Dunlop Crybaby Model GCB-95 and Model JH-1 (Jimi Hendrix).
For more information, see the Sonitus fx: Wah Wah online Help.

Process > Transpose
The Process > Transpose command transposes the pitches of note events up or down by a fixed number of half-steps. It does so
by changing the MIDI key numbers of note events and by pitch-shifting audio clips. Simply enter the number of half-steps in the
Amount field of the Transpose dialog box--a negative number to transpose down, a positive number to transpose up.
Cakewalk can also perform diatonic transposition, which shifts all the notes up and down the major scale of the current signature by
the designated number of steps. For instance, if you specify an amount of +1 and the key signature is C-major, a C becomes a D (up
a whole step), an E becomes an F (up a half step), and so on. Diatonic transposition assures you that the transposed notes fit with
the original key signature.
As an option, you can choose to transpose selected audio clips along with any selected MIDI clips. Cakewalk uses pitch-shifting to
perform the transposition. You can transpose audio only a single octave in either direction (-12 to +12), and you cannot transpose
audio when you are using diatonic transposition.

Process > Find/Change
The Process > Find/Change command is an extremely flexible way of manipulating the data parameters of events. It works
something like the search-and-replace function in a word processor but with scaling rather than simple replacement.
See:
“Searching for events” on page 881

Process > Length
The Process > Length command can be used to stretch or shrink a portion of a project. Process > Length lets you stretch or shrink
the selection by a fixed percentage and makes the adjustment by altering the individual events. A value of 200 percent, for example,
stretches the selection to twice its original length, while a value of 50 percent shrinks the selection to half its original length.
This command offers the option to stretch audio clips along with the MIDI information. Sometimes you don't want to adjust the speed
of your audio. Audio can be stretched or condensed up to a factor of 4 (e.g., it can be shrunk to as little as 25 percent of its original
length, or expanded to as much as 400 percent of its original length).
See also:
“Stretching and shrinking events” on page 866

Process > Scale Velocity
The Process > Scale Velocity command lets you create crescendos (volume swells) and decrescendos on those instruments that
respond to MIDI velocity. Most such instruments map changes in velocity to changes in note loudness. Many synthesizer patches
alter the timbre of the sound as well, so that higher velocities produce brighter, as well as louder, sounds. Changes in velocity also
affect the playback of audio clips.
This command lets you set a starting and ending velocity for the entire time range of the selection. Cakewalk scales the velocity of
each event to create a smooth linear change in velocity. As an option, you can enter a starting and ending percentage; existing
velocity values are modified by the designated percentage.
You can also edit note velocities in the Notes pane of the Piano Roll view, which lets you draw shapes other than straight line
changes. For more information, see “Adding and editing controllers in the Piano Roll” on page 843.

use this command, for example, to take a scale or other long run of notes and reverse the order in which they are played. The
Process > Retrograde command does not reverse the contents of audio clips. It only changes their start times. You can use the
Process > Apply Effect > Reverse command to reverse audio clips.

Process > Fit to Time
Process > Fit to Time stretches or shrinks the selection so that it ends at a specific time, expressed in either measure:beat:tick
(MBT) or hours:minutes:seconds:frames (SMPTE) format. This command gives you a choice of modifying the events or modifying
the underlying tempo. This is useful when you want to alter a portion of a project to have an exact length. The start time of the
selection does not change, but the end time is altered as necessary to fit the required time interval.
Audio can be stretched or condensed up to a factor of 4 (e.g., it can be shrunk to as little as 25 percent of its original length, or
expanded to as much as 400 percent of its original length).
For more information, see “To stretch or shrink to a specific length” on page 867 and “Stretching and shrinking events” on page 866.

Process > Fit Improvisation
Cakewalk lets you record music from a MIDI controller without requiring that you use a fixed tempo. But if you record without using a
metronome, you are very likely to end up with a recording that does not fit onto a fixed tempo grid.
The Process > Fit Improvisation command lets you take a recording and create a tempo map (with measure and beat boundaries)
that fits what you played. Your performance is not changed in any way, even thought the note start times and durations are adjusted
to fit the new tempo map.
To use this command, you must record a “reference track” containing a single clip that matches your original track or tracks, but has
only a single note on each beat boundary. You should make sure that the reference track has one event for every single beat, with
no extra beats or missing beats. The first beat of the reference track should be at 1:01:000. You can use any editing command to
adjust the reference track.

This command, which you find by right-clicking a fader, button, or knob in the Track or Console views, lets you adjust the start value
of a control. This command, together with the Set End = Current command, only functions when you use custom grouping. These
two commands set the range that a grouped control moves through when the members of its group move through their starting and
ending values. This makes it easy to group controls so that they move in similar or opposite motion and at similar or different rates of
speed.

The following rules apply when duplicating clips:

 Only events and clip automation are copied.
 The new clip(s) will be pasted immediately after the existing clip(s), respecting the current Ripple Edit settings.
 To respect the current Snap to Grid settings, go to Edit > Preferences > Customization - Editing and select Use Current Snap
Settings on Duplicate Selected Clip(s).

 After duplication, the Now time is forwarded to the end of the duplicate (with the duplicate selected), so you can press CTRL+D

 Unlike a normal paste, the current track will have no bearing on where the duplicates are pasted. Duplicates will always appear on
the same tracks/lanes as the source selection.

Tip: If you want to quickly create many repetitions, use the Edit > Copy and Edit > Paste Special commands.

Note: By default, regular Edit > Paste (or CTRL+V) does not remember the settings from the Paste Special dialog box, so you

[Sysx view] File > Open
Load a .syx file into the selected Sysx bank.

[Sysx view] File > Send
Transmit the current bank’s System Exclusive message. If nothing seems to happen, make sure you have correctly set the output.
This command is disabled if the current bank is empty.

[Sysx view] File > Send All
Transmit all non-empty Sysx banks.

[Sysx view] File > Receive
Dump data from a synthesizer into the selected Sysx bank. If the bank contains data, Cakewalk asks you whether you want the new
data to overwrite the existing data or be appended to it.
When receiving dumps, remember to connect both the MIDI In and Out ports of the synthesizer to the MIDI interface. Also, make
sure that your instruments are set up to receive and/or transmit Sysx. Synthesizers that you normally use only to play sounds—for
example, sound modules that don’t have keyboards—don’t need to be hooked up in both directions except for receiving dumps, so it
is easy to forget this. (If you will only be sending Sysx messages to the device, the normal one-direction hookup is sufficient.).

[Sysx view] File > Save
Save the selected Sysx bank as a .syx file. This is a good way to copy a Sysx bank between two Cakewalk project files. Save the
bank into a file, load the other Cakewalk project file, then load the bank again. This is also a good way to copy one bank to another
in the same project file.

[Sysx view] File > Clear
Delete the selected Sysx bank.

1580
[Lyrics view] Fonts > Fonts

[Sysx view] Edit > Edit Data
Although Cakewalk’s Sysx features are designed mainly to store System Exclusive data for you, you can edit the bytes of shorter
messages in hex format (many of the more popular synthesizers have special patch-editing programs available that let you edit data
using sliders and other tools rather than raw hex data).
When you select a bank and choose the Edit Data command, Cakewalk converts the binary data into a text representation and pops
up the Edit System Exclusive Bytes dialog box, in which you can edit the text. If you make changes and click OK to keep them,
Cakewalk tries to convert the text back into binary format. You’ll get an error message if the text does not begin with an F0 and end
with an F7, which are the System Exclusive begin and end bytes.
Cakewalk may not be able to convert the data to text format. The text representation requires three to four times more memory than
the data itself, and the Edit System Exclusive Bytes dialog box can contain roughly as much text as Notepad.

[Sysx view] Edit > Name
Enter a descriptive name for the selected Sysx bank. Names are saved only in .cwp and .cwb files.

[Sysx view] Settings > Auto Send on/off
Automatically transmit the selected bank every time Cakewalk loads the project file. You might use this option for banks that contain
System Exclusive messages that load a set of sounds for a synthesizer at or before the start of a project.
Before transmitting, Cakewalk asks your permission. This is a safety feature for loading a file you have received from someone else;
if it happens to contain data for your synthesizer(s), you might lose your patches and configuration information. However, if you don’t
want to be asked, go to Edit > Preferences > File - Advanced and clear the Ask Before Sending System Exclusive (When
Opening Projects) check box.

[Sysx view] Settings > Output
Specify the MIDI output port to transmit the selected Sysx bank on.

When you use the Help > About Cakewalk command, the About Box appears, showing the version number of your Cakewalk
product and membership status.

Apply Audio Effects dialog
This dialog box gives you several options when applying audio effects:
Delete the effects from the track FX Rack. This option lets you either keep your effects patched in the selected track(s) after the
effects have been applied, or delete the effect from the track(s).
Render in Real-time. This option is normally disabled but should be enabled if the track you are bouncing contains the External
Insert plug-in (see “External Insert plug-in” on page 1022). If you bounce audio that uses the External Insert plug-in, the bounce
operation must be performed in real-time.
Audible Bounce. The Audible Bounce option is only available when Render in Real-time is enabled. When Audible Bounce is
unchecked, no audio output will be heard during the bounce process. When Render in Real-time and Audible Bounce are both
enabled, you can hear the output of the mixdown.
Caution: Depending on the gainstages used in the project and the mixdown options selected–such as bouncing with Source
Category assigned to Tracks, or with mute/solo or automation disabled under Mix and Render, –the output may be louder or
softer than during normal playback. Please be sure to turn down the master output level before using real-time audible bounce
under these scenarios to avoid the possibility of speaker damage.

Audio CD Burner dialog
The Utilities > Burn Audio CD command opens the Audio CD Burner dialog box. Use this command to burn your tracks to an
audio CD. Tracks must meet the following criteria:

 All audio tracks must be stereo Wave files (extension .wav).
 Sample rate must be 44,100 Hz.
 Bit depth must be 16.
The Audio CD Burner dialog box has the following controls:

 Track List. The main area of the window is the track list. The tracks comprise the sounds that will be written (burned) to an
audio CD. Each track is contained on its own line.

 Add Track. Browse to your local file system and add a new track to the list. All Audio Tracks must be stereo .wav files with a
sample rate of 44,100 Hz, and a bit depth of 16. New tracks will go at the end of the list but can be moved anywhere. After a track
is added, its size is added to the Space Used field, and subtracted from the Space Available field.

 Move Up / Down. Move the selected item(s) up or down in the track list order.
 Delete Track. Remove a track from the list.
 Target Drive. The Target Drive specifies the CD writing device to be used. The program scans your system to locate all
available CD writing devices. Click on the arrow next to the drive letter to refresh the Target Drive. This process will verify if a
blank CD has been placed in the drive. Once the blank CD has been verified, the available CD capacity is listed below the Track
List.

 Burn CD. Verifies, performs a layout of the tracks and writes the current track list to CD medium in the selected drive. After the
disk is completed, the disk is ejected from the drive.

 Test Burn. Verifies, performs a layout of the tracks and simulates burning the current track list to CD.
 Cancel Burn. This button appears when either Burn CD or Test Burn has been selected. It causes the current operation to be
aborted.

Audio Mixdown Options dialog
Clicking the Mixdown Options button in the Export Video dialog box opens the Audio Mixdown Options dialog box. This dialog
box lets you control the characteristics of the audio file you export when you export a video from Cakewalk.
This dialog box has the following fields:

 Preset. You can name and save a preset which includes the source bus and all mix enable selections.
 Channel Format. Choose Mono, Stereo, or Multichannel.
 Sample Rate. Choose the sample rate that you want your exported audio to use.
 Bit Depth. Choose the bit depth that you want your exported audio to use.
 Dithering. Choose between five available types of dithering.
 Source Bus(es). Choose the bus or sound card driver you want to use to export your audio file.
 Mix Enables. Choose all the different audio components you want to include in your exported audio file. You usually include
everything. If you include either Track FX or Bus FX, it’s a good idea to add an extra measure to the end of your project to contain
any reverb tails that your effects produce. Unchecking Render in Real-time causes the audio export process to go as fast as
possible, as opposed to exporting in real-time. The Audible Bounce option is only available when Render in Real-time is
enabled. When Audible Bounce is unchecked, no audio output will be heard during the bounce process. When Render in Realtime and Audible Bounce are both enabled, you can hear the output of the mixdown.
Caution: Depending on the gainstages used in the project and the mixdown options selected–such as with mute/solo or
automation disabled under Mix Enables, –the output may be louder or softer than during normal playback. Please be sure to
turn down the master output level before using real-time audible bounce under these scenarios to avoid the possibility of
speaker damage.

AVI Encoder Options dialog
Clicking the Encoding Options button in the Video dialog box opens the AVI Encoder Options dialog box. This dialog box lists the
AVI video and audio codecs (compression-decompression programs) that are currently installed on your computer. The AVI
Encoder Options dialog box has the following fields:

Video Codec
Choose a compression format, but note the following:

 Not all compression codecs listed may necessarily be compatible while re-compressing video through “Export to AVI”. If an
incompatible compression codec is selected an error message may be displayed during the export.

 If No Compression is selected, the video retains its original compression.
 The following video compression codecs have been found to be compatible. Different codecs provide varying degrees of
compression performance.

 MJPEG Compressor
 DV Video Encoder
 Indeo Video 5.04
 Intel I.263
 Cinepak Codec by Radius
 Microsoft Video 1

Audio Codec

Note: If you’re exporting an AVI file to either a 24-bit audio format or to a multi-channel (surround sound) format, set the Audio
Codec to No Compression.
The following audio compression codecs have been found to be compatible (you may see different codecs installed on your system):

 CCITT - A Law
 CCITT - U Law
 DSP Group TrueSpeech
 PCM (this is the standard uncompressed format for wav files)
 GSM 6.10
 IMA ADPCM
Keyframe Rate
This field is grayed-out if you choose the Default Codec in the Video field.
Note: If you intend to do a lot of seeking around or looping and editing while a video file is loaded, make sure that your video
file has sufficient keyframes. Since each frame has to be computed from the last keyframe encountered, if you have very few
keyframes in the video, performance may be slow. To change the number of keyframes, you may recompress the file using
File > Export > Video and specify more frequent keyframes. Choose a suitable video compressor such as “Indeo Video 5.04"
and change the KeyFrame Rate parameter to a number between 1-5. A value of 1 makes every frame a keyframe, and higher
numbers insert a keyframe after that many frames.

Data Rate
This field is grayed-out if you choose the Default Codec in the Video field. If you are compressing a file to be played over the
internet, use a data rate that doesn’t exceed the capacity of the media players you expect will be used to play your file.

Quality
Lower quality values provide faster transmission and vice versa.

Change AVI settings
Checking this box causes another dialog box to appear after you click the Save button. This is the Properties dialog box that allows
you finer control over the configuration of the AVI file you are creating. The available parameters are Microsoft Direct Show
settings.

Bank Name dialog
When you select a bank in the Sysx view and click the Name button, the Bank Name dialog box appears. This dialog box lets you

Bounce to Track(s) dialog
Click the Track view Tracks menu and choose Bounce to Track(s) to open the Bounce to Track(s) dialog box.
This command lets you process the effects and/or automation together with the audio data in tracks to create one or several new
tracks in order to lighten the load on your computer. Once you’ve bounced the tracks, you can backup or delete the source tracks to
free up your computer’s resources.
Note 1: If you select any data in your project, only that data is included when you choose to bounce tracks. Alternatively, you
can mute tracks you don’t want to include in the mixdown, and then check Track Mute/Solo under Mix and Render so that
Cakewalk uses that information as a guide when picking what tracks to include in the bounce. If a project is using any effects
that add a “tail” to the end of an audio track, such as reverb or delay, then you should make sure that you select extra time in
the Time Ruler (duration needed to hear the tail) at the end of the current selection before using the Tracks > Bounce to
Track(s) command. This ensures that the “tail” is included in the audio mixdown.

Note 2: You control the bit depth of all rendering operations (bouncing, freezing, applying effects) in Edit > Preferences > File
- Audio Data in the Render Bit Depth field. The default value for render bit depth is 32. 64 can be selected to preserve the
greater mixing and rendering precision that the 64 bit double precision mix engine provides. Values of 16 and 24 can also be
selected. See “Bit depths for rendering audio” on page 1361 for more information.
The dialog box has the following fields:

Preset
 Preset. You can create presets of bounce/export settings.
 To recall a preset, select it from the drop-down menu.
 To save a preset, give your preset a new name, then press ENTER or click the Create Preset button

.

 To update an existing preset, select the preset and make the required changes, then click the Create Preset button
 To delete the selected preset, click the Delete Preset button

.

.

A preset stores the following settings:

 Format settings (except Bounce Buffer Size)
 What to Bounce source category
 Mix and Render settings
Destination
Assign the track to which you want to mixdown. If you are creating more than one track of audio, the destination track must be the
first of consecutive blank or unwanted tracks.

1596

Dialog box reference
Bounce to Track(s) dialog

Format
 Channel Format. Specify whether to create stereo or mono tracks. Select from one of the following options:
 Mono. Creates a separate mono track for each track or bus selected in the Sources list.
 Stereo. Creates a separate stereo track for each track or bus selected in the Sources list.
 Split Mono. Creates separate mono track for each track or bus selected in the Sources list. Stereo tracks/buses are split
into separate tracks for the left and right channels. If the selected bus is a surround bus, the selected bus produces as many
mono tracks as the bus has channels.

 Dithering. Choose which dithering algorithm to use when bouncing. Whenever an audio signal is converted from a higher-bit
resolution to a lower resolution, it is necessary to apply dither to avoid introducing undesirable quantization noise or harmonic
distortion into the signal. For more information see “Dithering” on page 1136. Cakewalk offers five kinds of dithering:

 None. No dithering is applied.
 Rectangular. Essentially white noise, no noise shaping. Advantages: least CPU-intensive, lowest signal-to-noise ratio,
preferable to shaped dither when successive dithering can occur (e.g. bouncing, freezing). Disadvantages: suffers from
intermodulation distortion, higher perceived loudness than Pow-r dither.

 Triangular. Higher level than rectangular, no noise shaping. Advantages: low CPU-intensive dither, superior to Rectangular
as it does not suffer from modulation noise effects. Preferable to shaped (Pow-r) dither when successive dithering can occur
(e.g. bouncing, freezing). Disadvantages: higher perceived loudness than Pow-r dither.

 Pow-r 1. Noise-shaped dither. Advantages: less CPU-intensive than Pow-r types 2 and 3, lower perceived loudness than
Rectangular or Triangular. Disadvantages: less noise shaping than Pow-r types 2 and 3, not recommended for operations
where dither will be applied successively (e.g. bounce and freeze).

 Pow-r 2. Noise-shaped dither. Advantages: lowest perceived loudness, highest quality settings, recommended for audio
export. Disadvantages: highest CPU-intensive settings, not recommended for operations where dither will be applied
successively (e.g. bounce and freeze).

 Pow-r 3. Same as Pow-r 2 except most CPU-intensive and transparent of all choices.
 Bounce Buffer Size (ms). Controls the buffer size for mixdown independently of the playback latency buffer size when Render
in Real-time is disabled. The default settings uses the current playback buffer size (max size is 200 msec). A larger buffer size
can speed up the mixdown process in large projects by allowing the CPU to process data more efficiently, but will use more
memory. The playback latency buffer size is used when Render in Real-time is enabled.

Dialog box reference
Bounce to Track(s) dialog

1597

What to Bounce
 Source Category. Specify which audio sources to bounce:
 Tracks. Creates a separate track (or group of tracks if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each track that
you select in the Sources list. The audio is captured at each of the selected track outputs, before it reaches any buses.
Note: When the Source Category is Tracks, the project selection has a special meaning:
• Having a project selection means that there is a time selection. If tracks are selected in the project, then all the tracks
selected in the Sources list will be bounced at exactly the length of the selection. All bounced tracks will be the same
duration.
• If there is no selection, then no specific mixdown time range has been set, and the duration will be the length of each
individual track.

 Buses. Creates a separate track (or group of tracks if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each bus that you
select in the Sources list. The audio is captured at each of the selected bus outputs.

 Hardware Outputs. Creates a separate track (or group of tracks if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each
hardware output that you select in the Sources list. The audio is captured at each of the selected hardware outputs.

 Entire Mix. Creates a single track (or group of tracks if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) as heard through
the main output.

 Sources. Select the audio source(s) that you want to bounce, based on the Source Category.
Note: Selection within the Sources list is there only to help you check or uncheck multiple items at once. It has no bearing on
what will be bounced. Only the checked source items will be bounced.
• To quickly select all/none in the Sources list, hold down CTRL+SHIFT and click any checkbox.
• To select all, press CTRL+A.
• To check/uncheck the selected sources, press SPACEBAR.

 Search. The search filter lets you search for a particular source should you have a large number of sources to search through.
The search filter is available for all source categories except Hardware Outputs, Entire Mix, and Clips.

 Show/Hide Project Selection

/

. Show/hide the current project selection.

 Tracks/Buses in Project. Mixdown works on the current project selection. The Tracks/Buses in Project list allows you to
modify the current track selection and the mute and solo status of each track and bus, without exiting the Bounce to
Tracks(s) dialog box. Note:
• A track that is checked means it is included in the selection. If all tracks are unchecked, it means there is no selection, and
all tracks are available.
• Changing the project selection changes which Sources items are available.

Mix and Render
When all Mix and Render options are selected, the mixdown will sound the same as playback. You can check or uncheck each of
the following items to include or exclude them from the mix:

 Track Mute/Solo. When enabled, tracks that are currently muted are not mixed down, and if any tracks are soloed, only those
tracks are included in the mixdown.

 Track Automation. Include track automation in the mixdown, When disabled, any volume and pan automation, including
initial volume and pan settings, is ignored when creating the new track(s). The amplitude of the raw data in the tracks is used,
and the pan is C, or centered.

 Track FX. Include track effects in the mixdown. When disabled, any effects patched into various tracks’ patch points, including
any plug-in synthesizers patched into track fx patch points, are ignored when creating the new track(s).

 Bus Mute/Solo. When enabled, buses that are currently muted are not mixed down, and if any buses are soloed, only those
buses are included in the mixdown.

 Bus Automation. Include bus automation in the mixdown, When disabled, any bus automation is ignored when creating the
new track(s).

1598

Dialog box reference
Bounce to Track(s) dialog

 Bus FX. Include bus effects in the mixdown. When disabled, any effects patched into buses, including any plug-in
synthesizers patched into bus fx patch points, are ignored when creating the new track(s).

 Clip Automation. Include clip automation in the mixdown, When disabled, any clip automation, including any trim settings, is
ignored when creating the new track(s).

 Synth/FX Automation. Include synth/FX automation in the mixdown, When disabled, any synth and effect automation is
ignored when creating the new track(s).

 64-bit Engine. Enable the 64-bit mix engine temporarily during mixdown if you don’t have 64-bit Double Precision Engine
selected in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings. This produces a higher-quality mixdown without taxing your CPU
during the rest of your session. Disable if you use plug-ins that do not support 64-bit processing.

 Render in Real-time. When enabled, mixdown is performed in real-time by actually playing back the project in similar fashion to
standard playback. All audio hardware inputs and outputs are active in order to allow I/O to external hardware inserts. Enable if
you use effects or synths that only work in real-time. When disabled, all hardware outputs are temporarily disabled and the
mixdown is performed silently as fast as your computer allows. There is no sonic degradation by performing a fast mixdown since
it uses the same operation that is performed during normal playback.
Note: You must enable Render in Real-time if you use the External Insert plug-in. Since the External Insert plug-in is typically
used to receive audio from external hardware, Cakewalk’s audio output must be sent to the external hardware in real-time.
Certain software instruments, such as samplers, cannot process audio faster than real-time and will produce glitches when operated
faster than real-time.
Some hardware-based DSP effects have trouble with faster than real-time mixdown.

 Audible Bounce. When Render in Real-time is enabled, the real-time render operation can be performed either silently or
audibly. When Audible Bounce is enabled, you can hear the output of the mixdown. When disabled, no audio output will be
heard during the mixdown process.
Caution: Depending on the gainstages used in the project and the mixdown options selected–such as bouncing with Source
Category assigned to Tracks, or with mute/solo or automation disabled under Mix and Render, –the output may be louder or
softer than during normal playback. Please be sure to turn down the master output level before using real-time audible bounce
under these scenarios to avoid the possibility of speaker damage.

 Live Input. When Render in Real-time is enabled, enable Live Input to include any live audio input in the mixdown. For
details, see “Real-time bounce” on page 1050.

Range
 Range. Specify the time range to be bounced:
 Entire Project. The entire length of the project.
 Time Selection. A specified time selection. The Start and End edit boxes allow you to manually enter the start and end
times of the bounce range. Click the

/

button to toggle between musical (Measures:Beats:Ticks)

and absolute

time. Click the
buttons to choose a time based on defined project landmarks, such
as the beginning of the project, the now time, or marker locations.
• Set Time Selection to Loop Range. Set the selection start and end times to the Loop From and Loop Thru times.
• Set Time Selection to Punch Range. Set the selection start and end times to the Punch In and Punch Out times.

Export Audio dialog
Select File > Export > Audio to open the Export Audio dialog box. This command lets you export your projects as Wave, MP3
files, and other types of formats.
Note: If you select any data in your project, only that data is included when you choose to export audio. Alternatively, you can
mute tracks or buses you don’t want to include in the mixdown, and then check Track Mute/Solo or Bus Mute/Solo in the Mix
and Render section so that Cakewalk uses that information as a guide when picking what data to include in the exported file.
If a project is using any effects that add a “tail” to the end of an audio track, such as reverb or delay, then you should make sure
that you select extra time in the Time Ruler at the end of the current selection before using the File > Export Audio command.
This ensures that the “tail” is included in the audio mixdown.

 RF64. The RIFF 64 format, with the file extension .rf64.
 SD2. The Sound Designer II format, with the file extension .sd2.
 W64. The SonicFoundry WAVE 64 format, with the file extension .w64.
 WAV. [uses Libsndfile wave exporter] The standard digital audio format used under Windows and for CD’s, with a file
extension of .wav.

 WAVEX. The Wave Format Extensible format, with the file extension .wav.
 YouTube Publish. Share a CD quality version of your song on YouTube. This format will result in a larger file size and may
take longer to upload.

 Channel Format. Specify whether to export stereo files, mono files or split mono files. Select from one of the following options:
 Follow Source. Create stereo files for stereo tracks, or mono files for mono tracks.
 Mono. Creates a separate mono file for each track or bus selected in the Sources list.
 Stereo. Creates a separate stereo file for each track or bus selected in the Sources list.
 Split Mono. Creates separate mono files for each track or bus selected in the Sources list. Stereo tracks/buses are split into
separate files for the left and right channels. If the selected bus is a surround bus, the selected bus produces as many mono
files as the bus has channels.

 Multichannel. All exported tracks in a Surround project are mixed down to a multichannel file containing the number of
channels listed in Edit > Preferences > Project - Surround.

 Sample Rate. Set the sample rate for the file(s).
 Bit Depth. Set the bit depth for the file(s).
Tip: If you are exporting to a file with a different bit depth from the one in your project, enable Dithering to prevent undesirable
quantization noise or harmonic distortion.

 Decimation Filter (DSD format only). The decimation filter produces improved sound quality with DSD export, and is only
available when exporting to a DSD format. The filter supports four decimation modes:
• 90% of Nyquist
• Nyquist Frequency
• Large order FIR
• FFT FIR
Each successive option gives higher quality conversion than the previous one, but may take longer to process.

 Dithering. Choose which dithering algorithm to use when exporting to a file with a different bit depth from the one in your
project. Whenever an audio signal is converted from a higher-bit resolution to a lower resolution, it is necessary to apply dither to
avoid introducing undesirable quantization noise or harmonic distortion into the signal. For more information see “Dithering” on
page 1136. Cakewalk offers five kinds of dithering:

 None. No dithering is applied.
 Rectangular. Essentially white noise, no noise shaping. Advantages: least CPU-intensive, lowest signal-to-noise ratio,
preferable to shaped dither when successive dithering can occur (e.g. bouncing, freezing). Disadvantages: suffers from
intermodulation distortion, higher perceived loudness than Pow-r dither.

 Triangular. Higher level than rectangular, no noise shaping. Advantages: low CPU-intensive dither, superior to Rectangular
as it does not suffer from modulation noise effects. Preferable to shaped (Pow-r) dither when successive dithering can occur
(e.g. bouncing, freezing). Disadvantages: higher perceived loudness than Pow-r dither.

 Pow-r 1. Noise-shaped dither. Advantages: less CPU-intensive than Pow-r types 2 and 3, lower perceived loudness than
Rectangular or Triangular. Disadvantages: less noise shaping than Pow-r types 2 and 3, not recommended for operations
where dither will be applied successively (e.g. bounce and freeze).

 Pow-r 2. Noise-shaped dither. Advantages: lowest perceived loudness, highest quality settings, recommended for audio
export. Disadvantages: highest CPU-intensive settings, not recommended for operations where dither will be applied
successively (e.g. bounce and freeze).

 Pow-r 3. Same as Pow-r 2 except most CPU-intensive and transparent of all choices.

 Bounce Buffer Size (ms). Controls the buffer size for export independently of the playback latency buffer size when Render in
Real-time is disabled. The default settings uses the current playback buffer size (max size is 200 msec). A larger buffer size can
speed up the export process in large projects by allowing the CPU to process data more efficiently, but will use more memory. The
playback latency buffer size is used when Render in Real-time is enabled.

What to export
 Source Category. Specify which audio sources to export:
 Tracks. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each track that you
select in the Sources list. The audio is captured at each of the selected track outputs, before it reaches any buses.
Note: When the Source Category is Tracks, the project selection has a special meaning:
• Having a project selection means that there is a time selection. If tracks are selected in the project, then all the tracks
selected in the Sources list will be exported at exactly the length of the selection. All exported files will be the same duration.
• If there is no selection, then no specific export time range has been set, and the duration of each tracks’ audio file will be the
length of each individual track.

 Tracks Through Entire Mix.

Exports individual tracks, including all downstream bus effects and automation, as heard
through the main output. The result is the same as if you solo one track at a time during export.

 Track Folders. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each track
folder that you select in the Sources list, as heard through the main output. The result is the same as if you solo one track
folder at a time during export.

 Buses. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each bus that you
select in the Sources list. The audio is captured at each of the selected bus outputs.

 Hardware Outputs. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each
hardware output that you select in the Sources list. The audio is captured at each of the selected hardware outputs.

 Entire Mix. Creates a single file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) as heard through the
main output.

 Clips. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each clip in the current
project selection.

 Mix Recall. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each Mix Recall
scene that you select in the Sources list, as heard through the main output.

 Arrangements. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each
arrangement that you select in the Sources list.

 Arranger Sections. Creates a separate file (or group of files if Split Mono is selected under Channel Format) for each
Arranger section that you select in the Sources list, as heard through the main output.

 Sources. Select the audio source(s) that you want to export, based on the Source Category.
Note: Selection within the Sources list is there only to help you check or uncheck multiple items at once. It has no bearing on
what will be exported. Only the checked source items will be exported.
• To quickly select all/none in the Sources list, hold down CTRL+SHIFT and click any checkbox.
• To select all, press CTRL+A.
• To check/uncheck the selected sources, press SPACEBAR.

 Search. The search filter lets you search for a particular source should you have a large number of sources to search through.
The search filter is available for all source categories except Hardware Outputs, Entire Mix, and Clips.

 Show/Hide Project Selection

/

. Show/hide the current project selection.

 Tracks/Buses in Project. Export works on the current project selection. The Tracks/Buses in Project list allows you to
modify the current track selection and the mute and solo status of each track and bus, without exiting the Export Audio dialog
box. This is especially convenient if you if you want to create several tasks, each with a different selection, or if you want to
export multiple stems. Simply solo the tracks that you want to include in the stem, then add as a new task. Note:
• A track that is checked means it is included in the selection. If all tracks are unchecked, it means there is no selection, and
all tracks are available.
• Changing the project selection changes which Sources items are available.

Mix and render
When all Mix and Render options are selected, the export will sound the same as playback. You can check or uncheck each of the
following items to include or exclude them from the exported audio file(s):

 Track Mute/Solo. When enabled, tracks that are currently muted are not mixed down, and if any tracks are soloed, only those
tracks are included in the mixdown.

 Track Automation. Include track automation in the mixdown, When disabled, any volume and pan automation, including
initial volume and pan settings, is ignored when creating the new file(s). The amplitude of the raw data in the tracks is used,
and the pan is C, or centered.

 Track FX. Include track effects in the mixdown. When disabled, any effects patched into various tracks’ patch points, including
any plug-in synthesizers patched into track fx patch points, are ignored when creating the new file(s).

 Bus Mute/Solo. When enabled, buses that are currently muted are not mixed down, and if any buses are soloed, only those
buses are included in the mixdown.

 Bus Automation. Include bus automation in the mixdown, When disabled, any bus automation is ignored when creating the
new file(s).

 Bus FX. Include bus effects in the mixdown. When disabled, any effects patched into buses, including any plug-in
synthesizers patched into bus fx patch points, are ignored when creating the new file(s).

 Clip Automation. Include clip automation in the mixdown, When disabled, any clip automation, including any trim settings, is
ignored when creating the new file(s).

 Synth/FX Automation. Include synth/FX automation in the mixdown, When disabled, any synth and effect automation is
ignored when creating the new file(s).

 64-bit Engine. Enable the 64-bit mix engine temporarily during mixdown if you don’t have 64-bit Double Precision Engine
selected in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Driver Settings. This produces a higher-quality mixdown without taxing your CPU
during the rest of your session. Disable if you use plug-ins that do not support 64-bit processing.

 Render in Real-time. When enabled, mixdown is performed in real-time by actually playing back the project in similar fashion to
standard playback. All audio hardware inputs and outputs are active in order to allow I/O to external hardware inserts. Enable if
you use effects or synths that only work in real-time. When disabled, all hardware outputs are temporarily disabled and the
mixdown is performed silently as fast as your computer allows. There is no sonic degradation by performing a fast mixdown since
it uses the same operation that is performed during normal playback.
Note: You must enable Render in Real-time if you use the External Insert plug-in. Since the External Insert plug-in is typically
used to receive audio from external hardware, Cakewalk’s audio output must be sent to the external hardware in real-time.
Certain software instruments, such as samplers, cannot process audio faster than real-time and will produce glitches when operated
faster than real-time.
Some hardware-based DSP effects have trouble with faster than real-time mixdown.

 Audible Bounce. When Render in Real-time is enabled, the real-time render operation can be performed either silently or
audibly. When Audible Bounce is enabled, you can hear the output of the mixdown. When disabled, no audio output will be
heard during the mixdown process.
Caution: Depending on the gainstages used in the project and the mixdown options selected–such as bouncing with Source
Category assigned to Tracks, or with mute/solo or automation disabled under Mix and Render, –the output may be louder or
softer than during normal playback. Please be sure to turn down the master output level before using real-time audible bounce
under these scenarios to avoid the possibility of speaker damage.

 Live Input. When Render in Real-time is enabled, enable Live Input to include any live audio input in the mixdown, such
as external hardware synths or effects. For details, see “Real-time bounce” on page 1050.

The Process > Fit to Time command opens the Fit to Time dialog box, which you can use to stretch or shrink a selection so that it
ends at a specific time, expressed in either measure:beat:tick (MBT) or hours:minutes:seconds:frames (SMPTE) format. This
command gives you a choice of modifying the events or modifying the underlying tempo. This is useful when you want to alter a
portion of a project to have an exact length. The start time of the selection does not change, but the end time is altered as necessary
to fit the required time interval.
Audio can be stretched or condensed up to a factor of 4 (e.g., it can be shrunk to as little as 25 percent of its original length, or
expanded to as much as 400 percent of its original length).
The Fit to Time dialog box has the following fields:

Freeze Options dialog
The Freeze Options dialog box has the following options:

Render n Real-time
When disabled, Cakewalk bounces to tracks as fast as your computer will allow. If enabled, bouncing to tracks happens in real time.
Enable this option if you are using a synth that only works in real time.

Hide MIDI Tracks
Check this box if you want the MIDI tracks associated with your synth to be hidden when the synth is frozen.

Single Bounce Per Track
Check this if you want to create a single clip for all the bounced audio. If you don’t check this, each separate clip on a track creates
a separate clip when you freeze the track.

Remove Silence
If you checked the previous option, you can check this box and adjust settings in the Remove Silence dialog box to remove silence
in a frozen track. Checking this option will create separate clips from a single clip that has areas of silence in it.

Freeze Tail Duration n seconds
This value allows for a reverb or delay tail (the reverberations or signal delay that continue once the source has stopped). Set this
value at a high enough value to allow for any delay or reverb or other effect that you may have patched into a track.

Audible Bounce
When Render in Real-time is enabled, the real-time bounce operation can be performed either silently or audibly. To hear the
bounce operation while freezing a track, select the Audible Bounce check box.

Track FX
When selected (default behavior), the track FX Rack is rendered into the frozen clip, Freeze Tail Duration is applied, and the track
FX Rack is bypassed.
If the Track FX option is not selected, the track FX Rack is not rendered into the frozen clip, which is useful when freezing
AudioSnap clips in order to conserve CPU resources.
Tip: You can right-click any track’s Freeze button in the Track view to open the Freeze Options dialog box.

box has some options:

Create These Tracks:
 Simple Instrument Track. If you select this option, the synth’s MIDI input and main audio output appear in a single track strip.
 Instrument Track Per Output. This option pairs a MIDI track with a separate audio output track (mono or stereo) for each synth
output, assigning sequential MIDI channels. This allows you to have multiple Instrument tracks for a single instance of a synth.

 Stereo Audio Outputs. Create one new stereo Instrument track for each stereo audio output of the synth.
 Mono Audio Outputs. Create two new mono Instrument tracks (one Left and one Right) for each stereo audio output of the
synth.

 MIDI Source. If you select this option, a new MIDI track appears that lists the particular soft synth you chose in the MIDI track’s
Output field. You still need to choose values in the MIDI track’s Patch and possibly Channel menus.

 Synth Track Folder. If you select this option, new synth tracks and associated MIDI tracks appear in a track folder. Each new
instance of a synth gets its own folder.

 First Synth Audio Output. If you select this option, a new synth track appears that uses the synth’s first audio output as an
audio input.

 All Synth Audio Outputs: Stereo. If you select this option, one new stereo synth track appears for each stereo audio output
that the synth you chose has. Each of the new tracks uses a different one of the synth’s outputs as an audio input.

 All Synth Audio Outputs: Mono. If you select this option, two new mono synth tracks (one Left and one Right) appear for each
stereo audio output that the synth you chose has. Each pair of new synth tracks uses a different one of the synth’s outputs as an
audio input.

Open These Windows:
 Synth Property Page. If you choose this option, the interface (property page) of the synth you’re inserting appears when you
insert it.

 Synth Rack view. If you choose this option, the Synth Rack view appears each time you insert another synth (or another
instance of a synth you’ve already inserted).

Number of Tracks / Track Pairs to Create
When inserting a multi-timbral soft synth, you can specify how many Instrument output tracks to create.

 Limit to <n>. Specify how many Instrument output tracks to create (from 1 to the maximum supported by the synth).
 Max Available. Create one Instrument output track for each available synth output.

Tip: If you create less than the maximum available output tracks, you can later add additional tracks from the Synth Rack view (Views >
Synth Rack View). To do so, right-click the synth in the Synth Rack and select Append Instrument Track.

Enable MIDI Output
Some synths can create MIDI data from built-in arpeggiators or other components. If you want to record or redirect this new MIDI
data, enable this check box.

Find/Change and Event Filter dialog
The Process > Find/Change command is a search-and-replace command that uses two dialog boxes. The command itself opens
the Event Filter-Search dialog box. In this dialog box, you fill in the kinds of events you want Cakewalk to find and select. When
you click OK, the Event Filter-Replace dialog box appears. In this dialog box, you fill in the kind of events you want to replace the
selected events with.
To see some examples of how to fill in the dialog boxes, see “Process > Find/Change” on page 884.
For an explanation of all the fields in the Event Filter dialog box, see “Event Filter Select Some/Search/Replace dialog” on page
1612.

Kind of Event dialog
In the Event List view, double-clicking the name of any event that’s listed in the Kind column opens the Kind of Event dialog box.
After you double-click the name of an event, you can change that event into another kind of event by choosing the new kind of event
in the Kind of Event dialog box.

Length dialog
The Process > Length command, which opens the Length dialog box, can be used to stretch or shrink MIDI and/or audio clips,
and/or to move their start times. Process > Length lets you stretch or shrink the selection by a fixed percentage and makes the
adjustment by altering the individual events. A value of 200 percent, for example, stretches the selection to twice its original length,
while a value of 50 percent shrinks the selection to half its original length.
This command offers the option to stretch audio clips along with the MIDI information. Sometimes you don't want to adjust the speed
of your audio. Audio can be stretched or condensed up to a factor of 4 (e.g., it can be shrunk to as little as 25 percent of its original
length, or expanded to as much as 400 percent of its original length).
You can also use the Process > Length command to alter only the start times or the durations of notes. For example, changing the
durations of notes to 50 percent of their original length can create a staccato effect.
The Length dialog box has the following fields:

Change
Use the fields in this section to tell Cakewalk what to change, including:

 Start Times. Choose this option if you want the start times of the selected events to shift by a percentage of their distance from
the beginning of the selection. For example, if a note starts on beat 3 of a selection and you enter a value of 50 percent, Cakewalk
shifts the start of the note one beat to the left, or half of 2 beats.

 Durations. Choose this option if you want the durations of the selected events to shrink by a percentage.
By “N” Percent
Fill in the percentage number that you want the selected events to change by, which can be positive or negative.

Stretch Audio
Choose this option if you want duration of any selected audio to change.

Type (disabled unless Stretch Audio is checked)
Choose options based on the source material: single voice or instrument versus a group of instruments (ensemble or polyphonic),
and how long you want to wait for processing to finish: better quality can take a long time if you’re processing several tracks.

1650
MIDI Input Presets dialog

MP3 Export Options dialog
The following is a description of the options in the MP3 Export Options dialog:

Bit Rate
Choose a bit rate from the drop-down list. A higher bit rate creates larger, higher quality files. The Bit Rate allows you to select the
trade-off between the size and the sound quality of the compressed file. Compressing to higher bit rates will provide better sound
quality, but will also create larger files.
Bit rate is specified in bits per second. As a rule of thumb, bit rates of 120,000 bits per second or higher offer near CD quality sound.
Lower bit rates can be used, with a corresponding decrease in quality. If you are preparing your project for distribution on the web,
lower bit rates will create smaller files, and therefore faster downloading time.
The maximum bit rate that you can select depends on the sampling rate of the project. The encoder supports bit rates up to 320000
bit per second, providing extremely high quality compression. Selection of 320000 bits per second or lower requires that your project
was created using at least a 32 kHz sampling rate. If your project was created using a lower sampling rate, your selection of bit rates
will also be limited.

Stereo Mode
Select one of the following from the drop-down list:

 Joint Stereo. In Joint Stereo mode, the encoder optimizes the stereo encoding by comparing the two stereo channels. If
similar information is found in the left and right channels, the encoder uses the similar information to minimize the data it
stores in the MP3 file. While this encoding technique may result in better compression, it may result in a loss of stereo quality.
An additional option when using Joint Stereo compression is the selection of Intensity Stereo. Selection of Intensity Stereo
instructs the encoder to further optimize the encoding by minimizing the data encoded for higher frequency sounds. This can
also improve the compression of the MP3 file, however in some cases the optimization of high frequency sounds may result in
a loss of sound quality.

 Mono. Create a Mono file
 Stereo. By selecting Stereo mode, the encoder will create a Stereo MP3 file from a stereo project by treating the left and
right channels as completely independent signals. Unlike Joint Stereo encoding, stereo encoding will not try to take advantage
of similar information in left and right channels. As a result, Stereo Mode will completely preserve stereo separation without
trying to reduce the data.

 Mid/Side Stereo. Preserves most of the stereo effect of a file but at lower bandwidth. Not too useful at bit rates above 128
kbs.

Enable High Pass Filter/Low Pass Filter
These filters decrease your file size by eliminating frequencies that people don't usually hear anyway

Variable Bit Rate Encoding
Instead of producing a constant bit rate throughout the file, the Variable Bit Rate option optimizes the bit rate in different parts of the
file to use a higher bit rate where it will make a difference, and a lower one where it won’t. This option generally produces a better
quality file than constant bit rate encoding, but doesn’t produce the predictable file size you might need for downloadable files.

Quality Slider
MP3 encoding uses several techniques for analyzing sound and creating MP3 files. The slider provides the user with the ability to
specify how much time the encoder should spend analyzing the file.
When the slider is positioned to the far left, the encoder will spend more time analyzing and compressing the file. This will result in
the highest quality MP3 file, but it will take longest amount of time to compress it.
To reduce the time required to encode a project, you can position the slider further to the right. This will compress files quickly by
reducing the time spent analyzing the project. The trade-off for compressing quickly, or optimizing for speed, is that the resulting
MP3 file may have a lower sound quality.

Audio - Devices
Figure 618. The (audio) Devices section.

The Devices section displays a two-column list of available audio drivers. You can click the corresponding check box to enable/
disable a driver. Select the drivers you want to make available for recording and playback. You can change the driver name by
clicking the name in the first column and typing in your preferred name, or friendly name, for the driver.
The Devices section contains the following settings:

 Input Drivers. Input drivers are used for recording.
 Output Drivers. Output drivers are used for playback.
 Use Friendly Names to Represent Audio Drivers. If you enable this check box, the Input and Output menus in audio tracks
and buses will use whatever friendly names you’ve created for your Input and Output drivers. Friendly driver names are global,
not per-project.

 When using friendly name, you can specify both the left and right channels in the stereo pair by using the vertical bar symbol
“|” to delimit the channel names. For example, entering a friendly name of “Guitar|Voice” may show 1: Guitar, 2: Voice, 1+2:
Guitar + Voice in the menus.

 Show Mono Outputs. Select this option if you want to assign audio track and bus outputs to individual (mono) hardware
outputs in addition to stereo pairs. This is very useful, for example, if you record in Cakewalk but want to use an external mixing
console to mix. When enabled, mono hardware outputs are available in all locations that display audio output ports, with the
exception of the Media Browser view, Loop Construction view and Import Audio dialog box. Each available audio port exposes
Left, Right and Stereo channels.
Note: The Show Mono Outputs option only affects the display of mono hardware outputs in Cakewalk; it does not affect current
output port assignments on tracks and buses. Existing mono output assignments are retained even if you disable the Show
Mono Outputs option.

Audio - Driver Settings
Figure 619. The Driver Settings section.

The Driver Settings section lets you specify the audio timing master devices, default sampling rate and other audio settings.
The Driver Settings section contains the following settings:

 Playback Timing Master. If you’re using multiple wave drivers for playback, this list lets you specify which audio device should
control the playback timing.
Note: If you have two wave drivers, but all audio tracks are playing on only one wave driver, then that driver will be the timing
master no matter what you choose.

 Record Timing Master. If you’re using multiple wave drivers for playback, this list lets you specify which audio device should
control the recording timing.
Note: Every sound card’s clock crystal is slightly different, which causes minor differences in the actual playback rate on each
card. These differences may lead to slight synchronization problems if you use one card for recording and a different one for
playback. Multiple wave drivers on the same card will not have sync problems.
Audio Driver Bit Depth. Determines the number of bits per sample used for communicating with the audio hardware for playback.
Your audio hardware must be capable of supporting the setting you supply here. In Cakewalk, choose between 16, 18, 20, 22 and
24. In most cases, even if your hardware is “advertised” as being 18 or 20 bit, you will want to set this value to 24 for optimum
performance. Cakewalk 16-bit only.
Note: Using an audio driver bit depth that is greater than 16 means you also need to choose a preferred setting in the Stream
>16 Bit Data As field in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Audio Profiles.

1663
Preferences dialog

64-bit Double Precision Engine. Enabling this check box chooses 64-bit (double-precision) mixing in Cakewalk throughout the
entire signal path. This includes dithering and plug-ins. Cakewalk will send and receive 64-bit data to and from all plug-ins that
accept 64-bit data. If a plug-in requires 32-bit data, Cakewalk will send and receive 32-bit data.
Stereo Panning Law. Use this menu to choose a panning law for the current project and new projects. The current project’s
panning law is also displayed in the File Stats window, which appears when you open the File Info dialog box (Project > Info
command), and click the File Stats button. Determines the mathematical formula used to control panning. The choices are:

 (Default) 0dB center, sin/cos taper, constant power. This choice causes a 3 dB boost in a signal that’s panned hard left or
right, and no dip in output level in either channel when the signal is center panned.

 -3dB center, sin/cos taper, constant power. This choice causes no boost in a signal that’s panned hard left or right, and 3
dB dip in output level in either channel when the signal is center panned.

 0dB center, square-root taper, constant power. This choice causes a 3 dB boost in a signal that’s panned hard left or
right, and no dip in output level in either channel when the signal is center panned.

 -3dB center, square root taper, constant power. This choice causes no boost in a signal that’s panned hard left or right,
and 3 dB dip in output level in either channel when the signal is center panned.

 -6dB center, linear taper. This choice causes no boost in a signal that’s panned hard left or right, and 6 dB dip in output
level in either channel when the signal is center panned.

 0 dB center, balance control. This choice causes no boost in a signal that’s panned hard left or right, and no dip in output
level in either channel when the signal is center panned.
For more information about panning laws, see “Configuring panning laws” on page 319.

 Dim Solo Gain. Dim Solo is a mode in which non-soloed audio tracks/buses are still audible but at a reduced level. The default
gain reduction is -6 dB, but can also be configured for -12 dB and -18 dB. For more information about Dim Solo, see “Dim Solo
mode” on page 300.

Default Settings for New Projects
 Sampling Rate. The Sampling Rate list allows you to enter or select an audio sampling rate for a new project. After audio has
been added to the project—either by recording audio or by using the File > Import > Audio command—you can no longer
change the sampling rate for that project. Therefore, you should choose the sampling rate immediately after choosing File > New
to start a new song.
You can choose one of the following sampling rates: 11025 Hz, 22050 Hz, 44100 Hz, 48000 Hz, 88200, 96000, 176400 and
192000 Hz. The default used by Cakewalk is 44100 Hz, the same rate as audio CDs. However, you may choose a higher rate
and later mixdown to 44100.
You can also enter any hardware supported value in the Sampling Rate field. Consult your hardware documentation for
supported sampling rates.

Mixing Latency (MME and WDM drivers only)
 Buffers in Playback Queue. This value determines the buffer characteristics for transfers to and from the audio drivers.
Lowering this value improves audio “Latency” on page 1911, though making it too low makes your system more susceptible to
stuttering or dropouts.

 Buffer Size Slider. This control lets you set mixing latency manually, overriding the value set by the Wave Device Profiler.
Lower numbers increase the risk of audio problems. WDM sound card drivers offer lower latency than the older MME type.

1664
Preferences dialog

Wave Profiler (MME and WDM drivers only)
Wave Profiler attempts to detect the make and model of your sound card, which determine the card’s DMA (Direct Memory Access)
settings. Once Wave Profiler identifies the card, it displays the results and asks whether you want to use the default settings for that
card or to override them:
If Wave Profiler has identified your card correctly, you may accept the default settings. Otherwise, Wave Profiler will run a series of
tests to attempt to determine the correct DMA settings. Usually this process is successful; however, if it is not, you will need to enter
the correct settings in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Audio Profiles.
To determine the correct settings, consult your sound card documentation. Our website, at www.cakewalk.com, contains the latest
DMA settings for commonly used sound cards.
The Wave Profiler utility runs automatically the first time you run Cakewalk. You need not run it again unless you install a new sound
card or an updated driver for your current sound card.
Wave Profiler will not analyze the card at the 48 kHz sampling rate. It assumes that 48 kHz settings are the same as 44 kHz settings.
If your sound card doesn’t sync to 48 kHz, you may need to enter the settings manually.

ASIO Panel (ASIO drivers only)
This button opens a dialog box where you can set the buffer size for your ASIO driver and change the driver configuration. See your
sound card’s documentation for more information.

Audio - Playback and Recording
Figure 620. The (audio) Playback and Recording section.

The Playback and Recording section lets you specify various settings that affect playback and recording.
The Playback and Recording section contains the following settings:

 Driver Mode. Select from WASAPI Exclusive, WASAPI Shared, WDM/KS, ASIO, or MME. Consult your hardware
documentation to determine which driver your hardware uses. Use WASAPI Shared for sharing the audio device with Windows
and other programs, or WASAPI Exclusive for lower latency. WASAPI is ideal for use with onboard audio devices. Use ASIO if
you have a pro audio device with an ASIO driver.

 Dithering. Whenever an audio signal is converted from a higher-bit resolution to a lower resolution, it is necessary to apply
dither to avoid introducing undesirable quantization noise or harmonic distortion into the signal. The purpose of dither is to reduce
the resulting distortion by adding low-level random noise or “dither” to the audio signal. Different mathematical calculations are
used to generate dither, each method has advantages and disadvantages depending on the particular operation. Cakewalk
features the Pow-r dithering process, short for Psycho-acoustically Optimized Wordlength Reduction, which can produce lower-bit
files that sound indistinguishable from higher-bit source files. When this option is turned on, Cakewalk uses dithering when you
export a higher-bit file at a lower resolution, or lower the bit depth of a project’s audio files by using the Utilities > Change Audio
Format command, or when you “render” audio (bounce, freeze, or apply effects).
This option is turned on whenever the Dithering field has a value other than None. You can choose bit depths for recording,
importing, and rendering (bouncing, freezing, and applying effects) in Edit > Preferences > File - Audio Data, and for exporting
in the Export Audio dialog box (File > Export > Audio command). Cakewalk offers five kinds of dithering:

 Rectangular. Essentially white noise, no noise shaping. Advantages: least CPU-intensive, lowest signal-to-noise ratio,
preferable to shaped dither when successive dithering can occur (e.g. bouncing, freezing). Disadvantages: suffers from
intermodulation distortion, higher perceived loudness than Pow-r dither.

 Triangular. Higher level than rectangular, no noise shaping. Advantages: low CPU-intensive dither, superior to Rectangular
as it does not suffer from modulation noise effects. Preferable to shaped (Pow-r) dither when successive dithering can occur

1666
Preferences dialog

(e.g. bouncing, freezing). Disadvantages: higher perceived loudness than Pow-r dither.

 Pow-r 1. Noise-shaped dither. Advantages: less CPU-intensive than Pow-r types 2 and 3, lower perceived loudness than
Rectangular or Triangular. Disadvantages: less noise shaping than Pow-r types 2 and 3, not recommended for operations
where dither will be applied successively (e.g. bounce and freeze).

 Pow-r 2. Noise-shaped dither. Advantages: lowest perceived loudness, highest quality settings, recommended for audio
export. Disadvantages: highest CPU-intensive settings, not recommended for operations where dither will be applied
successively (e.g. bounce and freeze).

 Pow-r 3. Same as Pow-r 2 except most CPU-intensive and transparent of all choices.
 Suspend Audio Engine When Cakewalk Is Not in Focus. This option allows other software to access device drivers. When
this option is checked, other software can access device drivers when Cakewalk is not the focus of Windows.

 Use Multiprocessing Engine. This option is grayed out unless you have a multiprocessor computer. If you have a
multiprocessor computer, check this option if you want Cakewalk to use both processors at all times. If you do not check this
option, Cakewalk still uses the second processor for some tasks.

 Plug-In Load Balancing. When Use Multiprocessing Engine is enabled, the Plug-In Load Balancing option allows you
to distribute plug-in processing across multiple cores.

 Use MMCSS. This option gives real-time applications such as Cakewalk higher priority for resource scheduling (thread
scheduling) under Windows 7 and later (leave it checked).

 Always Stream Audio Through FX. If any tracks or buses contain active plug-in effects, the audio engine will be activated and
stream silence through the effects, even if the tracks have no audio data or Input Echo enabled. You will typically only disable this
option if you want to conserve a bit of CPU processing if you play a project that contains lots of empty audio tracks with effects.
There are several benefits to having this option enabled:

 Any effect with a “tail” (reverb, delay, etc.) will finish playing when playback is stopped.
 Effects will respond to automation envelopes, even on empty audio tracks.
 Many plug-ins do not update their UI properly until they receive audio input.
 Always Open All Devices. With this option checked, Cakewalk opens all enabled stereo pairs of audio outputs as soon as you
press play or turn on the audio engine. Any pairs that don’t have any tracks feeding them stream silence, but are still ready for
use. So if you then change a track's output assignment on the fly Cakewalk doesn’t have to reopen a device, which can cause
gaps in playback.

 Remove DC Offset During Record. With this option enabled, Cakewalk filters out any DC Offset disturbances that may be
present during recording. See “Removing DC offset” on page 941 for more information.

 Disable Input Monitoring During Playback. This option is off by default. When enabled, input monitoring will be disabled on
all tracks during playback but not during recording.

 Command Audition Length (seconds). When you apply an edit or effect to an audio clip, Cakewalk lets you audition that edit
for “N” seconds: the value you fill into this field.

 Record Pre-allocate File (seconds). When this option is set to a value greater than zero, Cakewalk will pre allocate the file to
be recorded to the size specified (in seconds). This means that the file will not be resized while recording until it reaches the
allocated size. The setting has the potential to reduce disk activity while recording and allows for more possible tracks. The valid
range is 0–14400 seconds and the default value is 0. A reasonable setting would be 10 minutes (600 seconds) to 30 minutes
(1800 seconds).

 Fade On Start (milliseconds). When this option is set to a value greater than zero, starting playback will cause a gradual fade
in of the audio for the specified duration. The valid range is 0–100000 and the default value is 0.

 Fade On Stop (milliseconds). When this option is set to a value greater than zero, stopping playback will cause a gradual fade
out of the audio for the specified duration. The valid range is 0–100000 and the default value is 0.

Stretch Methods
 Default. Specify the default global stretch methods (see “Algorithms and rendering” on page 795). The options are as follows:
 Online Render. Specify the algorithm to use during real-time playback.
• Groove.

This mode works faster than Percussion render mode, using less processing power.

• Percussion. This mode works better than the Groove render mode on percussive material, especially if the stretching is
by more than a few beats per minute.
• Elastique Pro. Elastique Pro is a general purpose high quality time-stretching engine that fulfills the demands of
professional productions and broadcast applications. It minimizes stretching artifacts, offers stable timing, inter-channel
phase coherence and sample accurate stretching which allows for sharp transients and crystal clear vocals.
• Elastique Efficient. Elastique Efficient gives you similar time-stretching quality as Elastique Pro, but with a lower CPU hit.
The algorithm is targeted at complex polyphonic signals like complete mixes and offers the same transient preservation as
Elastique Pro.

 Offline Render. Specify the algorithm to use when exporting, bouncing, or freezing stretched audio.
• Radius Mix. Better for clips containing polyphonic, stereo data.
• Radius Mix Advanced. Similar to Radius Mix, but exposes Radius Pitch Coherence and Radius Phase Coherence
sliders in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Playback and Recording.
• Radius Solo.

Better for clips containing monophonic, solo instruments.

• Radius Solo (Bass). Better for clips containing solo bass instruments.
• Radius Solo (Vocal).

Better for clips containing solo vocals.

• Elastique Pro. Elastique Pro is a general purpose high quality time-stretching engine that fulfills the demands of
professional productions and broadcast applications. It minimizes stretching artifacts, offers stable timing, inter-channel
phase coherence and sample accurate stretching which allows for sharp transients and crystal clear vocals.
• Elastique Efficient. Elastique Efficient gives you similar time-stretching quality as Elastique Pro, but with a lower CPU hit.
The algorithm is targeted at complex polyphonic signals like complete mixes and offers the same transient preservation as
Elastique Pro.
• Same as Online. Uses the same choice as the Online Render field.

 VocalSync. Specify the default global stretch methods to use for VocalSync clips (see “VocalSync automatic audio alignment”
on page 1188).

Radius Mix Advanced
The following settings apply when using the Radius Mix Advanced stretch method:

 Radius Pitch coherence. Pitch coherence preserves naturalness of timbre for pitched solo voices, such as human speech,
saxophone or vocals. The default value for this control is 50%. Higher values of pitch coherence will increase phase accuracy but
may sound more modulated.

 Radius Phase coherence. When processing stereo or surround audio, Phase coherence helps to preserve the phase
relationships between channels. The default value for this control is 50%. Higher values of phase coherence will preserve the
phase between multiple audio channels at the expense of slight distortion.

Audio - Sync and Caching (Advanced)
Figure 623. The Sync and Caching section.

The Sync and Caching section lets you specify audio synchronization and hard disk cache settings.
The Sync and Caching section contains the following settings:

Synchronization
Cakewalk gives you two choices for synchronizing your audio tracks to SMPTE or MIDI Time Code:

 Trigger and Freewheel. With this option audio playback starts (or triggers) at the exact timecode, but then the audio plays at its
own internal rate. The audio can gradually drift away from SMPTE time due to variations in the timecode signal.

 Full Chase Lock. With this option the speed of audio playback is continuously adjusted to stay with the timecode.
 Timing Offset (msec). With this option, used for making very fine adjustments to the audio/MIDI synchronization of your
project, you can offset the audio in your project by a number of milliseconds. A positive value delays audio by that amount. A
negative value delays MIDI by that amount.

 When SMPTE/MTC timecode is detected. This option tells Cakewalk what to do when it detects SMPTE/MTC timecode.
Choose from the following:

 Ask first, then switch to clock source and start. This option prompts Cakewalk to alert you when it detects a SMPTE/
MTC signal, asks if you want to sync to the incoming signal, and if you respond that you do, switches the clock source and
starts to receive the signal.

 Always switch the clock source and start. Cakewalk automatically switches to the clock source of the incoming signal
and begins to receive the signal.

 Do not switch clock source, but start if in SMPTE/MTC mode. This option automatically syncs to the incoming signal if
Cakewalk is in SMPTE/MTC mode.

1672
Preferences dialog

 Never switch clock source, never start. Cakewalk does nothing when incoming SMPTE/MTC timecode is detected.
Note: The final option, Never switch clock source, never start, should never be used if you are attempting to sync to an
external clock source.

 When clock source is set to SMPTE/MTC or MIDI Sync, pressing play in Cakewalk will. This option tells Cakewalk what to
do when you press play in SMPTE/MTC or MIDI Sync mode:

 Switch current clock source and start playback. Switch the clock to Audio (from SMPTE or Sync), and start playback.
This cancels SMPTE (or Sync) mode.

 Maintain current clock source and wait for timecode. Do not switch the clock (Stay in SMPTE or Sync mode), but wait for
SMPTE or Sync. The playback button remains depressed.

File System
 Enable Read Caching and Enable Write Caching. Choosing either of these options lets Cakewalk use the Windows disk
cache while reading or writing audio data. Cakewalk will usually perform best with all caching disabled, which is the default
setting. If your computer has an older IDE disk controller, or a disk controller that does not use DMA transfers, enabling caching
may improve Cakewalk’s audio performance.
Note: Changes to these settings only take effect when you restart Cakewalk.

 I/O Buffer Size. This value determines the buffer characteristics for transfers to and from the disk. Changing this value does not
affect audio latency, but will affect the disk throughput for audio tracks. The default setting is 128. A higher value causes more
audio to be buffered from the disk ahead of the playback cursor. If you are hearing consistent dropouts/clicks in your audio and if
your project contains high bit depth (32/64 bit) or high sample rate audio (88.2K or higher), it may be indicative of a too small I/O
buffer size. If so, try a higher I/O buffer size like 256 or 512. If audio problems persist, reset to 128 and try a different remedy.
Also, if you are playing a large file, and using maximum latency, a too-small I/O buffer size may cause dropouts or crashes. Try
increasing the buffer size by blocks of 128.

Record Latency Adjustment (samples)
If you loop an audio output back into an audio input, and re-record a track this way, the audio doesn’t line up. For some sound cards,
it is off quite significantly. This record latency adjustment is a compensation for that delay.
You can do an approximate measurement of the delay by turning on samples as the resolution unit in the Time Ruler, and comparing
the original track with the re-recorded track. Then you can enter a value in the Manual Offset field to compensate.
If you use ASIO mode, enter 0 in the Manual Offset field and leave the Reported Input Latency check box checked (this check box
only appears in ASIO mode). This will line up audio in most cases. If you think you can tweak it closer, use the Manual Offset field.
In ASIO mode, the current active ASIO device (remember ASIO can only have one active at a time) reports its “Input Latency.” You
can't edit this value. This supposedly accounts for buffer size, A/D Conversion latency, etc. The check box allows you to use this
reported value. It is checked by default. In any case, the amount entered into the Manual Offset field will be combined (added to)
the reported value if you have it checked.

MIDI - Devices
Figure 624. The (MIDI) Devices section.

The Devices section lets you choose the MIDI inputs and outputs you want to use. The selection in the Output menu for a track
determines which piece of hardware will be used to produce the sound stored in your project. The list of enabled input devices
determines which input MIDI devices can successfully send MIDI data into your Cakewalk application.
You can make up your own friendly names for the MIDI input and output devices listed in this dialog box. The friendly name for a
MIDI device is the name you will see in MIDI track Input and Output menus, if you enable the Use Friendly Names To Represent
MIDI Devices check box at the bottom of this dialog box. To make up a friendly name, double-click the name of a device in the
Friendly Name column, type a new name, and press ENTER.

The Devices section contains the following settings:

Inputs
Select devices from the list (you may have only one). Cakewalk accepts input from these devices for recording MIDI data.

Outputs
Select devices from the list. If your computer or MIDI interface has several MIDI outputs, you choose the ones you want to use and
put them in a particular order. From then on, MIDI output 1 refers to the first selected MIDI output, MIDI output 2 to the second
selected MIDI output, and so on. The output number is based solely on the order in which the selected outputs appear in the
Outputs list. As a result, the output numbers used in Cakewalk may not match the output numbers that appear on your external
multiport MIDI interface.

Move Checked Output Devices to Top button
Click this button to move a checked output device farther up in the list, directly behind any other checked devices. If you want a
particular device to become MIDI output 1, deselect all other devices, select the device you want to be number 1, and click the Move

MIDI - Playback and Recording
Figure 625. The (MIDI) Playback and Recording section.

The Playback and Recording (MIDI) section lets you specify MIDI echo settings, MIDI playback buffer size, and which MIDI events
should be recorded.
The Playback and Recording section contains the following settings:

Driver Mode

Note: The Driver Mode setting can only be changed in Windows 10 and later, and when no projects are open.

In addition to the MME MIDI API, Cakewalk supports the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) MIDI API introduced in Windows 10.
UWP MIDI provides a modern way to communicate with MIDI devices and can be extended to support newer MIDI protocols/
interfaces.
UWP MIDI has several advantages over MME MIDI, including support for the Bluetooth LE MIDI protocol and multi-client access to
MIDI ports.

Preferences dialog

Record
Use the fields in this section to choose what MIDI events you want to record. Choose any or all of these options:

 Allow MIDI Recording without an Armed Track. By default, Cakewalk requires you to arm a track before recording.
 Notes. Select this check box if you want to record Note events.
 Key Aftertouch. Select this check box if you want to record Key Aftertouch events.
 Controller events. Select this check box if you want to record Controller events.
 Patch Changes. Select this check box if you want to record Patch Change events.
 Channel Aftertouch. Select this check box if you want to record Channel Aftertouch events.
 Pitch Wheel. Select this check box if you want to record Pitch Wheel events.
 System Exclusive. Select this check box if you want to record Sysx data.
 Number of Buffers. Choose how many MIDI buffers you want Cakewalk to use. The default value of 64 works well most of
the time. If you experience frequent MIDI overflow from using MIDI plug-ins or lots of Sysx data, try a larger number, such as
128.

 Echo System Exclusive. Choose this if you want to echo Sysx data to the MIDI ports shown in the MIDI Sysx Echo Ports
list.

 MIDI Sysx Echo Ports. This list lets you specify which MIDI ports to echo Sysx data on.
Playback
 Prepare Using N Millisecond Buffers. This option lets you specify how far in advance Cakewalk prepares MIDI data during
playback. The default is 200 milliseconds.
If playback stops prematurely, you may try larger values (although you should also check the buffer options in Edit >
Preferences > Audio - Sync and Caching).
If you are using MIDI effects, you may want to try smaller values—for example, 50 milliseconds. Doing so means that, if you
change a property for a MIDI effect, there will be less delay before you hear the new value take effect.
For more information, see:
“MIDI track parameters” on page 306
“Recording music from a MIDI instrument” on page 356

 Always Echo Current MIDI Track. This option is on by default, and means that incoming MIDI data will always be echoed
through the current track, even if the track’s Input Echo button is in the Off position.

MIDI Files
 Always use Sysx Banks for MIDI Files (Instead of Sysx Data). If you check this option, Cakewalk puts any sysx data
contained in imported MIDI files into sysx banks instead of a stream of sysxdata events (except for auto-send data, which is sent
before playback). These banks show up in the Event list as bank events. If you don’t check this option, imported sysx data
remains as sysx data events if it is up to 255 bytes, and is put into banks if it is 256 or more bytes.

 Write Cable Meta Events to MIDI Files (Port Select). If you select this option, Cakewalk can change the default output that a
following (upcoming) sysx bank is sent to. The output select number is also inserted into the front of each track of a format 1 MIDI
file to specify the output number.

MIDI - Instruments
Figure 626. The Instruments section.

The Instruments section lets you choose one or more output/channel configurations and assign an instrument to it or them.
Cakewalk lets you assign a MIDI instrument definition to each available MIDI output and channel. The assignments you make
determine the MIDI bank names, patch names, note names, and controller names that you see during your Cakewalk session.
Suppose that you have a Roland GS compatible synthesizer attached to MIDI output 1. By assigning all 16 channels of MIDI output
1 to the Roland GS instrument definition, you ensure that the bank, patch, note and controller name lists you see displayed in
Cakewalk are the ones that match your synthesizer.
Often, you want to assign a different instrument to channel 10, which is usually used for percussion. For example, you might assign
the Roland GS instrument definition to channels 1 through 9 and 11 through 16, but you would most likely want to assign the Roland
GS Drumsets instrument definition to channel 10. If you have several MIDI outputs, with a different instrument attached to each one,
you would normally assign a different instrument to each MIDI output.
For convenience, you can assign a block of channels to one instrument, and then change the assignment of one or more of those
channels without changing the others. For example, you can highlight all 16 channels of the first MIDI output and assign them to the
Roland GS instrument definition. Then, you can highlight channel 10 of the first MIDI output and assign it to the Roland GS Drumset
instrument definition. Channels 1 through 9 and 11 through 16 on the first MIDI output will stay assigned to Roland GS.
You might also want to split channels to different instruments if you have several instruments attached to a single MIDI output. For
example, you might have a Roland synth receiving on MIDI channels 1-9, a Roland drum machine receiving on channel 10, and a
basic GM-compatible synth receiving on channels 11 through 16. In this case, you'd use three different instrument definitions for
your one and only MIDI output.

1678
Preferences dialog

The Instruments section contains the following settings:

Output/Channel
This field lists all your MIDI outputs and all the channels for each output. Highlight the output/channel combination you want to
assign an instrument definition to. You can select several output/channel combinations at the same time (for example, all 16
channels of a output) by CTRL-clicking or SHIFT-clicking.

Uses Instrument
This field lists all the instrument definitions that are currently stored by Cakewalk. Selecting one binds it to any output/channel
combinations that are selected in the Output/Channel field.

Save Changes for Next Session
Click this check box if you want to reuse any new combinations you made the next time you open Cakewalk.

Define button
Clicking this button opens the Define Instruments and Names dialog box, which allows you to define your own MIDI instruments, if
they are not MIDI standard.

MIDI - Control Surfaces
Figure 627. The Control Surfaces section.

The Control Surfaces section allows you to enable as many control surfaces as you want to control with Cakewalk, and configure
the control surfaces’ interfaces. You can also configure the WAI display (Where Am I display) and ACT indicators.
The Control Surfaces section contains the following fields and buttons:

Import ACT Data
You can use ACT with any automatable plug-in. You can create your own mappings by using the ACT Learn button, but because
ACT Learn mappings are stored in XML files, you can also import XML data that contains predefined parameter mappings for certain
plug-ins. These predefined parameter mappings provide generic “best guess” assignments between the controls on your surface,
and the parameters in the plug-in, which gives you a starting point that you can customize by using the ACT Learn process.
The import feature makes it easy for users to share data, and will also allow you to download incremental updates when new plug-in
mappings become available.
If you import ACT data for a certain plug-in, and you have already mapped some of the parameters in that plug-in, for each alreadymapped plug-in, a dialog box asks you if you want to overwrite that plug-in's mapping. This lets you protect any parameter mappings
that you've already done.
To see if any new ACT XML files are currently available, check the support pages at www.cakewalk.com.
See:
“Importing ACT data” on page 1404

Add Button
Clicking this button opens the “Controller/Surface Settings dialog” on page 1603, which lets you to add another control surface to the
list.

Preferences dialog

Delete Button
Clicking this button deletes and disables a selected control surface from the list. You can re-enable it by clicking the Add button and
selecting it from the drop-down menu.

Connected Controllers/Surfaces List
This is a list of all the control surfaces that are currently active and enabled in your project. The list has the following columns:

 Controller/Surface column. This column lists the names of all the control surfaces that are currently active and enabled in your
project.

 In Port and Out Port columns. These columns list MIDI input and MIDI output drivers that each control surface uses to
communicate with Cakewalk. You can click the drop-down arrow next to the name of each one to select a different driver.

 ACT column. This column contains a check box for each enabled control surface that allows you to use ACT with each
controller/surface. The property page for each controller/surface also has a check box to enable ACT, and this check box must
also be enabled in order to use ACT.

 WAI column. This column contains a check box for each enabled control surface that allows you to show or hide the WAI
markers for each individual surface.

 WAI color column. This column contains a drop-down menu for each enabled control surface that allows you to change the
color of the WAI markers for each individual surface.

Refresh Frequency (milliseconds)
If you are experiencing sluggish UI responsiveness when using a control surface and playing back high CPU projects, you may want
to reduce the control surface refresh frequency (increase the number of milliseconds). The valid range is 50-5000 milliseconds and
the default value is 75.
Also, if you are using a control surface that is not bi-directional, the surface does not need to be refreshed at all and you can safely
increase the value.
Note: This is the same setting as the CtrlSurfaceRefreshMS variable in Cakewalk.ini.

WAI Display
These check boxes show or hide the WAI markers in the Track view and/or the Console view.
For more information, see:
“External devices” on page 1385
“Controller/Surface Settings dialog” on page 1603

Control Strips Visible in
Cakewalk allows control surfaces to display all channel strips in a project, or only the channel strips that are visible in the Track view
or Console view. The options are as follows:

 Track View. The controller/surface matches the channel strips that are visible in the Track view.
 Console View. The controller/surface matches the channel strips that are visible in the Console view.
 All Strips. The controller/surface shows all channel strips in the project.

The Folder Locations section lets you specify default folders for different kinds of Cakewalk files. The default locations for all of
these file types usually work well. However, if you find that this folder gets cluttered, changing the locations of the file types won’t hurt
anything, as long as you remember where you put things.
Note: The only folder location you have to be careful with is the Global Audio folder (listed in Edit > Preferences > File - Audio
Data), which Cakewalk creates in the C:\Cakewalk Projects folder. Cakewalk stores all audio data that is associated with project
files in this folder. If you move this folder, Cakewalk can not find the audio data for projects you have already recorded. To tell
Cakewalk where you moved the folder, fill in the location in the Global Audio Folder field in Edit > Preferences > File - Audio
Data.

1684

File - Audio Data
Figure 630. The Audio Data section.

The Audio Data section lets you specify settings for recording, rendering and importing audio data.
The Audio Data section contains the following settings:

All Projects
 Global Audio Folder. The Global Audio Folder is used to store audio for older, non-per-project audio projects, as well as a
temporary folder for unpacked bundle files and to store audio for as yet unnamed projects.

 Picture Folder. This folder contains the waveform images for all audio files in all your projects.
 Always copy imported audio files. When checked this option forces Cakewalk to always copy all imported audio files to your
audio data directory. If you want to keep all your audio files in one location, always keep this option checked.

 Always Import Broadcast Waves at Their Timestamp. Forces Cakewalk to ignore the Now Time when importing Broadcast
Wave files. When this option is checked, Broadcast Waves begin at their SMPTE timestamp in your project.

 Export Broadcast Waves by Default. Check this option if you want the Broadcast Waves option to appear by default in the
Export Audio dialog box.

 Apply SMPTE Offset to Broadcast Wave Timestamps. Check this option if you want to add the SMPTE/MTC Offset value
(listed in Edit > Preferences > Project - Clock) to the timestamps of the Wave files that you export from Cakewalk.

1687
Preferences dialog

 Allow importing of WAV File Cue Markers. Check this option if you want Cakewalk to import cue markers that may exist in
wave files.
Many field recorders, such as the Edirol R-4, can add cue markers to the wave files that they record. If you import these wave
files into Cakewalk, the markers appear as standard Cakewalk markers on the Time Ruler.
Marker names are based on the imported file name, and are numbered sequentially, with a limit of 16 characters <file name…>
1, <file name…> 2, etc.

 Clip Tail Duration N Seconds. This option lets you specify how long to extend the duration of clips during export to account for
effect tails, such as reverb and delay.

File Bit Depths
 Record Bit Depth. Use this field to choose the bit depth that recorded audio data will use. You can change this at any time.
 Render Bit Depth. Use this field to choose the bit depth that audio processing (freezing, bouncing, applying effects) will use.
The default value of 32 allows virtually lossless processing.

 Import Bit Depth. Use this field to choose the bit depth that imported audio will use. The default choice of Original keeps the
imported audio at its current bit depth.

Figure 631. The VST Settings section.

The VST Settings section lets you manage VST effect and instrument plug-ins.
The VST Settings section contains the following settings:

VST Scan Paths
This window lists the folders that are scanned for VST plug-ins. “Scanning” a VST plug-in means adapting the plug-in’s file format so
that the plug-in works in Cakewalk.
To add folders or remove folders, use the following buttons:

 Add. This button opens the Browse for Folder dialog box, which allows you to select a new folder to be scanned.
 Remove. To remove a folder from the to-be-scanned list, first select the folder, and then click the Remove button.
Scan Options
This group of commands controls the following options:

 Specify when to scan for new VST plug-ins. The options are as follows:
 Automatic Background Scan. Cakewalk automatically scans the folders in the VST Scan Paths list in the background by
periodically detecting when data in the folders have been updated, or the scan paths have changed.

 Scan On Startup. The folders listed in the VST Scan Paths list are searched for new plug-ins whenever you start
Cakewalk. Scanning occurs in the background.

 Manual Scan. The folders listed in the VST Scan Paths list are searched for new plug-ins when you click the Scan button.
 Rescan Failed Plug-Ins. Checking this option causes any plug-in(s) that didn’t scan correctly to be rescanned during the next
scan.

 Rescan All Plug-Ins. Checking this option causes plug-in(s) that did scan correctly to be rescanned during the next scan. This
is a way to implement any changes you’ve made to the Folder defaults settings.

1689
Preferences dialog

 Scan in Sandbox. Scan each plug-in within a private scanner process. While this is slightly slower, it is more robust and
prevents plug-ins from corrupting or stopping the scanning process.

 Generate Scan Log. Log the VST scanning progress to %APPDATA%\Cakewalk\Logs\VstScan.log. This can be useful to
troubleshoot problems when plug-ins fail to scan properly.
Note: Logging is intended for diagnostic purposes, and can have overhead. Generate Scan Log should only be enabled if
instructed by BandLab technical support.

 Scan. Click this button to immediately scan the folders listed in the VST Scan Paths list.
 Reset. Click this button to remove all scanning records and settings from all your VST plug-ins. Use this button if you want to
completely start over.

VST3 Migration
 Hide Related VST2 Plug-Ins. If you have both VST2 and VST3 versions of a plug-in, you can instruct Cakewalk to
automatically hide any redundant VST2 plug-ins from Cakewalk’s plug-in menus.

 Replace If Possible on Project Load. If you have both VST2 and VST3 versions of a plug-in, you can instruct Cakewalk to
automatically upgrade to the VST3 version when loading a project that uses VST2 plug-ins.
The following table shows the expected plug-in substitution results when opening projects containing VST plug-ins.

BitBridge Server Configuration
Cakewalk’s BitBridge technology allows you to use 32-bit VST effects and instruments when using the x64 version of Cakewalk.
32-bit VST effects and instruments are loaded into “servers”, and each server can address up to 4GB of RAM. BitBridge supports up
to 32 independent plug-in servers, and each server can address up to 4GB of RAM, allowing access to a massive 128GB of RAM.
This allows Cakewalk x64 to address all available RAM in your computer.
By default, Cakewalk manages memory automatically, and will allocate and allow access to all available RAM dynamically as plugin's are used. This is done by dynamically creating new BitBridge servers only when necessary, up to a maximum of the available
RAM.
Server loading is either automatic or customizable, giving you full control over which server to load plug-ins into. To enable automatic
server loading, select Automatic (Based on available RAM). To manually manage BitBridge servers, select the server that you
want plug-ins to be loaded into.
After a specific server is selected, all plug-ins subsequently loaded will be loaded into that specific server, bypassing Cakewalk's
automatic memory management. This also applies when you load a project that contains VST plug-ins.
Tip: To more optimally use your available memory, assign memory hungry VSTs to their own private BitBridge server. The actual
memory consumed by a server instance is shown in the server list, allowing you choose which server you may want to load into.
Custom server assignments are saved with the project file.
Note: Server management is common for all loaded projects. If you have multiple projects open simultaneously, you can
potentially overflow the 4GB capacity of a server if the projects reference the same server. Under this condition, a plug-in may
fail to load. If this occurs, close the current project before opening another project.

Tip: To open a BitBridge plug-ins preset window in addition to its UI, hold down the ALT key and click the BitBridge plug-in in an FX
Rack.

General
 Recycle Plug-In Windows. By default, Cakewalk recycles the currently-open plug-in window when you open a new plug-in UI,
and all previously open plug-in windows are closed. This prevents Cakewalk from being filled with numerous open plug-in
windows, and you don’t have to manually close plug-in windows that are no longer needed.
If you prefer to always open a separate window for each plug-in, clear the Recycle Plug-In Windows check box.
To toggle the current behavior, hold down the CTRL key when you open a plug-in UI:

 If Recycle Plug-In Windows is enabled when you hold down the CTRL key to open a plug-in, all other open plug-in widows
also become pinned.

 If Recycle Plug-In Windows is disabled when you hold down the CTRL key to open a plug-in, all other open plug-in widows
close, and the new plug-in window is unpinned.
You can also pin individual plug-in windows so they remain open when you open another plug-in window. To do so, click the Pin
Plug-In Window button

on the plug-in property page.

Pinning windows is the only way you can have multiple plug-in windows open simultaneously.

Note: Plug-ins that are docked in the MultiDock are not affected by the Recycle Plug-In Windows setting. Docked plug-ins are
automatically pinned and cannot be unpinned. To dock a plug-in window, hold down the CTRL key and drag the window to the
MultiDock.

Note: Plug-in window recycling is disabled when loading projects, which ensures that projects open with all previously open
windows.

Note: There are two other initialization files stored in the Cakewalk program folder:
• TTSseq.ini
• Aud.ini
You can edit these files with a text editor, such as Windows Notepad. For more information, see “Initialization files” on page 1460 and
“Configuration Settings” on page 1670.

Warning: There are several other .ini files in the Cakewalk folder, but you should not attempt to edit or modify these files in any
way. Changes to these other files could cause Cakewalk to stop operating properly.
Before making any changes to any of the .ini files, you should make a backup copy in case you make a mistake. After you have made
your changes, save the file and close Notepad. Cakewalk reads the settings in these files only when it first starts up. Therefore, if you
change any settings while Cakewalk is running, you should exit and restart Cakewalk in order for the changes to take effect.
The Initialization File section contains the following fields:

File - Advanced (Advanced)
Figure 633. The Advanced (File) section.

The Advanced section lets you specify auto-save, file versioning and other project file settings.

1694
Preferences dialog

The Advanced section contains the following settings:

 Auto-save Every “N” Minutes or “N” Changes. Choose how many minutes or edits between automatic saves.
 Enable Versioning of Project (.CWP) Files. Checking this check box causes Cakewalk to save successive versions of a
project with the date the project was saved in the file name. The most recent version has no date in the name.

 Number of versions to keep. If you enable the versioning option, you can use this field to choose how many versions to
keep. When the maximum number of files is reached, the oldest file is deleted.

 Load Non-Cakewalk Files in Offset Mode. This option causes .smf, .mid, .rmi, .wrk and .cwb/bun files to open in Offset mode
(see “Envelope mode and Offset mode” on page 1232).
For more information about Offset mode, see “Envelope mode and Offset mode” on page 1232.

 Allow Only One Open Project at a Time. If you select this check box, when you open a new project Cakewalk will close any
project that is already open and ask if you want to save any changes.

 Ask before Sending System Exclusive (When Opening Projects). If you check this option and then open a project that
contains sysx data, Cakewalk asks you before sending the sysx data.

 On Startup Load Default Template. This option lets you load the default template automatically when you launch Cakewalk,
without having to first specify a project name and audio folder. While you record audio into the new project, the audio data is
stored in the global audio folder until you save the file, at which point you can choose to create a per-project audio folder, or retain
the audio in the global audio folder. For information about specifying the default template, see “To specify the default project
template” on page 1259.

 Create Default Drum Map for Non-Cakewalk Files. This option ensures that when you load a Standard MIDI File, you won’t
have to create a drum map from scratch—Cakewalk creates a basic one for you.

Project - Record
Figure 634. The Record section.

The Record section lets you specify how Cakewalk records clips into tracks that already contain other clips. If you use loop
recording, you can also specify whether to record takes in sequential tracks or stacked in a single track.
Note: Cakewalk saves the recording options you choose with each project, so you can save a different recording mode with
each of your projects.

1696
Preferences dialog

The Record section contains the following settings:

Recording Mode
Choose one of the following options:

 Comping. Choose this option to create Take lanes and add sound to any pre-existing sound in the part of the track you are
recording into. Pre-existing data will be automatically muted for the duration of the new recording.

 Sound on Sound. Choose this option to add sound to any pre-existing sound in the track you are recording into.
 Overwrite. Choose this option to overwrite any pre-existing sound in the part of the track you are recording into. Similar to
Comping, but will non-destructively delete instead of mute pre-existing data.

 Allow Arm Changes During Playback/Record. Select this (global) option if you want to arm and disarm tracks during
playback and recording. This allows you to record to different tracks while the transport is rolling, without first having to stop
playback in order to arm a track for recording.
Note: The Allow Arm Changes During Playback/Record option is disabled by default. When enabled, Cakewalk must keep
all hardware input ports open so that it can dynamically arm tracks on the fly. With some drivers in WDM mode, this can add
significant overhead if there are many input devices enabled in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Devices. This may lead to more
frequent drop outs. When using this option in WDM mode, it is recommended that you disable all unused input drivers to
minimize this overhead. Disabling unused inputs is not required when using ASIO mode.

 Only For Inputs in Project. When Allow Arm Changes During Playback/Record is enabled, Cakewalk must keep all
hardware input ports open so that it can dynamically arm tracks on the fly. With some drivers in WDM mode, this can add
significant overhead if there are many input devices enabled in Edit > Preferences > Audio - Devices. The Only For Inputs in
Project option instructs Cakewalk to only open hardware input ports that are currently active in the project (i.e. assigned to a
track).
Note: If this option is enabled, you will not be able to change inputs while recording.

 Exclude Synth Inputs. When Allow Arm Changes During Playback/Record is enabled, Cakewalk always pre-creates record
files for synth inputs so that it can dynamically arm synth tracks on the fly. This can add significant overhead and may lead to lag
in starting and stopping the transport in projects that contain many synth tracks. The Exclude Synth Inputs option instructs
Cakewalk to not allow dynamic arming of synth tracks, thereby avoiding the overhead. When enabled, synth tracks can only be
armed when the transport is stopped.

 Auto Punch. Choose this option to punch record, and then set the following options:
 Punch In Time. Enter the time where you want the new recording activity to begin.
 Punch Out Time. Enter the time where you want the new recording activity to end.
 Mute Previous Takes. Uncheck this option in Sound on Sound mode if you want to hear previous takes during Auto Punch.
Note: The Mute Previous Takes option has no effect during loop recording.

Loop Recording
Choose one of the following loop recording options:

 Store Takes in a Single Track. Choosing this option causes Cakewalk to merge every new take with the previous takes, unless
you choose Comping or Overwrite mode, which mutes each take except the newest one.

 Store Takes in Separate Tracks. Choosing this option causes Cakewalk to place each new take in the next available track.
This method can quickly overwhelm your computer if you are recording audio data.

1697
Preferences dialog

Take Behavior
Specify how Take lanes are created when recording new takes:

 Create New Lane. Always create a new lane for each take.
 Reuse Existing Lane. Reuse existing lanes for each take (this option is not available when using the Comping record mode).
 Reuse Existing Lane, Unless Takes Overlap. Reuse existing lanes for each take, and only create new lanes if takes overlap.
 New Takes on Top. Choosing this option causes Cakewalk to place the newest take above existing Take lanes. When disabled,
the newest take is placed below existing Take lanes.

Multi-Track Grouping
You can specify how clips should be grouped when recording multiple tracks simultaneously. The following options are available:

 Group all clips. All clips that are recorded at the same time are placed in a clip group.
 Group only clips in folders (default). All clips in folders are grouped. Different folders have different groups. Tracks not in
folders are not grouped.

 Do not group tracks. Each new take will belong to a different clip group if loop recording is enabled.
For more information, see “Clip selection groups” on page 506.

Project - MIDI
Figure 635. The MIDI section.

The MIDI section lets you specify MIDI Sync and MIDI Machine Control (MMC) settings.
The MIDI section contains the following settings:

MIDI Machine Control (MMC)
This section allows you to control MMC devices from Cakewalk, and has the following options;

 Transmit MMC. Choosing this option causes Cakewalk to send standard MMC commands such as start, stop, rewind, etc., to
any MMC devices that are connected to your computer.

 Timecode Master’s Unit ID. If you have several MMC devices connected to your computer, for example three ADAT
machines, one of them will be the timing master, and Cakewalk and the other MMC devices will slave to its timing. Fill in the ID
number of the master MMC device, so that Cakewalk’s MMC commands go to the right device.

Other Options
 Zero Controllers When Play Stops. If you choose this option, Cakewalk sets the controller values of the pitch wheel, the
sustain pedal, and the modulation wheel on all 16 MIDI channels to zero. It also sends a “zero all continuous controllers” MIDI
message which turns off other continuous controllers on newer synthesizers. If you experience frequent stuck notes when
playback stops, try checking this option.

 MIDI Event Chase on Play. If you choose this option, Cakewalk finds and sends the most recent patch changes, wheel events,
and pedal events before starting playback. This way, all settings are correct even if you start playback at an arbitrary point in the
project.

 Include Note Events. When MIDI Event Chase on Play is enabled, the Include Note Events option allows MIDI Note
events to play even if they start earlier than the initial playback location.
See also:
“MIDI Machine Control (MMC)” on page 1346.

1699
Preferences dialog

Send MIDI Sync
When Cakewalk is the timing master in a master/slave synchronized setup, use this section to set MIDI Sync options:

 Transmit MIDI Start/Continue/Stop/Clock. Choosing this option causes Cakewalk to tell the slave when to start, when to
continue, when to stop, and what timing data to go by (Cakewalk’s).

 Use Start, Never Continue (disabled unless you select the previous option). Choosing this option causes Cakewalk to only
transmit MIDI Start messages every time it restarts, even in the middle of a song. If you have a drum machine slaved to Cakewalk,
and the drum machine is playing looped patterns, you probably want it to start at the beginning of its loop whenever Cakewalk
restarts, even if Cakewalk restarts from the middle of a song.

 Transmit MIDI Song Position Pointer (SPP). Choosing this option causes Cakewalk to send an SPP message before starting
or continuing playback. If you are using a drum machine as described above, you might want to disable this option.

 Locate Delay for SPP Recipient. Some older MIDI devices take a small amount of time to respond to SPP messages. This
option causes Cakewalk to delay briefly after sending an SPP message, in order to give the slave device time to respond. The
delay is in 1/18ths of a second. Enter 1 for a 1/18th second delay, 2 for 2/18ths of a second, or 18 for a full second delay.

 MIDI Sync Output Ports. Choose the outputs that your slave devices are connected to.
Send MIDI Time Code
When Cakewalk is the timing master in a master/slave synchronized setup, use these options to send and configure MIDI Time
Code (MTC):

 Transmit MTC. Check this box if you want Cakewalk to transmit MTC. You can also turn this option on or off at the Sync
toolbar.

 Frame Rate. Use this drop-down menu to choose the frame rate for your project (see “Frame rates” on page 1342, if
necessary).

 MTC Output Ports. Check off the output ports that you want Cakewalk to send MTC out of.

Monitor with Bass Management
When enabled, a combo box lets you specify one of the following cutoff frequencies:

 80 (Dolby consumer/DVD) (default)
 116 (DTS)
 120 (Dolby pro/film)
 180
Low-pass Cutoff
All signals below the cutoff frequency are directed from the main channels to the LFE channel output.

Downmixing
 Center Level. Center channel content is distributed equally into left and right channels of a 2-channel downmix with one of a
choice of three levels. Each level is how much of center is mixed into both left and right. The alternatives are:

 -3 dB. This is the right amount to distribute into two acoustic sources to reach the same sound power level, thus keeping the
far-field level (in the reverberant listening field, as is typical at home) equal. This is the amount by which a standard sin-cos
panner redistributes a center panned image into left and right, for instance.

 -4.5 dB. Since -3 dB and -6 dB represent the extreme limits (of power addition on the one hand, or of phase-dependent
vector addition on the other), an intermediate, compromise value was seen as valuable, since the correct answer has to be 4.5 dB +/- 1.5 dB.

 -6 dB. This covers the case where listening is dominated by direct sound. Thus, the two source signals add up by 6 dB
rather than by 3 dB, because they add as vectors, as voltages do, rather than as power does.

 Surround Level. Surround Downmix Level is the amount of Left Surround to mix into Left, and Right Surround to Right, when
mixing down from any surround-equipped format to 2 channel. The available options are:

 -3 dB. The amount by which mono surround information, from many movie mixes before discrete 5.1 was available, mixes
down to maintain the same level as the original.

 -6 dB. An amount that makes the mixdown of surround content not so prominent, based on the fact that most surround
content is not as important as a lot of front content. This helps to avoid competition with dialog box, for instance, by heavy
surround tracks in a mixdown situation.

 -INF. Necessary for cases where the surround levels are so high that they compete with the front channels too much in
mixdown situations.

 LFE Level. Choose -INF or -12 dB.

 Show Notifications. This option tells Cakewalk to show or hide all pop-up toast notifications at the bottom of the screen,
including VST Scan, Project Load, and program update notifications.

 Show Update Notifications. This option tells Cakewalk to show a pop-up toast notification at the bottom of the screen if a
program update is available. Your computer must have an active internet connection.

 Show Project Load Notifications. This option tells Cakewalk to show a pop-up toast notification that shows the status
while loading a large project.

 Timeout. Specify how many seconds a toast notification should remain visible after the last notification is received. The
range is 1–10 seconds, and the default value is 5.

 Show Start Screen. This option tells Cakewalk to automatically show the Start Screen when you launch the program and when
no project is open.

 Show Audio/MIDI Device Change Notifications. Show a message if an audio or MIDI device is connected/disconnected
during a session. Cakewalk will offer to add the devices, or reroute outputs to an available device.

 Show Tooltips. Checking this option causes Cakewalk to show tooltips. Tooltips are small text names or explanations that
appear when you hold the mouse over a tool.

 Show MIDI Activity on Windows Taskbar. Check this option to display the MIDI Input/Output Activity icon on the Windows
taskbar.

1710
Preferences dialog

 Display All Times as SMPTE. This option, when checked, forces all time displays to appear in SMPTE time regardless of the
setting you have in the Time Ruler.

 Display Left on Top for MIDI Pan Envelopes. When checked, left is at the top of a clip for MIDI pan envelopes.
 Display Channels as Prefix in Port Menus. When checked, audio and instrument port channels are shown as a prefix in port
menus. When disabled, channels are shown as a suffix in port menus. Channel information is always shown in menus, except for
hardware ports when using friendly names.

 Display Envelopes on Percentage Scale. This option, when checked, causes new envelopes to be placed in the clip based on
a range where 0 dB is in the middle of the clip. If the current volume is other than 0 dB, a new envelope is created at that location.
For example a new envelope created at 6 dB would appear at the very top of the clip where a new envelope created at -20 dB
would appear near the bottom of the clip.

 Display Waveform Preview While Recording. This option (on by default), when checked, causes Cakewalk to draw a preview
waveform of any audio data that you record while you are recording it. If you turn this option off, Cakewalk creates a red swath in
the Clips pane in the area you are recording, while you are recording.

 Display Clip Fade/Envelope Attenuation. This option causes waveforms to respond to clip fades and clip gain/pan automation
envelopes.

 Enable X-Ray. Enable this check box to turn on the X-Ray Windows feature, which allows you to see through plug-in windows
and certain view windows to work in the window behind the current window. You use the X-Ray Windows feature by pressing a
hotkey while the mouse is over an X-Rayable window.
In addition to choosing hotkeys (Edit > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts), you can set these X-Ray Windows options:

 Opacity. Choose how transparent you want the X-Rayed window to become when it is X-Rayed.
 Fade Out Time (Milliseconds). Choose how fast you want the X-Rayed window to reach its maximum transparency.
 Fade In Time (Milliseconds). Choose how fast you want the X-Rayed window to restore its normal state.
 Base Octave for Pitches. There is no industry standard for numbering octaves. By default, Cakewalk calls MIDI note 0 (the
lowest possible note) C0. The Yamaha FB-01, for example, shows MIDI note 0 as C-2 (C negative 2). To match Cakewalk to that
standard, set Base Octave to –2.

The Editing section lets you specify drag & drop behavior, auto-crossfade settings, MIDI editing options and Microscope settings.
The Editing section contains the following settings:

Drag and Drop
Choose from the following drag and drop options:

 Copy Entire Clips as Linked Clips. When you copy an entire clip, choosing this option causes the new clip and the clip that
you copied it from to be “Linked clips” on page 1912.

What to do with existing material
The fields in this section deal with the situation that occurs when you try to drag some data to a place in a track that already has
some data.

 Blend Old and New. Choosing this option tells Cakewalk to mix the new data with the old, with the following option:
 Replace Old with New. Choosing this option tells Cakewalk to delete the old data, with the following option:
 Delete Whole Measures. Choosing this option tells Cakewalk to delete the old data up to the next measure line, regardless
of whether the new data fills the space up to the next measure.

1728
Preferences dialog

 Slide Over Old to Make Room. Choosing this option tells Cakewalk to slide the old data either forward or backward in the track
to make room for the new data. with the following option:

 Align to Measures. Choosing this option tells Cakewalk to slide the old data up to the next measure line, regardless of
whether the new data fills the space up to the next measure.

 Ask Every Time. Choosing this option causes the Editing section to appear every time you drag some data.
Clips
Choose from these clip editing options:

 Selection after single split. This list lets you specify what is selected after a clip is split into two parts:
 Left portion (default). Only the left portion is selected.
 Right portion. Only the right portion is selected.
 Both portions. Both the left and right portions are selected.
 None. Neither portion is selected.
 When Splitting Clips in Groups, Create New Groups. Choosing this option tells Cakewalk to create a new clip group when
splitting clips in an existing clip group.

 Auto Crossfade Comps (0-25ms). Specify the default auto crossfade duration when comping in Take lanes.
MIDI
 Non-Destructive MIDI Editing. Select this option to make all MIDI editing non-destructive. When toggled on, this option forces
deleted data to be retained even though it is not visible.

 Split MIDI Notes. Select this option to split any underlying MIDI notes when you split clips, and insert MIDI chase events (such
as continuous controllers, Pitch Wheel, and Patch Change) at the split position.

 Velocity Audition. Select this option if you want to hear the changes in velocity as you make them.
 Polyphonic Velocity Audition. Select this option if you want to hear all selected notes as you drag them through different
pitch levels.

 Microscope. Use this check box to enable/disable Microscope mode in the Piano Roll view and Inline Piano Roll (enabled by
default).

 Diagonal Size. Use this numeric entry box to specify the diameter size in pixels of the microscope. The valid range is 20250 and the default value is 100.

Customization - Keyboard Shortcuts (Advanced)
Figure 646. The Keyboard Shortcuts section.

Key bindings let you associate Cakewalk commands with keys on your MIDI or computer keyboard. This makes it easy for you to
access specific features more quickly and efficiently.
The Keyboard Shortcuts section lets you specify which keys and key combinations to use for specific Cakewalk commands.
The Keyboard Shortcuts section contains the following settings:

Type of Keys
Use these options to choose what kind of keys will trigger selected Cakewalk commands:

 Computer. Links computer keyboard commands to specific Cakewalk commands.
 MIDI. Links MIDI keyboard commands to specific Cakewalk commands. The Enabled check box must be checked for MIDI
keys to function.

MIDI ‘Shift’ Options
You can designate a MIDI Key or Controller (usually a pedal) to act as a key binding shift key. That way you can require that the key
binding shift key be depressed before any command is triggered, so you only lose one note or pedal from its regular function.
Use these options to choose what acts as the key binding shift key:

 Key. Clicking this option makes a key on your MIDI keyboard act as a key binding shift key. Choose which key by clicking the +
or - buttons in the window that’s just to the right of the Key button.

 Controller. Clicking this option makes a controller on your MIDI keyboard act as a key binding shift key. Choose which controller
(usually the sustain pedal) by choosing one from the drop-down list that’s just to the right of the Controller button.

1731
Preferences dialog

Key Bindings
The Key Bindings field has three lists, a button, and a line of text in it:

 Key. Use this window to highlight a key that you want to bind to a command in the Function list. If a key or combination is
already bound to a global command by default, the name of the key appears in bold text, and the command it is bound to appears
at the bottom of the dialog box under Assigned to. Binding a key or combination to a command and clicking OK overwrites any
default binding for that key or combination.

 Function. Use this window to choose a command to bind to a highlighted key in the Key list.
 Area. Use this window to choose in what context you want the key binding to work.
 Search. The search filter allows you to only show key binding functions that includes a specific text string in the name.

Quantize dialog
When you use the Process > Quantize command, the Quantize dialog box appears. Quantize has two different forms.

 Process > Quantize. This is the standard quantizing command that adjusts the start time and duration of selected notes so that
they line up with a fixed size grid.

 Process > Groove Quantize. This command extracts a grid or “groove” from an existing piece of music (the “groove pattern”),
and then applies it to another piece of music to produce a similar rhythmic feel.
Use the following fields in the Quantize dialog box to control standard quantizing:

Preset menu
Save or select settings that you use often in the drop-down menu. To save a new group of settings, type a name into the menu, and
click the Save button. To delete a group, select it and click the Delete button.

Resolution
Set the note resolution. The smaller the note value, the more precise the quantization. See “Resolution” on page 870.

Change
 MIDI Event Start Times. Select this option if you want the start times of the MIDI events in the selected data to move.
 Note Durations. Select this option if you want the length of notes to be edited to fit into the size you chose in the Resolution
field.

 AudioSnap Beats. Select this option if you want AudioSnap transients to move.
 Audio Clip Start Times. Select this option if you want the beginnings of audio clips to move.
 Only Notes, Lyrics, and Audio. If you select this option, Cakewalk will not modify other events, like controllers.
Options:
 Strength. This value determines how closely Cakewalk moves the selected notes to the resolution value, or “grid.” See
“Strength” on page 871.

 Swing. Use this value to make groups of even eighth notes (or whatever note you want to enter in the Resolution field) “swing,”
instead of playing with exact eighth note rhythm. A value of 50 percent, or “50-50,” produces equal durations for both notes—no
swing. A larger value makes the first note longer, and vice versa. See “Swing” on page 871.

 Window. This value determines whether Cakewalk quantizes notes that are far from the quantization points, or leaves them
alone. A value of 100 percent quantizes every note. See “Window” on page 872.

 Offset. This value moves the quantization grid forward or backward in the track, away from the beat boundaries. See “Offset” on
page 871.

 Auto XFade Audio Clips. This option becomes available if you enable the Audio Clip Start Times check box. If you enable
this option, and the process of quantizing audio clips results in overlapping clips or gaps between clips, a crossfade is
automatically added to the overlapping or empty area. You specify the length of the crossfade in XFade field. The Max Gap value
specifies the widest gap that will be filled with an automatic crossfade.

Regenerate Tablature dialog
Click the Staff view Edit menu and choose Regenerate TAB to open the Regenerate Tablature dialog box.
The Regenerate TAB command works on selected regions in a track to modify the fingering according to the method you choose.
The TAB display by default uses the ‘floating’ algorithm which analyzes all events in a track and attempts to optimize tablature with
reference to open position. By choosing the “fixed” algorithm instead, you can designate a specific finger span and lowest fret which
causes the TAB of a selected region to be displayed within this range. This usually creates a more compact fingering system.
The Regenerate Tablature dialog box has the following fields:

Track
This window displays the names of all selected tracks. Highlight the one you want to regenerate TAB for.

Method
Choose what TAB style you want Cakewalk to use, from these options:

 Fixed. This style specifies where on the neck these notes should be played. When Fixed is selected the Finger span and
Lowest fret fields are used together to define the “box” where the notes are displayed. The Finger span parameter determines
how many consecutive frets will be used to display the note. For example, if Finger span is set to 4, then Cakewalk will attempt to
place all the notes within those 4 frets. The Lowest Fret then determines where on the fretboard will the notes be displayed within
the Finger span. The red box in the fretboard display above the parameters changes to reflect the settings in these two
parameters.

 Floating. This style analyzes all events in a track and attempts to optimize tablature with reference to open position
 MIDI Channel. This style uses the event’s MIDI channel to determine which string the note should be displayed on. When MIDI
Channel is selected, the user chooses which series of MIDI Channels Cakewalk receives on. This is useful for MIDI guitarists who
record parts in MONO mode, where each string transmits on a different MIDI channel. (Values: 1 - 11). Selecting “1” will cause it
to use MIDI channels 1 - 6, selecting 2, 2 - 7, and so on.

Finger Span
The value in this field determines the finger or fret span the new TAB covers. Usually, you set this value to 4.

Lowest Fret
The value in this field determines the lowest fret the TAB can use for the selected notes.

1st Channel
The value in this field determines the first MIDI channel of six consecutive channels that Cakewalk assigns notes to, depending on
which strings you play the notes on.

Number of Frets
This value is determined in the Staff View Layout dialog box, and governs how many frets Cakewalk’s Fretboard can display.

Skip Channel 10 (G50)
This check box is grayed out unless you choose MIDI Channel in the Method field. If you use a MIDI converter like the G50, Channel
10 is reserved for percussion instruments, so if you use a MIDI guitar to transmit on six consecutive MIDI channels, select this check
box to avoid using Channel 10 for your guitar.

Remote Control dialog
When you right-click a control in the Console or Track views and choose Remote Control from the pop-up menu, the Remote
Control dialog box appears. This dialog box lets you use a MIDI device as a remote control for knobs, buttons, and sliders in
Cakewalk, and has the following fields:

Channel Messages
The buttons in this section control command that are specific to individual MIDI channels. The options are:

 Note On. With this button enabled, the selected control’s value alternates between its minimum and maximum values every
time you play the note that’s listed in the Note On field. If the selected control is a button, it toggles between on and off position.

 Note On/Off. With this button enabled, the selected control’s value is maximized when the note that’s listed in this field is
depressed, and minimized when the note is released. If the selected control is a button, it toggles between on and off position.

 Controller. With this button enabled and a Controller number entered in the Number field, Cakewalk “listens” for a controller
message that your MIDI controller is sending, and the selected control moves up or down as the controller message’s value gets
larger or smaller. For example, if your MIDI controller can send MIDI volume data from one of its faders or controls, and you set a
fader in Cakewalk to respond to Controller #7, the selected fader in Cakewalk will move up or down as the value of Controller #7
that your MIDI controller sends rises or falls.

 Wheel. With this button enabled, the selected control moves as the pitch wheel on your MIDI controller moves.
 RPN. If your MIDI controller can send RPN data, enabling this button causes the selected control to move as the RPN data that
your MIDI controller changes.

 NRPN. If your MIDI controller can send NRPN data, enabling this button causes the selected control to move as the NRPN data
that your MIDI controller changes.

 MIDI Channel. Use this field to tell Cakewalk which MIDI channel the controller data comes in on.
Learn button
If you don’t know what controller number a slider or knob on your MIDI controller sends, just click the Learn button and then move
the knob in question. Cakewalk reads the incoming MIDI data and automatically configures the Remote Control settings so that the
controller you moved now controls the Cakewalk control that you are configuring.

Sysx
You can use this option to control Cakewalk’s Console from an external controller that sends sysx, such as the Tascam 428, or any
device that sends sysx data. You can set the selected control in Cakewalk to respond to sysx data by using these fields:

 Single Byte. Checking this option tells Cakewalk that the significant data (the variable, or parameter value) in the incoming sysx
message is in the form of a single byte.

 High byte first. Checking this option tells Cakewalk that the significant data in the incoming sysx message is in the form of two
bytes, with the high byte first.

 Low byte first. Checking this option tells Cakewalk that the significant data in the incoming sysx message is in the form of two
bytes, with the low byte first.

 Starts with. Fill in the string that your device sends in sysx messages that precedes the significant data.
 Ends with. Fill in the string that your device sends in sysx messages that follows the significant data.
Note: If you set up remote control for a grouped control, the remote control works all controls in the group.

Remove DC Offset dialog
The Process > Apply Effect > Remove DC Offset command opens the Remove DC Options dialog box, which allows you to
remove audio artifacts cause by electrical mismatches between recording hardware and input instruments or devices. This dialog
box has the following fields:

 DC Offset Threshold (dB). You can set a minimum dB threshold. If the analyzed DC offset is below this value, no removal
takes place.

 Analyze Left Channel (dB) and Right Channel (dB). This field displays the DC offset separately for the left and right channels.
Press the Audition button to update the display.

 Compute DC Offset from first 5 seconds only. To speed processing, select the Compute DC offset from first 5 seconds only
check box. Only the first five seconds of a sound file will be analyzed when measuring the DC offset. The only time that five
seconds is not sufficient is if a long fade-in or mute has been applied at the beginning of the file.

Remove Silence dialog
When you use the Process > Apply Effect > Remove Silence command, or click the Gate Settings button in the Freeze Options
dialog box, the Remove Silence dialog box appears. This command creates absolute silence during silent passages, eliminating
extraneous noise.
The Remove Silence dialog box has the following fields:

Preset field (only appears with Process Audio command)
Use this field to choose and enter presets. Click the Save button to save any group of new settings after you enter a name in the
Preset field. Click the Delete button to delete any selected group from the Preset field.

Open Level (db)
The value in this field is how loud the sound must get (the loudness threshold) before Cakewalk stops silencing the sound. The gate
“officially” opens when loudness rises above this level, although it can open earlier because of the Attack Time (see Attack Time).

Close Level (db)
The value in this field is how soft the sound must get (the softness threshold) before Cakewalk starts silencing the sound. The gate
“officially” closes when loudness falls below this level, although it can stay open later because of the Release Time (see Release
Time).

Attack Time (ms)
The value in this field is the interval of time after the volume reaches the Open Level for the gate to fully open. Opening the gate
gradually produces a fade-in effect instead of an instant on-off sound.

Hold Time (ms)
The value in this field is the minimum time for the gate to stay open. Hold Time is useful when you've set high open and close
levels—for example, when your source signal is very loud. Noise gates set this way tend to react to repeated percussive passages
(such as drum rolls) by repeatedly opening and closing; this can sound unpleasant. By setting a hold time, you can ensure that the
gate stays open long enough during percussive passages.

Look Ahead (ms)
The value in this field causes the gate to open slightly before the sound reaches the Open Level so you don’t lose the sound’s
attack.

Release Time (ms)
The value in this field is the interval of time after the volume reaches the Close Level before the gate actually closes. This lets the
tail end of sounds pass through without being clipped.

Retain Cakewalk Preferences dialog
If you choose to retain or migrate your preferences from a previous version of Cakewalk, the Cakewalk installer finds the existing
Cakewalk.ini files on your system. The list of Cakewalk.ini files appears in the Retain Cakewalk Preferences dialog box. You
may choose one from this list. The preferences and settings stored in the older version's Cakewalk.ini and TTSseq.ini files are
then transferred to the identically named configuration files for Cakewalk. Cakewalk migrates certain preferences to the Windows
Registry rather than to the Cakewalk.ini file.
When you migrate your preferences, Cakewalk will:
1. Locate the Data directory (WaveData folder) used by your previous Cakewalk installations and direct Cakewalk to use that folder
for its audio storage and retrieval as well.
Note: Migrating Preferences will leave the Data directory in its current location - it does not move your audio recordings to a
new location. It simply points Cakewalk to the audio you have saved during previous recording sessions. This means that your
previously recorded songs that contain audio tracks should continue to open and playback as expected. It will also write new
audio data to this same location. You are free to manually change your Data directory at a later time in Cakewalk's Options,
Audio, Advanced tab. Advanced users may want to manually adjust this Data directory location.
2. Automatically import any custom Instrument Definitions you used in your previous Cakewalk version.
3. Automatically import other custom settings you have made in various Cakewalk menus and INI files.

Revert dialog
The File > Revert command opens the Revert dialog box, which lets you open an earlier version of the current project. Click the
version of the file that you want to open. If you then save the earlier version, it becomes than latest version. To use the Revert
feature, file versioning must be enabled in Edit > Preferences > File - Advanced.

Safe Mode dialog
Opening a file in safe mode opens the safe mode dialog box, which asks you, one plug-in at a time, which of the file’s plug-ins to
open each. If you think one of the plug-ins is preventing the file from opening, choose not to load that plug-in. You can also try
loading only one plug-in, closing the file, and then loading 2 plug-ins the next time you open the file, etc., until you isolate the bad
plug-in.
Note: Safe mode is activated when you open a file while the SHIFT key is pressed.

Save As dialog
The File > Save As command opens the Save As dialog box, which lets you save a project with the name, directory, and format you
specify. The Save As dialog box can also be used to save Groove clips as Riff Wave files from the Loop Construction view. Use the
following fields to control your options:

Save in
Select the directory in which you want to store the file.

File name
Type or select the filename you want to open.

Save as type
Select the type of file you want to save your project as. If you are saving a project, you have the following options:

 Normal. Saving as type Normal saves your MIDI data, all project settings, and references to your audio data, with the extension
.cwp. Cakewalk saves no audio data in a .cwp file, only references to where the data is on the hard disk. Saving your project as a
bundle file saves all your project data in one place, including a new copy of your audio data; this method uses a lot more disk
space than saving as a .cwp file.

 Template. Template file with the extension .cwt. Use Template files to save commonly used project settings for quickly setting
up a new project.

 Cakewalk Bundle. Bundle file with the extension .cwb. Bundle files contain everything that a Normal file type contains with the
addition of all your project's audio. Bundle files are great for backing up projects, and are also useful for moving Cakewalk
projects from one computer to another.

 MIDI Format 0. Save in this format to create a Standard MIDI File that has all channels merged into one track.
 MIDI Format 1. Save in this format to create a Standard MIDI File that keeps each channel on a separate track.
 Riff MIDI Format 0. Save in this format if you need a Riff MIDI File of Format 0.
 Riff MIDI Format 1. Save in this format if you need a Riff MIDI File of Format 1.
Riff Wave files. If you are saving in the Loop Construction view, you can save the wave file as a Groove Clip/Wave file or a regular
Wave file, depending on whether you enabled looping on the clip that you’re saving. Groove Clip/Wave files are ACID-compatible
files which can be used in Cakewalk or any application that supports ACIDized files.

Go to Folder (Project saves only)
The Go to folder drop-down lets you quickly go to the default save location for different types of projects.

Copy all audio with project (Project saves only)
When selected, this check box creates a copy of every audio file your project references, regardless of where they are located, and
stores them in a folder called Audio Data. The Audio Data folder is created in the folder where you save your project. For example, if
you save your project to the following folder:
C:\My Project
Your project’s audio is saved in the following folder:
C:\My Project\Audio Data
If you want to give the Audio Data folder a different name, you can do so using the Audio path option. See “Audio path (Project
saves only)” on page 1745.

Create one file per clip (Project saves only)
This option is only available if the Copy all audio with project option is selected. When selected, the Create one file per clip
option forces Cakewalk to create a new wave file for each unique clip. To conserve disk space, Cakewalk does not duplicate audio
referenced by multiple copies of a clip.

Audio path (Project saves only)
If you want to customize the name of the folder in which you store your audio files, specify it in this field. You can use the Browse
button to specify where the folder is saved.

Save Pattern dialog

Scale Velocity dialog
The Process > Scale Velocity command opens the Scale Velocity dialog box, which lets you edit MIDI clips to create crescendos
(volume swells) and decrescendos on those instruments that respond to MIDI velocity. Most MIDI instruments map changes in
velocity to changes in note loudness. Many synthesizer patches alter the timbre of the sound as well, so that higher velocities
produce brighter, as well as louder, sounds.
This command lets you set a starting and ending velocity for the entire time range of the selection. Cakewalk scales the velocity of
each event to create a smooth linear change in velocity. As an option, you can enter a starting and ending percentage; Cakewalk
modifies existing velocity values by the designated percentage.
You can also edit note velocities in the Notes pane of the Piano Roll view, which lets you draw shapes other than straight line
changes. For more information, see “Adding and editing controllers in the Piano Roll” on page 843.
The Scale Velocity dialog box has the following fields:

Begin
Enter a velocity value between 0 and 127 for the first event of the selection, unless you want to use percentages. If you use
percentages, enter a number between 0 and the approximate percentage that would create a velocity of 127, when multiplied by the
existing velocity of the first event. Cakewalk rounds off any values you create above 127 to 127.

End
Enter a velocity value between 0 and 127 for the last event of the selection, unless you want to use percentages. If you use
percentages, enter a number between 0 and the approximate percentage that would create a velocity of 127, when multiplied by the
existing velocity of the last event. Cakewalk rounds off any values you create above 127 to 127.

Percentages
Select this check box if you want to modify existing velocities by a percentage.
See also:
“To scale velocities” on page 869.

Search for Missing Audio dialog
Open the Search for Missing Audio dialog by clicking the Search button in the Find Missing Audio dialog box.
The Search for Missing Audio dialog box searches your entire computer for a file that has the same name as the missing file in
your project. If the file is found, select it and click OK. If multiple copies of the same file name are found, you may select only one. If
no files are found, manually search your Recycle Bin. If you find the missing file in the Recycle Bin, right-click on it and select
Restore to return the file to your project’s audio data directory.

Select By Time dialog
The Edit > Select > By Time command opens the Select by Time dialog box.
Choose the starting and ending times for the time selection you want to make by entering numbers into the following fields:

 From. Enter the number of the measure, beat, and tick of the location where you want the selection to start.
Note: You can enter a whole number with no punctuation if your selection boundary is the beginning of a measure. You can
separate measure, beat, and tick numbers with spaces, periods, or colons.

 Thru. Enter the number of the measure, beat, and tick of the location where you want the selection to end.
The From and Thru times you select appear in the Select toolbar in the From and Thru fields. If you select a whole measure, the
Thru time is the start of the next measure, which actually makes it a “to” time and not a “through” time.

Split Clips dialog
When you right-click one or more selected clips and choose Split from the pop-up menu, the Split Clips dialog box appears. Use
this command to split one or more clips into smaller clips.
The Split Clips dialog box has the following fields:

Split At Time
Choosing this option splits the clip(s) at the location you fill in. By default, this filed lists the Now time, but you can choose any time
you want.
Time Format.

If you choose Split At Time, you can also select a time format for the Split At Time field from the four choices.

Split At Selection
Choosing this option splits the clip(s) at the boundaries of the selected area. If you’re splitting a MIDI clip, the split will not split any
notes, so the split may not happen exactly where your selection boundary is.

Split Repeatedly/Starting at Measure/And Again Every “N” Measures
Choosing this option creates split boundaries in the selected clip(s) starting at the location you choose in the Starting at Measure
field, and again at every interval of measures that you choose in the And Again Every “N” Measures field.

Split at Each Marker Time
Choosing this option creates split boundaries in the selected clip(s) at each marker time.

Split When Silent For At Least “N” Measures
Choosing this option separates the selected clip(s) and removes empty space whenever the clips contain empty space that lasts a
certain number of measures, the number of which you specify in the “N” field.

Use Nondestructive Cropping When Splitting MIDI Clips
If you check this option, Cakewalk hides any MIDI data (such as note durations) that overlap the clip boundary, without deleting any
data. If you slip edit the new clip to expand the original boundary, Cakewalk uncovers the original data. If you don’t check this option,
Cakewalk deletes overlapping data when you split clips.

Split MIDI Notes
Choosing this option splits any underlying MIDI notes at the split boundaries, and inserts MIDI chase events (such as continuous
controllers, Pitch Wheel, and Patch Change) at the split position.
Note that the Undo and Redo commands work with all of these editing commands.

Tablature Settings dialog
In the Staff View Layout dialog box you can choose a preset style of tablature by choosing from the Preset pop-up menu, or you
can define your own style by clicking the Define button in the Staff View Layout dialog box to open the Tablature Settings dialog
box.
Use the following fields in the Tablature Settings dialog box to configure TAB for a selected track:

Preset
Save your settings by typing a name into the Preset field at the top of the dialog box and clicking the disk icon next to it. You can
remove presets from the list by clicking the X button next to the disk icon.
The next time you want to use these settings for a track, choose your Preset in the Staff View Layout dialog box from the Presets
drop-down list.

Tablature
The Tablature tab has these fields:

 Method. Choose a tablature method from the Method drop-down list. There are three methods to determine how the TAB is
displayed:

 Floating. Analyzes all events in a track and attempts to optimize tablature with reference to open position
 Fixed. This specifies where on the neck these notes should be played. When Fixed is selected, the Finger span and
Lowest fret fields are used together to define the “box” where the notes are displayed. The Finger span parameter
determines how many consecutive frets will be used to display the note. For example, if Finger span is set to 4, then Cakewalk
will attempt to place all the notes within those 4 frets. The Lowest Fret then determines where on the fretboard will the notes
be displayed within the Finger span. The red box in the fretboard display above the parameters changes to reflect the settings
in these two parameters.

 MIDI Channel. This uses the event’s MIDI channel to determine which string the note should be displayed on. This is useful
for MIDI guitarists who record parts in MONO mode, where each string transmits on a different MIDI channel. When MIDI
Channel is selected, the user chooses which series of MIDI Channels Cakewalk receives on by typing a number into the 1st
Channel field (use values between 1 - 11). Selecting 1 will cause it to use MIDI channels 1 - 6, selecting 2, 2 - 7, and so on.
Checking the Skip Channel 10 (G50) check box tells Cakewalk that your guitar is not transmitting on channel l0, so Cakewalk
has to use other channels to display your data.

 Number of Frets. The number in this field determines how many frets the instrument has that you want to generate a TAB
for.

 String Tuning. Choose the instrument from the drop-down list and number of strings from the Number of Strings field.
The open string pitches for the instrument you choose automatically appear in the string number fields at the bottom of the dialog
box.
Customize any of the open string pitches by using the + or - buttons on the String Number fields.

Fretboard
The Fretboard tab has these fields:

 Texture. Choose a texture from the drop-down list.
 Orientation. If you want to reverse the standard string orientation, click Low String on Top (Mirror).
Both the Staff View Layout dialog box and the Tablature Settings dialog box create tablature settings for a whole track at a time.
To modify tablature for selected parts of a track, select part of a track and use the “Regenerate TAB” on page 1296 command.

Track Manager dialog

Transpose dialog
The Process > Transpose command opens the Transpose dialog box, which allows you to transpose the pitches of MIDI and
audio clips up or down by a fixed number of half-steps. It does so by changing the MIDI key numbers of note events and by pitchshifting audio clips. Simply enter the number of half-steps in the Amount field of the Transpose dialog box; a negative number to
transpose down, a positive number to transpose up. See “To transpose selected events” on page 863.
Cakewalk can also perform diatonic transposition, which shifts all the notes up and down the major scale of the current signature by
the designated number of steps. For instance, if you specify an amount of +1 and the key signature is C-major, a C becomes a D (up
a whole step), an E becomes an F (up a half step), and so on. Diatonic transposition assures you that the transposed notes fit with
the original key signature.
As an option, you can choose to transpose selected audio clips along with any selected MIDI clips. Cakewalk uses pitch-shifting to
perform the transposition. You can transpose audio only a single octave in either direction (-12 to +12), and you cannot transpose
audio when you are using diatonic transposition.
The Transpose dialog box contains the following fields:

Amount
The number in this field tells Cakewalk how many half-steps, up or down (depending on whether you enter a positive or negative
number), to transpose the selected data, unless you select the Diatonic Math check box. If you select the Diatonic Math check box,
the number in this field tells Cakewalk how many scale steps to transpose the selected data.

Diatonic Math
If you select this check box. Cakewalk transposes the selected data up or down, but only within the current key signature.

Transpose Audio
If you select this check box. Cakewalk transposes any selected audio data up or down, but only by half-steps, not diatonically.

 Type. Choose the type of audio data you’re transposing.

Undo History dialog
The Edit > History command opens the Undo History dialog box, which displays a history of your editing actions (the command is
grayed-out if you made no edits). You can set how many editing actions you want the Undo History dialog box to store by changing
the number in the Maximum Undo Steps field. The default value is 128.
Use the Undo History dialog box to jump to a previous time in the history of the project. Then you can continue from that point,
causing all the edits you did after that action to disappear.
The Undo History dialog box has the following fields:

History list
The History list displays a list of all the editing actions you did to this project, up to the number of actions in the Maximum Undo
Steps field.
To revert to an earlier version of a project, highlight the entry in the History list that represents the point to which you'd like to return,
and click OK. Cakewalk performs the necessary undo or redo actions to take you to that point. Once you make any new edits,
Cakewalk clears the History list of all the edits you made after the edit you jumped back to. Then, as you do further work, the History
list grows again. Any edits that happened after the edit you jumped back to remain on the list.

Clear button
You can click the Clear button in the Undo History dialog box to erase the undo history for the current project and free up some
memory. If Cakewalk is low on memory, it may offer to erase the History list.

Maximum Undo Levels
This field lists the number of previous edits that Cakewalk stores. The default value is 128. You can enter a smaller number to
reduce the memory required.
See also:
“Undo, redo, and the undo history” on page 553

Unlink Clips dialog
When you right-click a selected group of two or more linked clips and choose Unlink from the pop-up menu, the Unlink Clips dialog
box appears.
This command lets you specify when unlinking selected linked clips whether to form a new, different linked group or to make the clips
completely independent.

Unpack Bundle dialog
The Unpack Bundle dialog box allows you specify the folder where you want to store the unpacked project and the folder where you
want to store the project’s audio data.

Project Name
Enter a file name for your project. The default name is the same as the bundle filename but with the .cwp extension.

Location
Select a folder in which your project file is saved.

Audio Path
Select a folder in which your project’s audio data is stored.

Create One File per Clip
Check this option to create a separate wave file for each clip in your project. If you uncheck this option, all audio is stored in two
wave files, a mono file with all the project’s mono audio, and a stereo file with all the projects stereo audio.

Unpack OMF dialog
The Unpack OMF dialog box appears when you open an OMF file.
Note: When you import an OMF that uses embedded media, Cakewalk can determine the bit depth and sample rate of the
embedded media, and it will set those fields as the default values for OMF import. If the OMF is using externally linked media,
Cakewalk will not be able to determine the sample rate of the media and will default to a 44,100 sample rate. In this case it is
desirable to know the sample rate of the original material so the import OMF settings can be set to avoid resampling the media,
if resampling is not desired.
Select from the following unpack options:

Sample Rate
This field displays the sample rate that the imported audio uses if you’re using embedded media; if you’re using externally linked
media, this field defaults to 44,100. You can change the sample rate by choosing one of the sample rates listed in the drop-down
menu.

Bit Depth
This field displays the bit depth that the imported audio uses if you’re using embedded media; if you’re using externally linked media,
this field defaults to the Original menu option in the drop-down menu, which leaves the bit depth of the imported audio in its original
depth. You can change the bit depth during import by choosing one of the listed options.

Initial Tempo
Set the initial tempo of the file.

Store Project Audio in its own Folder
If you want to use a unique folder for this project’s audio data, check this option and fill out the Project Name, Location and Audio
Path fields. If you deselect this option, the project is saved with the same file name to the default directory using the default audio
directory. The file’s new extension is .cwp.

1759
Unpack Bundle dialog

Project Name
The Project filename. This field is only active if you have checked the Store Project Audio in its own Folder option.

Location
The directory where you want to save the project. This field is only active if you have checked the Store Project Audio in its own
Folder option.

Audio Path
The audio directory where you want to store the audio for the project. This field is only active if you have checked the Store Project
Audio in its own Folder option.

Unreadable Files dialog
This dialog box may appear when using the Clean Audio Folder command. This dialog box lists any files on your system which
have a Cakewalk file extension (.cwp, .cwt, .wrk, and .tpl), but cannot be read by Cakewalk. These files may be corrupt or they may
not be Cakewalk files at all, if for instance you have another application on your system which saves files with the same extension.
Important: If any of your projects appears in this dialog box, do not proceed to delete any audio in the Clean Audio Folder
dialog box without first restoring these projects from a backup source such as a Bundle file (.cwb). If Cakewalk cannot read a
project file, any audio associated with it will be listed in the Clean Audio Folder dialog box.

Video Export dialog
Cakewalk can combine an inserted video file with the audio tracks you record in a project to form a new AVI, Windows Media Video,
or QuickTime file. You can also save to an external FireWire device. Choosing the File > Export > Video command opens the Video
Export dialog box, which offers the following options:

 Save in. Choose the folder you want to store your new video file in.
 File name. Fill in a name for your new file.
 Save As Type. Choose Video for Windows (AVI), Windows Media Video, or QuickTime. If you have an external FireWire device
connected, you can choose AVC Compliant Device, or whatever your device is named. See “Exporting a project to a FireWire DV
device” on page 342 for more information.

Video Properties dialog
Right-clicking a video in the Video view and choosing Video Properties from the pop-up menu opens the Video Properties dialog
box. This dialog box has three tabs—the Video Settings tab, the Info tab, and the Render Quality tab.

Video Settings tab
The Video Settings tab lets you set playback time options, and has the following fields:

 Clip. This field lists the name of the currently-loaded video file.
 Start Time. If you don’t want the video to start playing until some later time in the audio project, fill in the time that you do want
the video to start. For example, if you want the beginning of your video to start playing at measure 3 of your audio project, enter 3
in the Start Time field.
Note: Adjusting a video clip’s start time is currently only supported when using the DirectShow video engine, not when using
the Media Foundation video engine. For information about changing the video engine, see “To specify the default video engine”
on page 341.

 Trim-in Time. If you don’t want your video to start playing right at the beginning of the video file, enter the time in the video file
(in “SMPTE” on page 1915 format) where you want the video to start playing. For example, if your video has 10 seconds of blank
video at the front of the file, you can enter 00:00:10:00 into the Trim-in Time field, and Cakewalk skips the first 10 seconds of the
video file and starts playing your video file at the 10 second mark in the video.

 Trim-out Time. If you have blank or unwanted video at the end of your video file, enter the time (in SMPTE format) where you
want to stop playing the video.

Info tab
The Info tab displays various attributes of the inserted video, and also contains the More button, which displays a more extensive set
of attributes.

Render Quality tab
The Render Quality tab lets you control how your video looks in Cakewalk. It doesn’t affect the video that you eventually export,
although you can experiment with different settings to get an idea of how your video looks at different sizes and with different frame
rates.
The Render Quality tab has the following controls:

 Preview check box. Select this check box to cause the video in Cakewalk to display at a slightly lower quality: “preview” quality.
This can cause slightly smoother playback.

 Frame Rate (FPS). Use this field to change the frame rate. Lower frame rates free some of your computer’s resources for
playing back music and other tasks.

 Video Size, X and Y. The X field sets the video’s width, in pixels; the Y field sets height.
 Restore Defaults. Click this button to set the three previous fields (including Preview) back to their default values.
Note: The Render Quality settings are currently only supported when using the DirectShow video engine, not when using the
Media Foundation video engine. For information about changing the video engine, see “To specify the default video engine” on
page 341.

WMV Encoder Options dialog
Clicking the Encoding Options button in the Video Export dialog box after you’ve selected Windows Media Video in the Save As
Type field opens the WMV Encoder Options dialog box.
This dialog box has the following fields:

 Profile. This field has a list of common WMV video file formats. Selecting a profile tells the WMV encoder what quality of file to
produce.

 Profile info. This field briefly explains the kind of video and audio file that the profile you selected will produce.
 Title/Author/Rating/Copyright/Description. Filling in these fields will fill in the information your file will generate when you
open the file’s Properties dialog box from Windows Media Player.

 Multipass. If you’re creating a Variable Bit Rate (VBS) video, the file quality will improve some if you tell the encoder to go
through your source material twice (make two passes at it).

Windows Media Video (WMV) profiles
Cakewalk includes several profiles for exporting WMV files. You can author your own WMV profiles if you want to use specific
settings. To do so, you need to download and install the Windows Media Profile Editor, which is included with the Windows Media
Encoder 9 Series.
Download from here:
www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/download
In Select Download choose Windows Media Encoder.

Insert Send Assistant dialog
When you right-click an audio track or bus and choose Insert Send > Insert Send Assistant from the pop-up menu, the Insert
Send Assistant dialog box appears. This dialog box lets you create effect buses and insert sends to new or existing buses.
The Insert Send Assistant dialog box has the following options:
Send to Existing Bus. This option lets you assign a new send to an existing bus in the current project. Select the desired bus from
the drop-down list.
The Options section is unavailable when Send to Existing Bus is selected.
New Stereo Bus. This option lets you assign a new send to a new bus. When selected, you can use the Options section to
specify the bus name and other settings (see “New stereo/surround bus options” on page 1765).
New Surround Bus. This option lets you assign a new send to a new surround bus. When selected, you can use the Options
section to specify the surround bus name and other settings (see “New stereo/surround bus options” on page 1765).

New stereo/surround bus options
When you select New Stereo Bus or New Surround Bus, the following settings can be configured in the Options section:
Bus Name.

Specify the desired name for the new bus. This name will be shown in the Track view and Console view.

Patch Effect. Select the Patch Effect check box if you want to create an effect bus. When selected, click Choose Effect to
choose the desired effect plug-in that will be patched in the new bus.
Choose Effect. This button is only available when Patch Effect is selected. Click the button to choose the desired effect plug-in to
insert on the new bus. When an effect has been selected, the plug-in name is displayed on the button face.
Post Fader (best for effects). When Post Fader is selected, the send signal is taken from after the channel volume fader. As a
result, the send level going to the bus changes when the channel fader changes. Select Post Fader if you want to create an effect
bus. Doing so allows you to maintain a consistent balance between the “wet” and “dry” signals as you adjust the channel fader.
Pre Fader. When Pre Fader is selected, the send signal is taken from before the channel volume fader. As a result, the send level
going to the bus does not change when the channel fader changes. Pre Fader is preferred when you want to create separate mixes,
such as unique headphone mixes for different performers.
Show Effects. This option is only available when Patch Effect is selected. When Show Effects is selected, the chosen effect
plug-in’s user interface (UI) appears when you click OK to close the Insert Send Assistant dialog box.

Silent Buses Detected dialog
When you load a project, Cakewalk checks to see if the exact same output ports are assigned as when the project was saved.
Cakewalk’s port assignments can change if you load the project on a different hardware configuration or change driver models. If
there is any discrepancy between the port assignments that were saved and the ports that are used in the current configuration, the
ports are set to “None” and the Silent Buses Detected dialog box displays all track and bus outputs from the current project that
have been assigned to a silent output.
The Silent Buses Detected dialog box also appears if any track or bus output is assigned to “None” as a result of changing the
audio configuration.

See:
“Step Sequencer view” on page 1802

Matrix Options dialog
When you click the Options button in the Matrix view, Matrix Options dialog box appears. The following options are available:

 Empty cells stop active cells when triggered. This option determines how playing cells are affected when triggering an empty
cell in the same row. If Empty cells stop active cells when triggered is disabled (default), triggering an empty cell has no effect
on other cells. If Empty cells stop active cells when triggered is selected, triggering an empty cell in a row will force the row to
stop playing. Likewise, triggering a column that contains empty cells will force the corresponding row to stop playing. This option
is disabled by default.

 AutoScroll to Column when Triggered by MIDI. This option allows the Matrix view to automatically scroll a column into view if
one of the column’s cells are triggered by MIDI.

 Import all audio as GrooveClips. This option forces all audio to be imported as Groove Clips.

Quantize to AudioSnap Pool dialog

Loop Properties dialog - Audio Stretching
You have two different (and independent) ways to stretch clips: by using either Groove clips or AudioSnap. Groove Clip markers are
typically placed at a zero-crossing point before a transient; AudioSnap markers are placed directly on a transient. The AudioSnap
feature can extract tempo from a clip. Groove Clip stretching is preferred for more extreme stretching. There are numerous other
differences between the two features (see “Working with Groove Clip audio” on page 806, and “AudioSnap” on page 751).
The Audio Stretching tab has a section of options for Groove Clips, and a separate section for AudioSnap, described as follows:

Groove Clips
Both MIDI and audio clips can be set to act as groove clips. The options you see in this dialog box for audio clips are different from
the options for MIDI clips.
The Groove Clips section of the Audio Stretching tab has the following options:

 Enable Looping. Checking the Enable Looping check box allows you to loop clips in the Track view by dragging the right side
of a clip with your mouse. When Enable Looping is not checked, you are able to slip edit the clip. For more information about slip
editing, see “Applying fades and crossfades offline” on page 942.

 Stretch to Project Tempo [audio clips only]. The Stretch to Project Tempo check box instructs Cakewalk to stretch or shrink
the clip to fit the project’s tempo. Cakewalk uses the Beats in Clip and Original Tempo parameters are used to make the change.

 Beats in Clip. The number of beats (quarter notes) in the clip.
 Original Tempo [audio clips only]. The tempo at which the clip was recorded.
 Follow Project Pitch. The Follow Project Pitch option transposes the loop, if necessary, to the key of the project. A loop
recorded in the key of A, used in a project in the key of C, would be transposed up three semitones if the Follow Project Pitch
check box was checked.

 Reference Note. The Reference Note represents the key in which the loop was recorded. The Follow Project Pitch feature uses
this information, when checked, to transpose the loop to match the project’s key.

 Pitch (semitones). You can set the transposition of a clip, independent from the project pitch, using the Pitch (semitones)
field. A positive number transposes the clip up by that number of semitones. A negative number transposes the clip down by that
number of semitones. Remember that, if the Follow Project Pitch option is checked, the clip follows the project’s pitch, so any
transposition changes you make using this option are changes to the project pitch, not the clip pitch.
An example: The project key is C. The clip key is D. If the Follow Project Pitch option is checked, the clip is transposed down by
two semitones. A value entered into the Pitch (semitone) field adjusts the pitch from C. If you enter -1 the pitch would be
transposed down by one additional semitone to B.
Another example: The clip pitch is E. The desired clip pitch is D. If the Follow Project Pitch option is not checked, and a value
of -2 is entered in the Pitch (semitones) field, the clip is transposed down two semitones to D from the original pitch of E.

 Fine Pitch (cents) [audio clips only]. The Fine Pitch (cents) field allows you to make tuning adjustments or to transpose the
pitch of a clip up to 50 cents. There are 100 cents in one semitone. A Fine Pitch setting of 1 adjusts the pitch up one hundredth of
a semitone. The Fine Pitch option can “fine tune” a slightly out of tune clip so that it is in pitch with the remaining clips in a project.

Input Quantize dialog
The Input Quantize dialog box appears after selecting Quantize Settings in the Input Quantize section in the Inspector.
The Input Quantize dialog box contains the following settings:

 Resolution. Set the note resolution in either standard note duration or tick value. The resolution determines the size note or
time value that you want your MIDI data to conform to.

 MIDI Event Start Times. Select this option to quantize MIDI event start times.
 Note Durations. Select this option to quantize Note Event durations to the size of the Resolution value.
 Only Quantize Notes. If selected, Cakewalk will not modify other events, such as controllers.
 Strength. This value determines how closely Cakewalk moves the selected notes to the resolution value, or “grid”. See
“Strength” on page 871.

 Swing. Use this value to make groups of even eighth notes (or whatever note you want to enter in the Resolution field) “swing”,
instead of playing with exact eighth note rhythm. A value of 50 percent, or “50-50”, produces equal durations for both notes—no
swing. A larger value makes the first note longer, and vice versa. See “Swing” on page 871.

 Window. This value determines whether Cakewalk quantizes notes that are far from the quantization points, or leaves them
alone. A value of 100 percent quantizes every note. See “Window” on page 872.

 Randomize. This value randomizes the three previous fields to introduce a more human feel to the rhythm. The value you enter
is the maximum amount of difference from the entered values that the randomize feature can add.
For more information about Input Quantize, see “Input quantizing” on page 357.

Snap Scale Settings dialog
The Snap Scale Settings dialog box appears after selecting Snap Settings in the Snap to Scale section in the Inspector.
The Snap Scale Settings dialog box contains the following settings:

 Adjust to Next, Higher Note. If you choose this option, Cakewalk moves any non-scale note that you move to the next higher
note in the selected scale.

 Adjust to Previous, Lower Note. If you choose this option, Cakewalk moves any non-scale note that you move to the
previous, lower note in the selected scale.

 Adjust to Nearest Note. If you choose this option, Cakewalk moves any non-scale note that you move to the note that is
closest in pitch in the selected scale.
For more information about Snap to Scale, see “Snap to Scale” on page 878.

Track pane
The Track pane lets you see and change the settings for each track. Selected tracks always appear in a different color. The controls
for an individual track are grouped together to form that track’s track strip.
To change the current track, move the highlight using the mouse or the keyboard as follows:
Key

What it does

UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW

Moves the selection to the adjacent track. If a control is selected, the selection moves to the same
control in the adjacent track, or the next track of the same type if the control only applies to a specific
track type (for example, the Patch control only applies to MIDI tracks)

LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW

Moves to the previous or next control in the Track pane. The RIGHT ARROW key moves the selected
control right until reaching the end of a line, and at the end of the line the selection moves to the leftmost control of the line below. The LEFT ARROW key moves the selected control to the left until it
reaches the beginning of a line, and then moves to the end of the line above.

PAGE DOWN

Displays the next page of tracks

PAGE UP

The Track pane contains meters for recording, playback, and bus levels. You can hide or show any or all of these meters, and
choose many different options for the units and format of the data the meters display. See “Metering” on page 1000.

Clips pane
The Clips pane shows the clips in your project on a timeline that helps you visualize how your project is organized. Clips contain
markings that indicate their contents. The Clips pane lets you select, move, and copy clips from place to place to change the
arrangement of music and sound in your project.
The Track view makes it easy to select tracks, clips, and ranges of time in a project. These are the most common selection methods:
To

Do this

Select tracks

Click on the track number (the right side of the track number; the upper left corner of the track number
is for grouping tracks), or drag over several track numbers

Select clips

Click on the clip, or drag a rectangle around several clips

Select time ranges

Drag in the Time Ruler, or click between two markers

As with most other Windows programs, you can also use the SHIFT-click and CTRL-click combinations when selecting tracks and
clips. Holding the SHIFT key while you click adds tracks or clips to the current selection. Holding the CTRL key while you click lets
you toggle the selection status of tracks or clips.

Note: If the Clips pane does not scroll during playback, and the Now Time Marker disappears off-screen, make sure the

Track/Bus Inspector
The Track/Bus Inspector makes it easy to adjust the current track’s (or bus’s) controls, because it’s a greatly expanded version of the
current track’s controls that is located on the left side of the Track pane.
For more information about the Inspector, see “Inspectors” on page 691.

The Navigator pane
The Navigator pane, located just above the Track pane, displays the whole length of your project so you can always see an overview
of your song, and where the Now time is. The Navigator pane displays all of your project’s tracks. To show or hide the Navigator
pane, click the Track view View menu and choose Navigator Show/Hide or press ALT+N. You can drag the splitter bar between the
Navigator pane and the Track pane to change its height.
The Navigator pane has a green rectangle in it that is an outline of what the Clips pane is currently displaying. If you drag the center
of the rectangle around in the pane, it scrolls the Clips pane to the same view. You can drag any of the nodes on the rectangle to
zoom the Clips pane in or out. If you click in the Navigator pane, the left border of the rectangle jumps to the spot you clicked, and

The Piano Roll view displays all MIDI notes and events from one or more tracks in either the Drum Grid pane or the Notes pane. The
Notes pane is a grid format that looks much like a player piano roll. The Drum Grid pane is also laid out in a grid, but the sound of
these drum notes are determined by the settings in the Drum Map pane. In both the Drum Grid pane and the Notes pane, notes are
displayed as horizontal bars.
In the Notes pane, pitch runs from bottom to top, with the left vertical margin indicating the pitches as piano keys or note names.
Time is displayed running left to right with vertical measure and beat boundaries.
In the Drum Grid pane, the drum sounds are mapped according to the current drum map in the Note Map pane. Like the Notes pane,
time is displayed running left to right with vertical measure and beat boundaries.
The Piano Roll view makes it easy to add, edit, and delete MIDI events from a track.
The Piano Roll view consists of the “Notes pane” on page 1800, “Note Map pane” on page 1799, “Drum Grid pane” on page 1799,
the “Controller pane” on page 821, and the “Track pane” on page 1801.

Step Sequencer view
The Step Sequencer makes it easy to compose patterns using a grid, where each cell (step) represents a note. You create patterns
by clicking the cells in the grid to turn notes on or off, or by using step recording.
Many step sequencers use a Piano Roll grid-style interface. Cakewalk already has a very powerful Piano Roll view with similar MIDI
editing functionality, so the purpose of the Step Sequencer is to provide a very different method for working with patterns.
The Step Sequencer is ideally suited for drum programming.
See:
“Step sequencer interface” on page 1802
“Working with rows” on page 1812
“Working with steps” on page 1814
“Working with Controller events” on page 1819

“Working with Step Sequencer clips” on page 1824
“Keyboard shortcuts” on page 1810
“Using the Step Sequencer with drum maps” on page 1823

Step sequencer interface
The Step Sequencer interface consists of five sections:

 Menu. Use the menu to load, save and clear patterns and specify various editing options. For details, see “Step Sequencer view
menu” on page 1803.

 Toolbar. The toolbar contains transport controls and lets you specify the pattern length and behavior when inputting new notes.
For details, see “Toolbar” on page 1804.

 Rows. Each row represents a unique pitch, and has its own independent group of controls. You can insert, delete and reorder
rows. For details, see “Rows” on page 1806 and “Working with rows” on page 1812.

 Notes pane. The Notes pane is where you turn notes on and off to create a pattern. For details, see “Notes pane” on page 1808
and “Working with steps” on page 1814.

 Controllers pane. The Controllers pane is where you can create modulation events, such as Controller, Pitch Wheel, Channel
Aftertouch, RPN and NRPN. For details, see “Controllers pane” on page 1809 and “Working with Controller events” on page 1819.

The Step Sequencer toolbar consists of the following controls:

 Pattern Length. The pattern length is determined by the following settings:
 Beats Per Pattern. This setting specifies the number of beats per pattern. The value range is 1-64 and the default value is 4
beats. Changes are undoable.

 Steps Per Beat. This setting specifies the number of steps per beat. The value range is 1-16 and the default value is 4
steps. Changes are undoable.
Note: When changing the number of steps per beat, you can configure how existing notes are affected. By default, Cakewalk
will preserve the original pattern whenever possible as you add or remove beats. Doing so ensures that notes retain their
original position within each beat. If you prefer, you can instruct Cakewalk to instead append additional steps at the end of each
beat. To toggle the behavior, click the Options menu and select Preserve Pattern for Step Sizes on the drop-down menu
(enabled by default).

1804

Step Sequencer view

 Fit to Quarters. Fit to Quarters will force the pattern duration to fit the specified number of quarter notes.
Note: When you adjust the Fit to Quarters value, the clip duration may change depending on whether or not the clip has been
rolled out to expose additional pattern iterations:
• If the clip has a single pattern iteration. When you change the Fit to Quarters value (number of quarter notes), the clip
duration will continue to equal the length of one pattern iteration. That is, the clip will not be rolled out.
• If the clip has multiple pattern iterations. When you change the Fit to Quarters value (number of quarter notes), the
new clip duration will either equal the old clip duration or the length of the new pattern, whichever is greater.

 Entry Mode Toggle. This button toggles between Monophonic mode and Polyphonic mode, which affects the behavior when
entering new notes. In Monophonic mode, only one note (row) may be assigned for each step. Monophonic mode is useful for
sequencing melodic lines. When you click in a column to enter a new note, any existing notes in the same column will be removed
automatically in Monophonic mode. In Polyphonic mode, you can enter multiple notes in the same column.

 Step Record. The Step Record button toggles step recording on/off. See “To step record notes from a MIDI device” on page
1818.

 Play. The Play button is used to start/stop the Step Sequencer when Cakewalk’s main transport is idle.
 Position Indicator. The Position indicator shows the current measure and beat position in the step sequencer.

Each row represents a specific pitch. Similar to the Drum Editor in the Piano Roll view (in some ways, you can think of a row as a
different way of looking at the Drum Map Manager in “MIDI - Drum Map Manager (Advanced)” on page 1682), the controls for each
row are located at the left side of the row.
You can insert, delete and reorder rows. The current row is outlined to indicate which row has focus.
To expose all controls, click a row’s Select button

. Each row has the following controls:

 Select. Use this button to expose advanced parameters and select the row or rows you want to edit in the Controllers pane. If
multiple rows are selected, the Controllers pane is displayed below the top-most selected row. The Controllers pane is hidden if
no rows are selected. See “To select rows” on page 1813, “To edit controller events on a single row” on page 1819 and “To edit
controller events on multiple rows simultaneously” on page 1820.

 Note Name. This control shows the name of the note to which the row is mapped. Click the note name to audition the pitch. To
rename the note, right-click the row and select Rename Note from the pop-up menu.

 Note Number. Use this control to specify the row’s input note.
 Mute. This button mutes the row/note/pitch.
 Solo. This button solos the row/note/pitch.
 Incoming MIDI activity indicator. This indicator lights up if the row is receiving MIDI input.
 Shared MIDI channel indicator. This indicator lights up if a selected row shares the same MIDI channel as any other row. This
is a convenient reminder that any controller events you insert in the row will also affect all other rows that share the same MIDI
channel.

 Output. Use this control to assign all selected rows to any available software instrument or drum map. You can also access the
Map Properties dialog box from the drop-down menu. By default, each row is assigned to the track’s output. If you assign
different rows to different outputs, the step sequencer will automatically assign the rows to a new drum map (see “Using the Step
Sequencer with drum maps” on page 1823).

 Channel. Use this control to specify the output channel for all selected rows.
 Velocity. Use this control to apply a velocity offset to a pitch. The value range is -127 to +127 and the default value is 0.
 Duration. The Duration knob controls how long each note is held. The value range is 0 to 100% and the default value is 100%
(hold each note for its full duration).

 Swing. The Swing knob controls the amount of swing that is applied to the sequence. The value range is 0 to 100% and the
default value is 50% (no swing).

1806

View reference
Step Sequencer view

The default swing value of 50% means that the beats are spaced evenly. A value of 66% means that the time between the first and
second beats is twice as long as the time between the second and third beats.

 Time offset. This knob lets you apply a time offset to all steps in a row. This is very useful for fine-tuning the rhythm of a pattern.
The value range is -50% to 50% and the default value is 50% (no swing).

 Flam. This knob lets you adjust the timing of any flammed notes. A flam is a quiet “grace” note that is added to the beginning of
a louder “primary” note, resulting in a fuller sounding note when played almost simultaneously. The value range is -50% to 50%.
With a value of 50%, the flam is hit exactly in the middle of the step. See “To add/remove a flam” on page 1817.

Row context menu
You can right-click any row to access the following commands:

 Insert Row. Click to insert a new row. For details, see “To insert a row” on page 1812.

Indicator indicates the current position with a red light

.

2. On your MIDI input device, play the note(s) that you would like to assign to the current step (as indicated by the red light in the
Position Indicator).
The Step Sequencer will listen for any and all notes that are pressed until a note is released, at which time the notes that were
pressed will be turned on and the Step Sequencer will automatically advance to the next step. The following rules apply when
step recording:

 If the pitch that is pressed is already mapped to a row in the Step Sequencer, then the note is turned on.
 If the pitch that is pressed is not mapped to a row in the Step Sequencer, then the step is skipped.
 Undo (CTRL+Z) will undo the most recent step entry and move the current position back by one step.
3. To disable step recording, right-click the Play button again or press CTRL+R.
The Play button changes back to its normal state

.

Specifying Velocity for Step Recording
You can specify whether step recording should use the recorded velocity or a fixed velocity value for new notes. To toggle between
the two behaviors, right-click on the Step Sequencer toolbar and select Use Fixed/Default Velocity for Step Recording from the
pop-up menu.
For more information about configuring the default velocity value, see “To specify the default velocity value for new notes” on page

Using the Step Sequencer with drum maps
By default, all rows in a Step Sequencer clip are assigned to the track’s output port, which could be a hardware MIDI port, a software
instrument, or a drum map.
If you re-assign rows to different output ports, the Step Sequencer will automatically assign the rows to a new drum map.
The following diagram illustrates how the Drum Editor in the Piano Roll view, the Step Sequencer and the Drum Map Properties
dialog box are all interconnected when using a drum map.

B

A. Note Name B. Notes C. Mute, Solo, Velocity and Velocity Multiplier are separate for the drum map and step sequencer

A change made in the Drum Map Manager dialog box will affect the Step Sequencer and vice versa.
Note: Mute, Solo, Velocity and Velocity Multiplier are separate for the drum map and step sequencer.

To edit the drum map properties of a note
1. Click a row’s Select button

to show all controls for the selected row.

2. Click the Output control and select Open Drum Map Manager from the drop-down menu.
The Map Properties dialog box appears.

Working with Step Sequencer clips
When you create a sequence in the Step Sequencer, Cakewalk creates a new Step Sequencer clip.
A Step Sequencer clip shows the first iteration of the sequence/pattern and all Step Sequencer clips can be identified by a small Step
Sequencer clip icon
in the top right corner of the clip. Step sequencer clips are somewhat similar to MIDI Groove clips; you can
drag the left and right edges of a Step Sequencer clip to show additional iterations of the sequence pattern.

To convert a MIDI clip(s) to a Step Sequencer clip(s)
You can convert any existing MIDI clip into a step sequencer clip:
1. Select the MIDI clip(s) you want to convert to a step sequencer clip(s).
2. Right-click the selected clip and choose Convert MIDI Clip(s) to Step Sequencer from the Clips pane context menu (hover the
mouse over the bottom of the context menu in order to show any “hidden” commands).
The Convert MIDI Clip(s) to Step Sequencer dialog box appears.
3. If you want the Step Sequencer to preserve the original timing of the note events instead of quantizing them to the nearest step,
select Preserve original timing (using step offsets). The notes will be adjusted to fit the steps, and per-step timing offsets will
be created so that the result has the same note times as the original MIDI clip. Any human feel in the part will be preserved.
If Preserve original timing (using step offsets) is not selected, the resulting clip will essentially be a quantized version of the
original clip. The start of the clips will be the same and the first notes will be the same. The only thing that will possibly be
different is the length of the clip (due to quantizing) and the notes in it may be moved slightly so they fit into the steps.
4. Specify the desired resolution value and click OK.
Note: The resolution value should correspond to the shortest note value that you expect. For example, if you specify Sixteenth
notes, you will get four steps per beat. The choices are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Quarter (1 step per beat)
Eighth (2 steps per beat)
Eighth Triplet (3 steps per beat)
Sixteenth (4 steps per beat)
Sixteenth Triplet (6 steps per beat)
32nd (8 steps per beat)
32nd Triplet (12 steps per beat)

If a MIDI Groove clip contains any variations between different iterations, each unique iteration will be converted to a separate Step
Sequencer clip.

To unlink copied Step Sequencer clips
When you copy step sequencer clips, all copies are linked to each other. This means that any further edits to any of the clips will be
automatically reflected in all other linked sibling clips.
If you want to edit one instance of a step sequencer clip without affecting any other clips, you must first unlink the clip you want to
edit:
1. Right-click the step sequencer clip in the Clips pane to show the Clips pane context menu.
2. Select Unlink Step Sequencer Clips from the context menu (point the mouse over the bottom of the context menu in order to
show any “hidden” commands).
The clip is now unlinked from the other clips.
Tip: If you frequently need to unlink step sequencer clips, assign the Unlink Step Sequencer Clips to a key binding (see “Key
bindings” on page 1261).

Video view
Open the Video view by using the Views > Video command or by pressing ALT+SHIFT+2. In addition to the Video view, there is also
a Video Thumbnails pane in the Track view (see “Using the Video Thumbnails pane” on page 339). The File > Import > Video
command lets you include an AVI, MPEG, or QuickTime video in your project. This video is shown in the Video view in real time as
your project plays. The Video view displays the current time (as in the Big Time view) and the video itself. The display in the Video
view is synchronized with the Now time, giving you convenient random access to the video stream. This makes it easy to align music
and digitized sound to the video.
If the Video view is the active window, you can now use keyboard shortcuts to advance by a frame or a frame increment. The +/-,
and left/right arrow keys move forward/backwards by a single frame. If the control key is pressed, then the frame increment value is
used (default = 5 frames) Alternatively you can use the [ and ] keys to seek by the frame increment.
Commands in the Video view's pop-up menu let you set the time display format, the size and stretch options for the video display,
the video start and trim times, and other options. Your project's video and digital audio data can be saved together in a new AVI file
by using the File > Export > Video command. For more information, see “Exporting audio” on page 1135.
Note: The project's video file is saved in the project by reference only; the actual video data remains in the original file.

Use these options in the Video File dialog box:
Look in.

Use this field to find the folder that contains the video file you want to insert.

The following is a list of the controls in the Loop Construction view, followed by a description. For step-by-step instructions, see the
links at the end of this section.

Clip menu
The Clip menu contains the following commands:

 Save Loop. Opens the Save As dialog box. In the Save As dialog box you can save the current loop (Groove clip) as a Riff
Wave file, which are compatible with ACIDized loops. You can save Riff Wave files for use with another Cakewalk project or with
ACID.

 Loop On/Off. Groove Clip enable/disable. When enabled, loop clips in the Track view by dragging the right side of a clip with
your mouse. When disabled, you are able to slip-edit the clip.

 Stretch On/Off. Instructs Cakewalk to stretch or shrink the clip to fit the project’s tempo. The Beats in Clip and Original BPM
parameters are in the Clip Properties Inspector and Loop Properties dialog box are used to make the change.

 Loop Properties. Opens the Loop Properties dialog box.
Note: The settings in the Loop Properties dialog box are also available in the Groove Clip section in the Clip Properties
Inspector.

Slice menu
The Slice menu contains the following commands:

 Reset Markers. Restores all automatically generated markers to the original position and enables all those that were disabled.
Manually created markers remain as is.

 Show/Hide Gain Envelope. Toggles on or off the display of a gain envelope.
 Show/Hide Pan Envelope. Toggles on or off the display of a pan envelope.
 Show/Hide Pitch Envelope. Toggles on or off the display of a pitch envelope.
 Next Slice. Moves the slice selection to the next slice in the loop. You can also press the PAGE DOWN key.
 Previous Slice. Moves the slice selection to the previous slice in the loop. You can also press the PAGE UP key.

Options menu
The Options menu contains the following commands:

 Auto Slice Preview On/Off. Turns on slice auto preview.
 Auto Slice Preview Loop On/Off. This control is only available if the Enable Slice Auto Preview option is on. This option
loops the slice auto preview.

 Preview Bus.

Controls
 Preview

. Plays the current loop repeatedly. Click again to stop preview.

 Loop. Click the Loop button to loop clips in the Track view by dragging the right side of a clip with your mouse. When Loop is
not on, you are able to slip-edit the clip.

 Resolution. The slice Resolution control sets the resolution for the creation of markers, or the “slicing” of the looped clip. This
control uses the following note durations:

 No Slice
 Whole Note
 1/2 Note
 1/4 Note
 1/8 Note
 1/16 Note
 1/32 Note
The automatic markers appear at the note resolutions according to the Resolution setting. At the eighth note setting, there are
eight markers per measure.
This control works well for slicing audio that has more subtle changes in volume with few dramatic transients.
The markers in a loop clip preserve the timing of the audio at that moment. Too few or too many markers can cause unwanted
“artifacts” when a loop clip is stretched.

 Threshold. The Threshold control senses transients in your audio clip and assigns a marker at the beginning and end of each
one it finds. As you increase the number in this field, smaller transients are detected and the number of markers increases.

 Beats. The number of beats (quarter notes) in the clip.
 BPM. The tempo at which the clip was recorded.
 Pitch. The Follow Project Pitch option transposes the loop, if necessary, to the key of the project. A loop recorded in the key of
A, used in a project in the key of C, would be transposed up three semitones if the Follow Project Pitch check box was checked.

 Root Note. The Root Note represents the key in which the loop was recorded. The Follow Project Pitch feature uses this
information, when checked, to transpose the loop to match the project’s key.

 Coarse Pitch. You can set the transposition of a clip, independent from the project pitch, using the Coarse Pitch field. A
positive number transposes the clip up by that number of semitones. A negative number transposes the clip down by that number
of semitones. Remember that, if the Follow Project Pitch option is checked, the clip follows the project’s pitch, so any
transposition changes you make using this option are changes to the project pitch, not the clip pitch.
An example: The project key is C. The clip key is D. If the Follow Project Pitch option is checked, the clip is transposed down by
two semitones. A value entered into the Pitch (semitone) field adjusts the pitch from C. If you enter “-1” the pitch would be
transposed down by one additional semitone to B.
Another example: The clip pitch is E. The desired clip pitch is D. If the Follow Project Pitch option is not checked, and a value
of “2” is entered in the Pitch (semitones) field, the clip is transposed down two semitones to D from the original pitch of E.

 Fine Pitch. The Pitch (fine) field allows you to make tuning adjustments or to transpose the pitch of a clip up to 50 cents. There
are 100 cents in one semitone. A Pitch (fine) setting of 1 adjusts the pitch up one hundredth of a semitone. The Pitch (fine) option
can “fine tune” a slightly out of tune clip so that it is in pitch with the remaining clips in a project.

Slicing markers

There are two types of slicing markers in the Loop Construction view: automatic and manual. Automatic markers appear in red and
are automatically generated by Cakewalk when you loop enable a clip. The one exception to this is if you import an ACIDized wave
file into Cakewalk. ACIDized files always appear with manual slicing markers. Manual markers appear in purple. If you add a marker
or move an automatic marker, it turns purple to show you that it has been edited. For information on editing slicing markers, see “To
edit the slicing markers in a Groove Clip” on page 809.

Beat markers

Beat Markers mark where the beats fall in your clip. There are as many beat markers as there are beats in a clip.

Audio scaling
Audio scaling is the increase or decrease in the size (scale) of the waveform in clip. Audio scaling allows you to make detailed edits
by zooming in on the parts of the waveform closest to the zero crossing (silence) while preserving the track size. By showing just the
quietest parts of a clip, you can make very precise edits.
The Audio Scale Ruler is located on the far left of the Loop Construction view.
Figure 692. Audio scale ruler.

A

B

A. Audio Scale Ruler B. Clip

There are three right-click display options in the Audio Scale Ruler:

 Percentage. Shows audio scaling by percentage. For example, if the highest percentage in the Audio Scale Ruler reads 2.0%,
then only the parts of the waveform which are within 2% of the zero crossing appear in the clip.

 dB. Shows audio scaling by dB. For example, if the highest dB in the Audio Scaling Ruler reads -36, then only the parts of the
waveform which are 36 dB below 0 dB appear in the clip.

 Zoom Factor. Shows audio scaling by a factor. For example, if the Zoom Factor reads 10, then the waveform is zoomed in by a
factor of 10.

Matrix view
The Matrix view lets you trigger individual or multiple audio and MIDI patterns, either with a computer keyboard, mouse or via MIDI
remote control. The Matrix view consists of a grid, with unlimited rows and columns. You can drag audio, MIDI Groove Clips, Step
Sequencer patterns and Project5 patterns to cells in the grid, and each row can be routed to any track in your project. You can record
the Matrix performance to the Clips pane.
The Matrix view can be used as a stand-alone pattern trigger, or it can be synchronized with your project during playback.
There are many uses for the Matrix view, including:

The Matrix view toolbar contains the following controls:

 Stop All Cells

. When the Stop All Cells button is enabled, all playing cells stop. The small arrow next to the Stop All Cells
button lets you access a drop-down menu with the following commands:

 Clear All Cells. This command lets you clear the content from all cells.
 Clear All MIDI Learn. This command lets you clear MIDI Learn assignments from all cells.
 Capture Matrix Performance

. When the Capture Matrix Performance button is enabled, you can record the current
Matrix performance into the Clips pane during playback. Rows are recorded to their assigned output tracks. For details, see “To
record a performance into the Clips pane” on page 1878. You can also perform a Quick Capture of a single pattern. For details,
see “To render a single pattern to the Clips pane (Quick Capture)” on page 1878.

 Follow Transport

. This toggle lets you specify if the Matrix view should follow Cakewalk’s main transport (Play/Stop)
commands. When Follow Transport is enabled, patterns will only play when Cakewalk’s transport is rolling. When Follow
Transport is disabled, you can play the Matrix while Cakewalk’s transport is idle (if you start Cakewalk’s transport in this mode,
cells that are already playing will immediately update their positions to synchronize with Cakewalk’s transport). For details, see
“To synchronize the Matrix with Cakewalk’s transport” on page 1872.

 Trigger Resolution

. This menu lets you specify the time lag between when you trigger a column or cell, and when
it starts/stops playing. The options are as follows:
• Immediate. Playback starts immediately.
• Next Measure. Playback starts on the next measure boundary. This is the default setting.
• Next Beat. Playback starts on the next beat.
• Next 1/8 Note. Playback starts on the next 8th note.

 Cell Start

/
. This toggle lets you specify globally if a pattern should start from the beginning of the pattern, or if playback
may start in the middle of a pattern in order to synchronize with the project’s Now time. The two modes are as follows:

 Always from Beginning

. When you trigger a cell, the pattern will start playing from the beginning of the pattern, after
the amount of time listed in the Trigger Resolution menu.

 Offset to Now Time

. When you trigger a cell, the pattern will start playing in sync with the Now time after the amount of
time listed in the Trigger Resolution menu. It’s as if the cell’s pattern is repeated throughout the song and you unmute the
pattern at a certain point. This is the default setting.

 Cell MIDI Trigger

. This toggle lets you enable/disable MIDI control over the Matrix view. Click the small arrow next to the
Cell MIDI Trigger button to specify which MIDI channel the Matrix view should respond to (select Omni for all channels).

 Options

.

Click the Options button to open the Matrix Options dialog box. The following options are available:

 Empty cells stop active cells when triggered. This option determines how playing cells are affected when triggering an
empty cell in the same row. If Empty cells stop active cells when triggered is disabled (default), triggering an empty cell
has no effect on other cells. If Empty cells stop active cells when triggered is selected, triggering an empty cell in a row will
force the row to stop playing. Likewise, triggering a column that contains empty cells will force the corresponding row to stop
playing. This option is disabled by default.

 AutoScroll to Column when Triggered by MIDI. This option allows the Matrix view to automatically scroll a column into
view if one of the column’s cells are triggered by MIDI.

 Import all audio as GrooveClips. This option forces all audio to be imported as Groove Clips.
 Follow Transport Restores Pending Cells on Stop. When Follow Transport

is enabled, you can queue up multiple
cells to trigger when the transport starts. If Follow Transport Restores Pending Cells on Stop is enabled, all cells that were
queued up to trigger will be pending again when the transport stops, even if the cells were manually stopped during playback.

 Unlink Step Sequencer clips from Clips pane. When you drag a Step Sequencer clip to a Matrix cell, the clip data and cell
data are linked. If you want the original clip and Matrix cell to be independent, clear the Unlink Step Sequencer clips from
Clips pane check box.

A row is a horizontal collection of cells that is routed to a specific track in your project. Only one cell per row may be triggered at a
time.
Tip: To play multiple patterns through the same track simultaneously, assign multiple rows to the same track.

A row contains the following controls:

 Row number

. Sequential number to identify each row.

 Data type icon

/
. The icon indicates if the row contains audio data
or MIDI data . Rows that are assigned to audio
tracks can only contain cells with audio data. Likewise, rows that are routed to MIDI or Instrument tracks can only contain cells
with MIDI data. The Audio or MIDI identity of a row is established when the first pattern is dragged into the row.

 Direct Mode (MIDI rows only)

. By default, a MIDI row is routed through the assigned MIDI track, and all track processing is
applied, including MIDI FX, Arpeggiator, volume, etc. To bypass all track processing and send a row directly to the soft synth or
hardware output that is assigned to the target track, click the row’s Direct Mode button

 Mute

 Destination track. Each row displays the name of the track it is routed to. All cells in the row are routed through the assigned
track. Click the small arrow to reassign the row to another track.
The Matrix view supports unlimited rows. Rows are created automatically when you drag patterns into the Matrix view. Each row
displays the name of the track it is routed to. Whenever a new row is created in the Matrix view, a corresponding track is also
inserted in the project. New rows are named Matrix row “n”.
All rows that are assigned to the project’s active track are highlighted. The active tracks is synchronized with the Track view and
Console view, and you can set the active track by clicking a row in the Matrix view. In the following image, track 2 is the active track,
so all rows that are assigned to track 2 are highlighted.

A column is a vertical collection of cells, with one cell per row.
Above each column is a Column Trigger, which lets you simultaneously trigger all cells in a column. Just like cells, the Column
Trigger can be triggered with a mouse or via MIDI remote control. If you trigger a column, all other cells in the Matrix will be turned
off, since only one cell per row may be triggered.
The Matrix view supports unlimited columns. A column is created automatically when at least one cell in the column contains a
pattern.
Tip: If you frequently need to trigger multiple patterns simultaneously, arrange the patterns into columns, then use the Column Triggers
above the columns to trigger the patterns.
You can right-click a Column Trigger to access the following commands:

 Rename Column. Use this command to assign a custom name to a column header. By default, a column does not display any
name. For details, see “To rename a column header” on page 1875.

 Insert Column. Use this command to insert a new blank column. For details, see “To insert a new empty column” on page 1875.
 Duplicate Column. Use this command to duplicate an entire column. For details, see “To duplicate an existing column” on page
1875.

 Clear Column. Use this command to clear all cells in the column. For details, see “To clear all cells in a column” on page 1875.
 MIDI Learn. Use this command to assign a MIDI event to a Column Trigger, which allows you to trigger all cells in the column
via MIDI remote control. The MIDI Learn command shows an orange outline around the Column Trigger if it is already in MIDI
Learn mode, and shows a small MIDI icon if there is already a MIDI event assigned to the Column Trigger.

 Clear MIDI Learn. Use this command to remove any MIDI assignment from the Column Trigger. The column will no longer be
triggered via MIDI remote control.

A. Filled cells (contain patterns) B. Column trigger (click to play all cells in a column) C. Empty cell D. Playing cell with progress indicator

The Matrix view is a grid of unlimited cells arranged into rows and columns.
A cell is simply a pattern holder. You can drag one pattern into each cell, or leave the cell empty. By default, a cell displays the name
of the assigned pattern, but the cell can be renamed.
You can trigger cells by clicking with a mouse or via MIDI remote control. Only one cell per row can be triggered at a time. Patterns
repeat themselves until you stop playback or until another pattern in the same row starts to play.
A cell blinks when it is triggered but not yet playing. In this state, the cell has been queued for playback, and will play as soon as the
current Trigger Resolution is reached.
During playback, a cell displays a “play” icon and a circular progress indicator to show the position of the loop as it is playing.
A filled cell contains the following controls:

To open the Matrix view
 Do one of the following:
 Select Views > Matrix view.
 Press ALT+5.
To assign a pattern to a cell
You can drag audio, MIDI Groove Clips, Step Sequencer patterns and Project5 patterns from the Media Browser view or from the
Clips pane into the Matrix view. Do one of the following:

 To assign a pattern to a cell in an existing row. Do one of the following:
 Drag a pattern to the desired cell in an existing row.
 Right-click a cell and select Import File on the context menu.
 To assign a pattern to a cell in an empty row. If you drag a pattern to an empty row, you can specify if the new row should be
assigned to an existing track or to a new corresponding track:

 To create a new row and assign it to the most recently created or assigned track. Drag a pattern to the desired cell in
an empty row.

 To create a new row and corresponding track. Hold down the ALT key and drag a pattern to the desired cell in an empty
row.
Any new rows and tracks that are created by the Matrix are named “Matrix Row n”.
When dragging a clip from the Clips pane, the cell will automatically inherit the clip name and color. If the clip has no name, the
cell will be named “Audio” or “MIDI”.
Note 1: Rows that are assigned to audio tracks can only contain cells with audio data. Likewise, rows that are routed to MIDI
or Instrument tracks can only contain cells with MIDI data. The Audio or MIDI identity of a row is established when the first
pattern is dragged into the row.

Note 2: When you drag a clip from the Clips pane and drop it in the Matrix view, the Matrix view will use the entire raw clip data,
even if the clip is cropped. If you want the Matrix view to only use the uncropped part of the clip, first use the Track view Clips >
Bounce to Clip(s) command to create a new clip. If you want the clip to loop smoothly, you may also want to convert the new
clip to a Groove clip and edit it in the Loop Construction view before you drag it into the Matrix view.

Tip: If you want to always import audio as Groove Clips, click the Options button
click the Import all audio as GrooveClips check box.

to open the Matrix Options dialog box, then

To assign multiple patterns to subsequent rows
1. Select multiple patterns in the Media Browser view or the Clips pane.
2. Drag the selected patterns to the desired target cell.
The first pattern is assigned to the target cell, and any additional patterns are assigned to subsequent rows below the target cell.

To assign multiple patterns to subsequent columns
1. Select multiple patterns in the Media Browser view or the Clips pane.
2. Hold down the SHIFT key and drag the selected patterns to the desired target cell.
The first pattern is assigned to the target cell, and any additional patterns are assigned to subsequent columns the right of the
target cell.

To remove a pattern from a cell
 Do one of the following:
 Click the cell then press the DELETE key.
 Right-click the cell and select Clear Cell from the pop-up menu.
 Drag the pattern to a different cell.

To remove all patterns
 Click the arrow next to the Stop All Cells button

in the Matrix view toolbar and select Clear All Cells from the drop-down

menu.

To edit cell content
Individual MIDI cell content can be edited with the Step Sequencer, and audio cell content can be edited with the Loop Construction
view.
To edit a cell, do one of the following:

 Double-click the cell background.
 Select an audio cell and press ALT+7.
 Select a MIDI Step Sequencer cell and press ALT+4.
If you want to edit MIDI cells that don’t contain Step Sequencer content, you must first convert the MIDI data to Step Sequencer data.
To do so, select the cell(s) you want to convert, then right-click the cell and select Convert MIDI Clip(s) to Step Sequencer on the
pop-up menu.
To create a new Step Sequencer cell, right-click an empty cell and select Create New Step Sequencer Cell on the pop-up menu.

To specify how soon a pattern should start playing after being triggered
When you trigger a cell or column, playback starts after the amount of time that is selected in the Cell Trigger Time
menu in the Matrix view toolbar.

 Click the Trigger Resolution menu and select one of the available options:
• Immediate. Playback starts immediately.
• Next Measure. Playback starts on the next measure boundary.
• Next Beat. Playback starts on the next beat.
• Next 1/8.

Playback starts on the next 8th note.

• Next 1/16. Playback starts on the next 16th note.
• Next 1/32 Note.

Playback starts on the next 32th note.

• Next 1/64 Note.

Playback starts on the next 64th note.

After a cell has been triggered, the cell blinks until the Trigger Resolution is reached, at which time playback starts.

To start a pattern from its beginning
 Make sure the Cell Start toggle is in Always from Beginning mode

before you trigger the pattern.

Tip: To trigger a cell using the opposite mode of the current Cell Start setting, hold down the ALT key when you trigger the cell.

To configure a cell as “one-shot”
 Right-click the cell and select One-Shot Trigger on the context menu.
The Loop Mode and Latch Mode buttons in the cell are hidden. When One-Shot Trigger mode is enabled, loop and latch
settings are ignored, and the cell only plays one repetition from beginning to end.
To disable One-Shot Trigger mode, right-click the cell and select One-Shot Trigger on the context menu.

To synchronize a pattern with the project’s Now time
 Make sure the Cell Start toggle is in Offset to Now Time mode

before you trigger the pattern.

Tip: To trigger a cell using the opposite mode of the current Cell Start setting, hold down the ALT key when you trigger the cell.

When you trigger a cell in Offset to Now Time mode, the pattern will start playing in sync with the Now time after the amount of
time listed in the Trigger Resolution menu. It’s as if the cell’s pattern is repeated throughout the song and you unmute the
pattern at a certain point.

To trigger a cell
 Do one of the following:
 Click the desired cell.
 Use the ARROW keys on your computer keyboard to navigate to the desired cell, then press ENTER.
 If the cell has been assigned to a MIDI event, press the appropriate key, pad or button on your MIDI controller. For details, see
“To trigger a cell or column via MIDI remote control” on page 1874.

 After the cell has been triggered, the cell blinks until the Trigger Resolution is reached, at which time playback starts.
The global Cell Start toggle determines if the pattern will play from the beginning of the pattern or synchronize to the project’s
Now time. In Always from Beginning mode
, patterns always start from the beginning. In Offset to Now Time mode
patterns synchronize to the project’s Now time.

,

Tip: To trigger a cell using the opposite mode of the current Cell Start setting, hold down the ALT key when you trigger the cell.

During playback, the cell displays a “play” icon and a circular progress indicator to show the position of the loop as it is playing.
Patterns repeat themselves until you stop playback or until another pattern in the same row starts to play (non-looped content play
as one-shots, meaning the patterns play only once).
Note 1: Only one cell per row can be triggered at a time. You can trigger multiple cells simultaneously as long as they are
located in different rows.

Note 2: Together, the Global Latch Mode and Global Loop Mode toggles give you flexible control over how cells are triggered.

Virtual Controller/Keyboard
The on-screen MIDI keyboard can be routed to MIDI and Instrument tracks, and lets you easily record a performance using a
mouse, computer keyboard or by tapping on a multi-touch-enabled monitor.
Cakewalk automatically detects whether or not you are using a touchscreen, and sizes the Virtual Controller accordingly. The
optimum size is displayed for either touch or mouse input, regardless of screen resolution.

To assign the Virtual Controller to a MIDI or Instrument track
Click the track’s Input control, point to Virtual Controller, then select the desired input channel (Omni or 1-16).
The Input control is available in the Track Inspector and Track view.

Surround panner
The large surround panner has the following controls:

 Angle and Focus marker. A small sphere that you can drag in any direction to both control and display the following two
parameters:

 Angle. This is the perceived angle of the sound source as it differs from the position directly in front of the listener. The scale
is 0 to 180 degrees on the listener’s right, and 0 to -180 degrees on the listener’s left. 0 means the sound is coming from
directly in front of the listener, and plus or minus 180 degrees means that the sound is coming from directly behind the listener.

 Focus. This is the perceived distance of the sound source from the center of the circle on a scale of 0 to 100, 0 meaning the
center of the circle, and 100 meaning the perimeter.

 Width markers. These are two smaller spheres equidistant from the Angle and Focus marker. Their distance from each other
and from the front of the circle shows the Width value (see definition below). You can also drag the Width markers to control Angle
and Focus.

 Speaker icons/squares. Each surround channel is represented by a speaker icon in the large panner, and a white square in
the small panner. The large panner also has a corresponding volume level in dB directly in front of each icon. The position of each
speaker icon shows you each speaker’s position in the surround mix. Clicking a speaker icon or square mutes the corresponding
channel, causing the icon or square to become gray.

 Angle slider. This slider both displays and controls the angle value.
 Focus slider. This slider both displays and controls the focus value.
 Width slider. This slider both displays and controls the width value. Width is a measure of how wide an area the sound seems
to be coming from on a scale of 0 to 360 degrees. At 0 and 360 degrees, the sound seems to all come from a single speaker. At
180 degrees the sound seems to come from directly opposite sides. The default angle matches the project’s left and right channel
angle. For example, in 5.1 SMPTE/ITU surround, the default width is 60 degrees.

 Front/Rear Balance slider (large panner only). Abbreviated as FrntRrBl, this slider adjusts the front and rear balance. Drag it
to the left to reduce the level from the front speakers, or drag it to the right to reduce rear level.

 LFE slider. This slider both displays and controls the level of sound sent to the LFE channel.
 LFE Only button (large panner only). This button mutes all channels except the LFE channel.

Note: A plus sign (+) indicates that both keys must be held down at the same time. For example, CTRL+F6.

Note: Keyboard shortcuts are based on the US keyboard layout. Other languages may use different layouts. Shortcuts are
denoted by the key, not by the character they produce. Many keys produce different characters on non-US keyboards.
